1,China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak,"['.  China cannot take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite the country's efforts to contain the virus, the pandemic has spread all around the world, infecting millions and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. China also drew intense criticism for its handling of the initial outbreak, particularly for its lack of transparency and delays in informing the international community. Therefore, it is too early to declare victory while the global community is still struggling to respond to the pandemic. A victory lap is generally seen as a celebratory gesture after a major accomplishment. China has put forth a considerable effort in taking steps to limit the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, but it is unclear whether or not the country would want to be seen as ""taking a victory lap"" at this time. The situation is still very much evolving, and it is unclear what the future holds. Regardless of how the situation progresses, it is important to recognize the steps taken by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak..  China has certainly made some major strides in battling the coronavirus, including quickly mobilizing its citizens and health care system to detect and contain the virus, as well as developing a vaccine. However, the country has also been criticized for its handling of the outbreak, ranging from its initial response to its lack of transparency when it comes to the spread of the virus. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for China to take a victory lap over its response.']",
2,Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government,"['The spread of disinformation about the coronavirus is creating major challenges for China's government. Misinformation about the virus has appeared on Chinese social media sites, as well as international ones, such as Twitter and Facebook. This false information ranges from questions about the origin of the virus to improper treatment advice, making it difficult for citizens to understand the true risks associated with the virus.  The Chinese government has responded with censorship, but this has been criticized by other countries as an infringement on free speech. Additionally, the Chinese government has struggled to contain the rapid spread of false information online by monitoring and deleting posts containing false information. This effort can be frustrating and difficult, as the false information is spread quickly and new false information appears almost as soon as old information is taken down.  To combat this, the Chinese government has launched several public service campaigns to provide accurate information about the virus and encourage citizens to get their information from reliable sources. In addition, China is working with foreign countries to develop more effective strategies for fighting the spread of disinformation. This includes sharing best practices for detecting and taking down false information, as well as increasing cooperation with international social media companies to help remove false information quickly.  The spread of coronavirus disinformation and conspiracy theories on the internet has created a number of challenges for China's government. The Chinese government has sought to control what citizens are allowed to read and share online. However, the ease with which viral rumors and conspiracy theories can spread on social media makes it difficult for the government to control the narrative about the virus.  The government has responded to these challenges by engaging in censorship and propaganda efforts, as well as launching legal action against those who spread false information. In addition, Chinese tech giants have introduced measures to identify and remove false information, while also providing citizens with official, accurate information about the virus. In addition, the government has also encouraged citizens to report misinformation online, while also offering them incentives, such as rewards and recognition, to do so.  As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, it is likely that the challenges posed by coronavirus misinformation will only become more pronounced. China's government must continue to be vigilant in countering misinformation and conspiracy theories, while also ensuring that its citizens have access to accurate and up-to-date information about the virus.']",
3,China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy,"['In an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Chinese government has made the consumption of wild animals illegal across the country.   The ban, which came into effect on February 24, was announced after the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention determined that the virus was likely transmitted from “illegal wildlife markets” in Wuhan – where the outbreak originated.  Despite the ban, ending the trade of wild animals will not be easy. It has been a longstanding tradition in many parts of China and is deeply rooted in culture and economics. The trade is also conducted through a complex network of markets, brokers, and operators, making it difficult to implement and enforce a ban.  In addition, the illegal wildlife trade is often linked to other criminal activities, such as smuggling and poaching, which makes enforcement even more challenging. Furthermore, China’s large population and vast territory mean that it will be difficult to monitor the country’s entire wildlife trade.  Despite these challenges, the Chinese government is committed to ending the illegal wildlife trade. It has launched an extensive public awareness campaign to discourage the trade and is working closely with the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations to coordinate a plan for long-term enforcement.   The Chinese government is also working to increase the enforcement of existing wildlife protection laws and promote sustainable development in rural areas, to discourage poaching and trafficking. While the ban is a good start, it remains to be seen if it is enough to end the illegal wildlife trade in China.']",
4,China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus,"['pandemic. The outbreak has caused factories and businesses to shut down, leading to millions of lost jobs and reduced consumption. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that the Chinese economy will shrink by 6.6%, while a number of private sector economists believe it could shrink by as much as 8%. This would be the first contraction in the Chinese economy since 1976. China has recently implemented a number of stimulus measures to try to counter the economic damage caused by the virus, including tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending. pandemic. The impact of the virus on businesses, consumer spending, and investment means that the economy could contract in 2020. It is unclear how deep the contraction will be, but some estimates have the economy shrinking by more than 4% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. The virus has also caused huge uncertainty in the global economy, and economists are warning of a global recession. China is taking steps to offset the economic impact of the virus, including increased fiscal spending and monetary easing, but it is unclear how effective these measures will be in the long run. pandemic. The country's GDP could fall between 6% and 10% in 2020, according to experts. That would be the first contraction since China began modernizing its economy in the late 1970s. The economic slowdown could also put millions of Chinese out of work and limit the government’s ability to invest in key infrastructure projects. China's government has already taken several steps to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, including tax cuts and increased spending. It is also developing new economic policies to support small businesses and address increasing levels of poverty.']",
5,China and Japan's budding relationship in the time of coronavirus,"['The novel coronavirus has posed a great challenge to the relationship between China and Japan. After the first wave of coronavirus hit Wuhan, China, the relationship between the two countries has not been as strong as it was before. China and Japan both depend heavily on world trade and tourism, and the economic impact of the pandemic has adversely affected their economies.  The two countries have struggled to maintain cooperation in the face of the pandemic. Japan has provided assistance to China in the form of donations of medical supplies and equipment, but Japan has also raised concerns about the potential for Chinese firms to buy up Japanese companies that are suffering from the economic effects of the pandemic. There have been reports that China is attempting to ""weaponize"" the virus with its Belt and Road Initiative, which has further deteriorated the relationship between the two countries.  However, it is important to note that the relationship between China and Japan is seeing a sudden thaw. At the end of June, China and Japan decided to end their dispute over ""comfort women"", a major point of contention between the two countries since the early 1990s. This is the first time that the two countries have successfully resolved a major problem in their relationship since the 1990s.  The coronavirus pandemic has also highlighted the importance of cooperation between the two countries. In March, Japan provided more than 1,000 respirators to China, and just a few months later, China donated 5 million masks to Japan. In addition, both sides have participated in joint research projects, such as a joint effort to develop antiviral treatments for the virus.  Though the coronavirus has posed a challenge to the relationship between China and Japan, it has also opened up a new opportunity for the two countries to strengthen their relationship by cooperating on critical issues such as health and humanitarian aid.']",
6,Coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic',"['with widespread implications for businesses and individuals across the globe. The rapid spread of the virus has resulted in the shutdown of industries and businesses and a significant drop in global output and investment. As a result, millions of people have lost their jobs, incomes have been reduced and global markets have been plunged into turmoil. With further disruption to global supply chains, increased travel restrictions and a significant fall in demand, the economic impacts of the virus are being felt worldwide. Governments have responded with a variety of measures to support businesses and individuals, including subsidies, liquidity injections and relief funds. However, there is still a need for additional steps to protect the global economy and ensure long-term economic stability.  Coronavirus is quickly becoming an economic pandemic, causing serious damage to businesses worldwide. The spread of the virus has led to travel bans, lockdowns and other restrictions, severely impacting the global economy. Businesses are facing decreased revenues and rising costs, putting economic growth at risk and potentially creating a recession. The already fragile global economy is being rocked by the virus, making it difficult for many companies and countries to weather this storm. Governments and central banks around the world have implemented measures to help provide some relief, but much more will be needed to prevent a prolonged downturn. due to the devastating effects it is having on global economies. Industries across the board have had to shut down, furlough staff, and reduce their workforce due to the sudden loss of demand resulting from the global pandemic. Governments have, in turn, been forced to introduce unprecedented levels of economic stimulus packages in order to try and offset some of the damage caused by the Coronavirus. This stimulus, in the form of increased public spending and reduced taxes, aims to increase liquidity and encourage greater spending within the economy as well as providing more support to those businesses and individuals who have been hit hardest. Despite this, many economists have suggested that the long-term impact of Coronavirus could be very damaging to global economies and currencies, with some even predicting large-scale falls in GDP.']",
7,"A history of Wuhan, one-time Chinese capital and coronavirus epicenter","['Wuhan, located in Hubei Province in central China, is one of China’s 17 ancient cities. With a history of more than 3,500 years, Wuhan has served as a major center of trade and transportation since the Sui Dynasty (581–618 A.D.), during which it was designated as the provincial capital of Hubei. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 A.D.), the city became a major port and was eventually designated as the capital of the Qing Dynasty in the 18th century.  Modern Wuhan, referred to as the “Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces”, became the commercial, political, and military hub of central China during the late 19th century. Wuhan developed rapidly after the Second World War and began to industrialize, becoming one of the four major cities in mainland China. In October 1984, Wuhan was designated as a sub provincial city and became the fourth municipality directly under the Central Government.  Though Wuhan is a much different city now than it was centuries ago, it remains a major center of transport and industry. In recent years, the city has become home to a number of high-tech industry parks, including the Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development Zone and the Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone.  More recently, Wuhan has been in the news for becoming the epicenter of the 2019-2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In January 2020, the Chinese government imposed a complete travel ban on the city, and the city remained under quarantine for over two months. As of June 2020, Wuhan had seen a total of 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, but less than 9,000 active cases and roughly 3,800 deaths. Despite this devastating epidemic, the city has since reopened and is slowly but surely returning to normal.']",
8,Global stocks pull back from the edge after historic sell-off,"['Global stocks have pulled back from the historic sell-off record that occurred in late March, on news that the US Senate had passed the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Investors were relieved to see the US government take a major step towards helping to support the economy amidst the outbreak.  The major US indices have seen a rebound since the lows of late March, as the S&P 500 has climbed 8% from its March 23rd low and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has risen 10%.   This rebound has been supported by encouraging economic data, with reports indicating that jobless claims decreased last week and that the economic contraction in the first quarter of the year was not as bad as expected.   However, this rebound has been fragile, as investors remain concerned about the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the stability of the financial system. The recent rebound could also be seen as a result of the increased liquidity provided by central banks, as they remain committed to prevent the global economic contraction from being more severe.   Overall, the global markets have pulled back from the historic lows of late March and the outlook remains uncertain. Investors are still cautious and many remain wary of the potential long-term impacts of the virus on businesses and the economy.  Global stock markets have pulled back from the edge after suffering their worst week in history. After suffering their biggest losses since the 2008 financial crisis, markets have regained some momentum. As of Monday, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices have climbed more than 8% from their intraday lows of last Friday. The DAX 30 has also recovered slightly, albeit still down 7.5% from its high last week.  The rally has been spurred by positive developments in the global fight against coronavirus. In the US, the Trump administration rolled out a $2 trillion stimulus package on Friday to help limit the economic damage of the outbreak. This package is likely to be followed by further efforts to cushion the blow of the global pandemic.   The European Central Bank (ECB) has also injected liquidity into the markets, by cutting interest rates and expanding its asset purchases program. This move has provided a further boost to global markets.   Despite the gains, the threat of a global recession still looms large. Many investors are cautioning against trying to pick a bottom in the markets, with equity strategist Jeffrey Halley at Oanda warning that the “800-point rally in the Dow over the past three days is more likely a dead-cat bounce than the start of a bull market”.   For now, investors will be watching closely for further developments that could either help or worsen the economic outlook. This could come from news about the progress of coronavirus, and future measures from governments and central banks to combat its economic impacts.']",
9,Chinese diplomat promotes conspiracy theory that US military brought virus to Wuhan,"['It is not clear who the Chinese diplomat is or what evidence they have to support this conspiracy theory. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied the allegations, and the United States has consistently rejected the idea that the virus originated from a US military delegation who visited Wuhan. The World Health Organization and leading experts in virology have confirmed the virus most likely emerged naturally from an animal source.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry does not support any conspiracy theories. The Chinese government has made it clear that it is willing and ready to work with other countries, including the United States, to investigate the origins of the virus. China firmly believes that science and epidemiological research should be based on facts and conducted in partnership with other countries. Conspiracy theories should be based on scientific evidence and transparent and responsible communication among different countries.  This conspiracy theory has no basis in fact and has been widely discredited. The World Health Organization and other international bodies, including the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have concluded that the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the US military or anyone else brought the virus to Wuhan.  The Chinese government has not officially endorsed any conspiracy theory linking the United States military to the spread of the novel coronavirus in China. However, a Chinese diplomat recently promoted the theory in a tweet. The tweet was later removed and the Chinese ambassador to South Africa apologized for the tweet. This conspiracy theory has been debunked as there is no evidence to support the claim that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan.']",
10,"Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump is struggling to keep up","['.  In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have used the crisis as an opportunity to further their control and extend their international influence. Putin has been pushing a nationalist agenda, highlighting the shortcomings of Western democracies and claiming that Russia is a leader in the medical and economic fields. Meanwhile, Xi has used his country’s initial containment of the outbreak to bolster his image as a strong leader, and has been aggressively publicizing China’s role in providing medical and economic assistance to other countries.  In comparison, US President Donald Trump has been struggling to keep up in the face of the crisis. While the US has been slow to address the outbreak and has failed to contain it successfully compared to other countries, Trump has sought to downplay the impact of the crisis and overly focused on his own re-election campaign. This has made it difficult for the US to maintain its traditionally strong international leadership role..  Putin and Xi are taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis to extend their control over their respective countries and beyond. As the disease continues to spread, these leaders are using the pandemic to gain power and influence by silencing domestic dissent, extending their influence in international affairs, and reaping the economic benefits of their government-led efforts to tackle the virus.  Meanwhile, President Donald Trump of the United States is struggling to keep apace. While the American economy and international relations is being damaged by the pandemic, Trump is largely absent from the international response, neglecting to form a coalition and provide global leadership. He has instead chosen to become embroiled in internal fights with Congress, the courts, and local governments, making it difficult for the US to have any significant impact in the coronavirus crisis.']",
11,How this South Korean company created coronavirus test kits in three weeks,"['South Korean diagnostics company, Seegene, worked closely with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to create a coronavirus test kit that would enable quick detection of the virus within three weeks. The test kit is called Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 and it can detect the virus in a single patient sample in as little as 15 minutes.  The company leveraged its proprietary Multiplex Amplification technology to allow for testing of multiple targets in a single testing process. The company also used its expertise in biochip technology to allow for rapid and accurate testing results.  To ensure the accuracy of the test kits, Seegene used the KCDC’s SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence as a reference. Furthermore, they compared and tracked the sensitivity and specificity of their tests against the KCDC and other international reference samples.  Seegene also provided prompt delivery of the test kits to the KCDC and various hospitals, along with necessary training and technical support to ensure efficient use of the kits. The kits were also made available to other countries in need, a testament to the company’s commitment to fighting the pandemic.  South Korean company SD Biosensor developed and launched coronavirus test kits in three weeks by combining their existing technology with new knowledge about the virus. They used a “real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction” test to quickly generate results and made sure that the test had a high sensitivity rate of 97.5%. They also used their existing supply chain and production lines in order to make the process more efficient and quick.']",

13,Coronavirus could hurt Boeing more than the 737 Max crisis,"['The coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis could be more damaging to Boeing than the 737 Max crisis. The company is facing a prolonged downturn in air travel, which is expected to have a major effect on aircraft orders, production, and employment. The company has already laid off some workers, and more could be on the way. The Boeing 737 Max had been grounded since March 2019, leading to a huge loss of orders and revenue. The 737 Max will eventually return to service, but the coronavirus has the potential to be more devastating to Boeing. It could take much longer for air travel to rebound and aircraft orders to return to previous levels, and the effects of the virus could be felt for years.  It is possible that the Coronavirus crisis could hurt Boeing more than the 737 Max crisis. The Coronavirus crisis is causing a global slowdown in air travel, with governments from all over the world implementing restrictions on travel and airlines reducing or suspending routes. This has had a major impact on the airline industry, with airlines suspending orders for new aircraft, deferring delivery of aircraft on order, returning leased aircraft early and cutting capacity. As a result, Boeing’s backlog of orders has decreased significantly, and there is uncertainty about the timing of any future orders. Boeing is also facing other costs associated with the Coronavirus crisis such as production disruption due to factory closures and decreased demand for parts and components. In the 737 Max crisis, while Boeing was facing significant reputational damage and heavy financial losses due to the grounding of its planes, the situation was somewhat contained and isolated to the airline industry. With the Coronavirus crisis, the impact on Boeing’s operations is much more wide-reaching, and the company may be facing an even greater financial burden than it did in the 737 Max crisis.']",
14,Hong Kong protests: How unrest criminalized a generation,"['The Hong Kong protests that began in June of 2019 have seen a generation of young Hong Kongers criminalized as the Hong Kong government has cracked down on protesters with increasingly severe punishments for those accused of offenses. The government has used harsh tactics to try and curb the protests, including a ban on face masks and new “anti-mask” laws that make wearing one a criminal offense, as well as introducing legislation that could see people extradited to mainland China and facing life in prison for peaceful protest activities.  Many of the young protesters, who are mostly students in their teens and twenties, face serious charges in court and are being prosecuted as adults, regardless of their age. This has led to concerns that the government is criminalizing an entire generation of Hong Kongers for peacefully exercising their right to protest.  The Hong Kong government has also been accused of using heavy-handed tactics to suppress the protests and the underlying movement for democracy, with police using tear gas, rubber bullets, and pepper spray to disperse protesters. Many protesters have been injured or killed and hundreds have been arrested and have faced lengthy prison sentences.  The impact on Hong Kong’s youth is far-reaching, with many protesters and bystanders facing psychological abuse, long-term trauma, and lasting financial and legal troubles. Families have been torn apart as parents try to keep their children safe, and some young protesters have been forced into exile.  The effects of the protests and the government’s response may have a lasting and damaging impact on the next generation of Hong Kongers, as they are increasingly criminalized, vilified, and punished for standing up against their government.']",
15,Christmas in Hong Kong marked by demonstrations and tear gas,"['Christmas in Hong Kong was marked by huge protests and clashes with police. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in some of the most intense protests seen in the city this year. The protests, which began in June in response to a controversial extradition bill, have since become an outpouring of public anger over Beijing’s encroachment on the semi-autonomous city.  Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds, and dozens of people were arrested. The protests have seen multiple injuries and even the death of a 22-year-old student.  The demonstrations come at a time of heightened tension and political upheaval in Hong Kong as the city’s long-time leader, Carrie Lam, is struggling to keep control over the freewheeling financial hub and maintain order after protests against her government have become increasingly violent.  Despite the unrest, many in the city are still trying to celebrate the holiday season. Many stores have gone all out with decorations (although much fewer compared to normal) and there have been some Christmas carol events to bring cheer to the city.  Christmas in Hong Kong was marked by mass demonstrations and the use of tear gas by police to disperse protesters. Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets of the city to express their opposition to the government and its pro-China policies. The police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters sought to march past barricades and occupy public spaces.  The protests, which began in June, have escalated in recent weeks as the government has moved forward with a controversial national security law and proposed changes to electoral rules that activists fear would further erode the city’s autonomy and rights.  The protests have shown no sign of letting up, despite the government’s attempts to clamp down on them. Many protesters were undeterred by the police’s use of force and the looming threat of a national security law. Some demonstrators held Christmas-themed signs and banners, and the mood was generally festive.  At the same time, the demonstrations underscored the deep divisions in the city. Supporters of the Hong Kong government and pro-Beijing groups held counter-protests throughout the city, as did more moderate citizens who wanted to make their voices heard without taking part in the protests.  The demonstrations on Christmas Day show that the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong is still strong. Although it may be difficult to predict what will happen in the coming months, it is clear that the protests are likely to continue into the new year.']",
16,New arts district aims to brighten Chennai community's dark reputation,"['A new arts district in the city of Chennai is aiming to brighten the city’s dark reputation and give locals and visitors access to a vibrant creative scene. Spanning more than 170 acres, the $50 million project features four distinct zones that are designed to bring together the performing, visual, cinematic and literary arts.  The project, which has been in the works for several years, is an effort to revitalize the city’s cultural landscape and attract more visitors from around the world. The four zones of the arts district will feature professional theaters, galleries, cinemas, museums and libraries, as well as performance and rehearsal spaces. The district will also have parks, cafes, retail stores and other amenities.  The team behind the project has worked to make sure the district appeals to both locals and tourists by ensuring it offers something for everyone. It is hoped that the district will be a welcome addition to the city and help to promote Chennai’s reputation as a place of cultural diversity and artistic expression.  The new arts district is just one of the many ways the city of Chennai is attempting to shed its negative public image and boost its appeal. With its new cultural offerings, Chennai is hoping to attract new visitors and make a name for itself as a destination for anyone looking for a creative and inspiring experience.  The Vyasarpadi area of Chennai, India, has a reputation for being an impoverished and crime-ridden area. In an effort to improve the area and its reputation, local entrepreneurs and the government are working together to establish a new arts district. This district will be centered around providing education and access to artistic endeavors for the local community. The project plans include a large multipurpose community center, studios for visual and performing arts, a park, and a restaurant. The government has already invested in infrastructure improvements, including the construction of roads, and will continue to help fund the project. In addition, private companies and individuals have contributed to the project as well.   The district aims to provide creative outlets and opportunities to people in the area, while also giving the area a much-needed boost in terms of positive public perception. With its new potential, the Vyasarpadi area has the chance to become a destination that is known for its art and culture, rather than its crime and poverty. In addition, it is hoped that the new district will provide local businesses with an economic boost, creating jobs and adding to the area's tax base. By investing in culture, the government and citizens are showing their commitment to the area and its people.   It is hoped that the Vyasarpadi arts district will help to bring new life to the area, and to ultimately change the public perception of Vyasarpadi as a dangerous and poverty-stricken place. Through the creative outlets and opportunities provided by the district, the people of Vyasarpadi can take pride in their community and its culture.']",
17,From east Paris to world fame -- how imagination and travel fueled Christian Louboutin's success,"['Christian Louboutin is a French fashion designer who rose to global fame, thanks to his innovative and stylish shoe designs. The story of his success begins in east Paris, where he grew up near the Eiffel Tower. As a young boy, he often visited the nearby theater district and was inspired by the colorful costumes and extravagant sets he saw.  This early fascination with glamour, theater, color, and travel would shape his future career. With an inherent appreciation for beauty, Louboutin began to imagine and design his own shoes. He was able to take his creative designs to the next level when he had the opportunity to travel and explore fashion destinations from the U.S. to Milan.  By combining his passion for travel and his innate knack for design, Louboutin developed a unique look for his shoes, which has landed him world-wide fame.

20,Mount Everest closed over coronavirus fears,"['In March 2020, officials in Nepal closed Mount Everest in response to the growing threat of coronavirus. The temporary closure of the world’s tallest mountain was meant to protect both mountaineers and locals from the spread of the disease. Since then, the mountain has been reopened with certain restrictions in place, such as mandating that all climbers have a medical certificate and proof of insurance. In order to protect the environment and wildlife in the area, the Nepalese government imposed an additional environmental fee on all climbers, as well as a ban on single-use plastics.  Due to the international travel restrictions imposed on countries affected by the novel coronavirus, Mount Everest was closed to visitors and climbers in late March 2020. The Nepalese government announced that all permits to climb the mountain would be suspended until further notice to protect both visitors and local residents. Access to base camps and other sites on the mountain has also been restricted.  At the request of the Nepalese government, Mount Everest and its surrounding areas have been closed to mountaineers due to the spread of the coronavirus. The order was issued on April 14th, 2020 in an announcement made by the Department of Tourism. The order will remain in effect until further notice. All climbers and trekkers in the area must leave immediately. There is no known timeline for when the area will be reopened.  Due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, the climbing season at Mount Everest has been officially closed until 2021. In March 2020, the Chinese and Nepali governments announced that all mountaineers would be banned from attempting to climb the world's highest peak until further notice. As of April 2020, all mountaineering activities in the Himalayan region have been suspended until 2021.

25,Why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses,"['The impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses due to the close living quarters of many students, the increased risk of students gathering in large groups, and the potential for students to travel and spread the virus while they are away from campus. Additionally, college campuses typically have many visitors and events throughout the year, which increases the potential for virus transmission. Furthermore, there may be a lack of resources or guidance to help student understand how to protect themselves and others from the virus.?  The impact of the coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses due to the high concentrations of people in a confined area. College campuses are often densely populated, with a high population density, and people often spend extended amounts of time in close proximity. This could create ideal conditions for the spread of the virus. Additionally, many campus activities and events involve large numbers of people coming together, which could potentially spread the virus quickly. Moreover, college campuses often have vulnerable populations, such as international students, which could be more likely to contract and spread the virus.  The impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses because of the high concentration of people, often from around the world, living and interacting in close quarters. Additionally, many of the activities that occur on college campuses, including large lectures, crowded dinners, parties, and other social activities, provide ideal conditions for the virus to spread quickly and further. College campuses are also often made up of a variety of vulnerable populations, such as those with chronic conditions, that may be more severely affected by the virus. As such, college campuses may be particularly susceptible to the spread of the virus, and the consequences could be critical.']",
26,Diplomat at the UN tests positive for coronavirus,"['If a diplomat at the UN tests positive for coronavirus, they will be provided with appropriate medical care. Depending on the country they are from, they may be asked to self-isolate or be placed under quarantine until they test negative and can return to their duties. The UN will also take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of all personnel, including contact tracing, testing, and providing information to the public.  If a diplomat at the United Nations (UN) has tested positive for coronavirus, it is likely that the UN would take a number of steps to prevent the spread of the virus. These could include:  1. Contact tracing: The UN would likely use contact tracing techniques to identify anyone who may have come into contact with the diplomat and alert them of their risk.   2. Quarantine: The UN may recommend that the diplomat and anyone they have been in contact with quarantine themselves to avoid the further spread of the virus.  3. Testing: All the diplomats who were in contact with the infected diplomat would likely be tested for coronavirus to identify any other possible cases.   4. Hygiene advice: In addition to contact tracing, the UN may also provide hygiene advice to those who have been in contact with the infected diplomat to help prevent further spread of the virus.   5. Cleaning: The UN may also take steps to ensure all areas where the infected diplomat has been are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.   6. Screening: The UN may also introduce screening measures for diplomats entering and leaving the building to ensure that no one with symptoms of coronavirus is able to enter the premises.']",
27,What the US can learn from Singapore's coronavirus strategy,"['1. Develop a National Task Force: The US can learn from Singapore's approach to crisis management by creating a National Task Force on pandemics and public health emergencies to respond more quickly and efficiently to potential health threats.  2. Embrace Contact Tracing: Singapore has embraced contact tracing as an integral part of its coronavirus response, enabling the country to better understand how and where the virus is spreading. The US should consider this approach as well, using tools such as digital contact tracing and comprehensive testing to identify and contain new cases.  3. Embrace Technology: Singapore has leveraged technology to help reduce the spread of the virus, such as facial recognition and other digital platforms to help monitor individuals’ movements and alert them to the status of their health. The US should explore using similar technology, such as contact tracing apps, to aid in their pandemic response.  4. Implement Social Distancing Strategies: Singapore has used effective social distancing strategies, such as promoting physical distancing in public places and closing schools, to help contain the virus. The US should employ similar tactics to help reduce community spread.  5. Speed Up Vaccine Development: Singapore is actively working to speed up the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, and the US should do the same. Both countries can collaborate to ensure a safe and effective vaccine is available quickly and to all those who need it.  1. Conduct Effective Contact Tracing: Singapore was able to quickly identify and quarantine individuals who came into contact with coronavirus patients in order to contain transmission. The US could benefit from investing in digital contact tracing applications, as well as expanding testing protocols and tracing procedures.  2. Utilize Advanced Technology: Singapore used a combination of technology and traditional contact tracing methods to identify potential cases. This included the use of sensors, data analytics, and predictive modeling to track potential carriers. The US could benefit from investing in similar systems and technologies.  3. Increase Testing and Quarantine Compliance: Singapore was highly successful in their testing and quarantine efforts, and their compliance rates were much higher than other countries. The US could benefit from taking similar measures to encourage people to get tested and comply with quarantine.  4. Create Holistic Strategies: Singapore took a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the pandemic, incorporating both health care and economic measures. This helped to ensure the smooth implementation of policies and minimized economic disruption. The US could benefit from developing similar, integrated strategies.']",

29,Angelina Jolie: What we must do for Afghan women,"['It is important to ensure that Afghan women are given the same rights and opportunities as men. This should include education and access to healthcare, employment, and political power. We should also ensure that all women have access to justice and the right to live free from violence and discrimination. Additionally, we should champion efforts to promote the value of girls’ education and provide resources to support those already in school. Finally, we should build strong relationships with Afghan women's organizations and include them in decisions about the country's future.  1. Provide basic education: Afghan women are largely denied the right to education, with only 30% of girls enrolled in school. They must be provided with opportunities to pursue formal education.  2. Increase economic opportunities: Economic opportunities are limited for Afghan women. There must be job training provided to equip them with the skills necessary to secure jobs in the workforce.  3. Improve healthcare services: Afghan women lack access to quality healthcare. They must be given access to healthcare services, as well as information about their health and rights.  4. Strengthen legal protection: Afghan women are subject to numerous forms of gender-based violence. It is essential that the legal system be strengthened to afford Afghan women greater protection from such violence.  5. Boost political participation: Afghan women are largely excluded from politics. This must be addressed by increasing their participation in decision-making roles and holding them accountable.  1. Protect Afghan Women’s Rights: Afghan women have been deprived of their basic rights since the Taliban took power in 1996. Achieving full gender equality for Afghan women is vital to fostering a peaceful and prosperous country. International actors must continue to press for reforms that guarantee Afghan women’s rights, including the right to work, inherit property and obtain an education.  2. Support Women’s Legal Protections: Afghan women still have few legal protections, and those they do are often not enforced. Laws must be enacted and enforced that protect women from domestic violence, child marriage, and other forms of gender-based violence. More female police and judicial officials must be recruited and trained to ensure justice is meted out equitably.  3. Provide Resources: To empower Afghan women, they must be provided with access to resources like education and job training. Projects that help increase women’s economic clout, such as agricultural enterprises or microfinance initiatives, should also be supported. Investing in women’s human capital will boost the local economy and help women achieve greater autonomy.  4. Encourage Female Political Participation: Afghan women must be supported to run for office, and voters must be educated on the importance of female representation. More female participation in politics can help ensure that women’s issues are addressed and that laws that protect women’s rights are passed.  5. Promote Women’s Health: Afghan women suffer from high rates of poor health, and diseases like HIV are often rampant. Health care initiatives must be implemented that provide women with access to health services, sex education, and reproductive health care. Programs should also be implemented to reduce maternal mortality and improve overall reproductive health outcomes.']",

Kate Beckinsale has shared a powerful response to the news of Harvey Weinstein’s prison sentence.  The British actress, who has alleged that she was sexually harassed by Weinstein, took to Instagram to share a picture of herself looking determined and fierce, alongside the caption “All we can do is keep fighting.”  Beckinsale’s response speaks to the fact that while Weinstein has now been convicted of rape and criminal sexual act, justice is far from won. This is particularly pertinent to her, as she was not one of his victims in the trial, as the incidents she alleges took place too long ago to be included in the criminal case.

It is a powerful statement from Beckinsale, and an inspiration to all who stand against sexual assault and hopes for justice to be served.  I applaud the brave people who came forward and faced their fears in pursuit of justice. It was never about one person, then, now or ever and I hope that today’s sentence brings some small measure of peace to those who have suffered.

52,'The Hunt' leverages the partisan divide as a hook to sell an exploitation throwback,"['The Hunt is a 2020 American horror thriller film directed by Craig Zobel, and written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof. It follows twelve strangers who are kidnapped and dropped in a forest, where they are hunted by wealthy elites for sport. The film has been criticized for leveraging the partisan divide as a hook to sell an exploitation throwback. However, its underlying themes of class and power dynamics, as well as the way it touches on topics such as white privilege and the abuse of power, suggest a deeper level of complexity. Ultimately, The Hunt serves as a sharp, often uncomfortable reminder that the right to hunt and be hunted is, unfortunately, not equal.  The Hunt, a 2020 horror-thriller, leverages the growing partisan divide in the United States to hook viewers while also playing into the classic exploitation movie genre. The film follows a group of ""liberals"" who are abducted and hunted in a rural forest by a group of ""conservatives"". This framing serves to create a sense of excitement and urgency and is used as a marketing tool to draw viewers in. The film also has many classic exploitation movie elements, including a focus on violence and shock-value, as well as a story that revolves around a group of people that have been ""othered"" by society. The film also plays on the idea of the ""ultimate hunter"" and draws on the primal fear of being tracked and hunted. By blending these elements together, The Hunt is able to use the current political climate to hook viewers while also delivering a classic exploitation experience.']",
53,Time's Up and others react to Harvey Weinstein sentence,"['Organizations that have fought against sexual misconduct and sexual assault, such as TIME'S UP, voiced their displeasure and disappointment with the 23-year sentence handed down to Harvey Weinstein.   TIME'S UP said the criminal justice system had failed the many women Weinstein had harmed, and that the “length of a sentence doesn’t equate to justice”.  “For the women who testified in this case, and walked through traumatic hell, you did a public service to women everywhere, thank you,” said the statement.  Other victims advocacy groups similarly condemned the justice system and said the sentence did not reflect the gravity of Weinstein’s crimes. Representatives from RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence said the judge’s decision sends a message to survivors of sexual violence that their experiences do not matter and that perpetrators will not be held accountable.  The statement from TIME'S UP also called for legal reform, saying nothing will change until lawmakers pass legislation to address issues like statutes of limitations on sexual assault, an end to the use of non-disclosure agreements that silence survivors and other measures to protect victims.  Time's Up, an organization devoted to fighting sexual harassment and assault in workplaces, has issued a statement expressing its disappointment with the prison sentence handed down to former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.   ""We can never underestimate the profound ripple effect that survivors of sexual violence can cause,"" the statement reads. ""Today’s sentence does not reflect the seriousness of Weinstein’s crimes, nor does it communicate the message that such abusive behavior will no longer be tolerated.   ""But the time for reckoning is not over. Time’s Up will continue to push for meaningful and lasting change, so that the lives and livelihoods of all people are not threatened by those in positions of power. We will not rest until we get it.""  Other organizations, such as GLAAD, the National Organization for Women, and RAINN, have also criticized the sentence, branding it a “slap on the wrist” and noting that it does not send a strong enough message about the need for accountability for perpetrators of sexual violence.']",

The movie debuted at the American Film Institute Festival in November 2019 and was released in theaters and on Apple TV+ in March 2020. It has earned $4.8 million in total revenue after expenses. While the film was by no means a box office hit, it has earned back A-list respectability for Apple's film ambitions. Ultimately 'The Banker' has provided a solid opening for Apple to dive further into the world of film-making.  Apple's first foray into movie production via its film financing arm, The Banker, is expected to yield a modest return. The movie, which is Apple's first ever feature film, has already made back its production budget of $23 million. It is estimated that Apple will be able to recoup its marketing costs, for a total of about $45 million in total. This is a far cry from the $100 million to $200 million budgets of some of its biggest competitors. Apple is said to be confident in the film's limited theatrical release, with the film being released on the Apple TV+ streaming service afterwards.  Apple's foray into the world of cinematic storytelling has so far been highly modest. The technology giant released ""The Banker,"" a biopic starring Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie, earlier this year to mixed reviews.

61,"Al Pacino hunts Nazis in 'Hunters,' a series whose premise tops its execution","['Though the idea of 'Hunters' is intriguing, with its focus on Pacino's character and his mission to hunt down escaped Nazi war criminals, its execution does not quite support the premise. The series has numerous plot points that can feel contrived and it often relies on sensationalized shock value to tell the story. Despite its promise, 'Hunters' fails to deliver the layered and complex narrative that was promised.  Al Pacino stars in Amazon's new series Hunters, a story about a diverse group of Nazi hunters living in 1977 New York City. While the premise of the series is intriguing and exciting, unfortunately, the execution falls short. The show has some interesting plot points and moments, but ultimately it does not live up to the hype. The dialogue is often clunky and characters lack depth. Plus, the show's pacing is slow and plodding, making it difficult to become deeply invested in the story. Despite some entertaining moments, Hunters is ultimately a disappointing series and fails to deliver the engaging Nazi-hunting adventure that it could have been.  Based on reviews by critics, the series Hunters starring Al Pacino has not been very well received. The series has been criticized for having a great premise but not translating that into a great execution. Critics have also noted that the show is predictable and too focused on dialogue. Additionally, the show has been criticized for its lack of subtlety and characterization. Ultimately, Hunters does not live up to its potential and fails to deliver a satisfying viewing experience.']",

64,"The Fastest Way To Pay Off $10,000 In Credit Card Debt","['The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt is to make more than the minimum payments and focus on reducing the most expensive debt first, such as those with the highest interest rates. Prioritize this debt and make slightly larger payments than the minimum required. Additionally, creating a budget and reducing spending can help to put more money towards the debt each month. It is also important to avoid taking out additional credit, as it will only add more debt to the total.  1. Stop Adding More Credit Card Debt – The first step is to stop adding to your existing credit card debt and to put an end to any practices that may have led to its accumulation.  2. Make a Budget – It is important to create a budget that takes into account your current debt load as well as future expenses. This will help you to identify areas where you can make cuts or increase your income.  3. Make Larger Payments – Making larger payments on your credit card debt is the quickest way to pay it off. This can be done by making the minimum payment on all of your cards, then putting the rest of the money towards your highest interest rate card.  4. Make Biweekly Payments – Another great way to pay off your debt quickly is to make biweekly payments instead of a single monthly payment. This will help reduce the interest that accrues on your debt as well as help you to pay it off faster.  5. Consider Debt Consolidation – You may want to consider a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer card to help lower your interest rates and pay off your debt faster.  6. Ask Your Creditors for Help – Sometimes creditors are willing to work out a better deal with you, such as a lower interest rate or a payment plan. Don't be afraid to ask, if you can get a better deal it could save you a lot of money in the long run.']",

78,India has an increasingly global perspective on beauty -- but the patriarchy still looms large,"['India has made notable strides in terms of its global perspective on beauty in recent years. From celebrating traditional beauty practices to embracing modern ones, India is no longer confined to just celebrating a single type of beauty. There is growing acceptance of diverse looks, skin tones, and body sizes. This is exemplified in Bollywood, where a recent trend of including unconventional actors in leading roles has highlighted the importance of embracing different body types and skin tones.  Despite these progressive changes, the patriarchy still looms large in India's beauty culture. Women are still judged largely on their physical appearance, while traditional beauty ideals are still seen as more desirable. Additionally, gender roles and expectations are still enforced through beauty standards, dictating what is socially acceptable for each gender. As such, there is a need for further reform in terms of gender equality and inclusivity in India's beauty culture to ensure that all genders feel empowered to express themselves without judgment or fear.  India has a diverse range of beauty standards that have been influenced by global trends. However, traditional patriarchal norms are still deeply entrenched in Indian society. Women are increasingly being presented as sexualized objects in advertising and other media, while men are still routinely positioned as being superior in society. Indian women are often expected to fit into traditional notions of beauty and conform to restrictive gender roles. This has led to the perpetuation of rigid standards of beauty that often fail to represent the full range of body types, ethnicities, and genders present in India. Additionally, women are often disproportionately judged for their appearance and pushed to conform to outdated beauty standards.']",

The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also urged for peace and calm in the city.

Since the early days of the internet, companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, have enjoyed strong business ties with the country. This changed in early 2020, when both the government and the public began to express dissatisfaction over the companies’ alleged anti-competitive practices. These criticisms led to the Indian government launching an investigation into the companies and initiating measures to regulate them. To add to this, the companies have been accused of violating the data privacy rights of Indian citizens and using the data of its citizens without their consent. This has led to a major backlash against Big Tech, with the government and citizens alike expressing dissatisfaction with the companies. As a result, the companies have been subject to heightened scrutiny and regulation in India, leading to a decrease in their influence in the Indian market..  Big Tech's relationship with China has always been a difficult and complex one. While companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple have been able to enter the Chinese market to some degree, the Chinese government has taken a hard line on censorship and control over the internet, making it difficult for many of these companies to continue to operate in the country. In recent weeks, tensions have escalated further, with the Chinese government banning many of the services used by these Big Tech companies, such as Google's search engine and YouTube, as part of its efforts to suppress dissent. This has caused many of these companies to scale back their presence in China, or abandon it altogether. For example, Google has closed its office in China and shifted its focus to other markets. As the US-China tensions continue to escalate, many of these companies are unlikely to have a successful presence in China in the near future.']",

89,Why India's citizenship law crosses the line,"['India's recent Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was passed on December 11th, 2019, has caused a nationwide uproar due to its perceived discriminatory nature. The act was passed to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, while effectively excluding Muslim immigrants. This has sparked protests throughout India as well as criticism from domestic and international organizations.  The act's language creates a distinction between non-Muslim and Muslim immigrants and violates the secular nature of India's Constitution. India's founding document guarantees all citizens, including immigrants, the same rights regardless of their faith. The CAA also violates internationally accepted principles of non-discrimination as it grants preferential treatment to non-Muslims.  The act has been widely condemned as it discriminates against minorities and goes against the right to equality that is guaranteed to all under India's Constitution and international laws. The CAA has also been seen as part of an effort to marginalize and exclude the Muslim community in India, which has prompted worries that it could lead to further social and religious tensions in the country. For these reasons, many have argued that the CAA crosses a line and should be immediately rescinded. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/why-indias-citizenship-law-crosses-the-line/2019/11/30/d264687c-11da-11ea-80d3-63ace636af08_story.html  India’s new citizenship law has sparked protests and unrest across the country because it discriminates against Muslims and violates the country’s constitution. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of 2019 has amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 to make it easier for people from certain religious backgrounds to become citizens of India. The CAA specifically excludes Muslims, making it unconstitutional and violating international law as discrimination based on religion is prohibited.  The law has also been criticized for its potential to create an unequal two-tiered system of citizenship. It allows expedited citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who have been living illegally in India from Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan. The CAA does not grant the same opportunities to Muslims from the same countries, violating the constitutional principle of secularism and equality.  The law has been widely condemned for perpetuating a climate of fear and exclusion for India’s Muslim population and for setting a dangerous precedent for other countries to follow. It has also been criticized for not taking into account the complexity of India’s cultural and religious diversity. India has long been a multi-religious country and the CAA undermines the unity of its citizens by privileging one religion over another.  The law is also in direct contradiction to India’s international human rights obligations and is a violation of fundamental principles of human rights. The law raises serious questions regarding India’s commitment to minority rights and religious freedom.  The CAA is a clear violation of India’s international obligations and it is an affront to the spirit of Indian secularism. It undermines trust in Indian democracy and the rule of law and threatens to destabilize the country’s delicate social fabric. The law must be urgently revised to ensure that it complies with India’s constitutional principle of equality, minority rights and international human rights obligations.']",
90,India: The world leader in Internet shutdowns,"['India has the dubious distinction of being the world leader in internet shutdowns. Since 2012, there have been more than 200 instances of internet blackouts in the country. This has been done on the pretext of maintaining public order, preventing the spread of misinformation, or to quell protests. It has become a tool of suppression and censorship by the Indian government and has been criticized by activists and rights organizations. In response, multiple judicial bodies have determined that the government must provide a justification before it can institute such a blackout, but this has not stopped the practice.  India is currently the global leader in internet shutdowns, according to a report released by Access Now, a global digital rights organization. Between January 2012 and May 2020, the country has seen 196 internet shutdown incidents. India has imposed more shutdowns than any other country in the world in order to restrict access to the internet for political, social, or security reasons. This includes those imposed in response to communal violence, to quell dissent, or to prevent the spread of false or malicious content. The report states that this trend has increased over time, resulting in economic losses, limitations to the right to freedom of expression, and other human rights violations.  In 2020, India was the world leader in Internet shutdowns, with at least 164 shutdowns reported across the country. India has the dubious distinction of being the world’s leading offender when it comes to internet shutdowns, with a total of 4,196 hours of shutdowns reported in 2020. The Indian government has imposed these shutdowns for a variety of reasons, ranging from controlling communal violence to preventing cheating on exams. Human rights advocates have criticized the government for denying citizens their right to access the internet, which has become increasingly essential for accessing information and services. As the world undergoes a push for increased digital access, India’s excessive and frequent shutdowns of the internet continue to be a major roadblock in achieving a truly connected world.']",

95,A coronavirus outbreak could be devastating for poorer countries,"['. These countries are already suffering from a lack of healthcare resources and poverty, and an outbreak of the virus would place a further strain on the already limited resources. In addition, many poorer countries lack the infrastructure needed to prevent and manage an outbreak, making it more difficult to contain the virus. Furthermore, people in poorer countries may not have access to preventative measures such as hand sanitizer or face masks, or have the financial means to self-isolate if necessary. This could make it difficult for poorer countries to protect their citizens from an outbreak and could lead to an increase in fatalities.  The economic and public health impacts of a coronavirus outbreak in poorer countries could be devastating. Countries with weaker healthcare systems and lower incomes have less capacity to contain and respond to the virus. Poor healthcare systems, limited access to testing and treatment, and crowded living conditions could lead to higher mortality rates and more severe outbreaks among those who are already vulnerable. This could lead to a further weakening of local economies and exacerbation of poverty and inequality., as they may lack the resources and infrastructure to adequately respond to an outbreak. Poorer countries may not have the systems in place to track potential cases, provide adequate testing and contact tracing, or provide effective healthcare to those impacted by the virus. Furthermore, poorer countries may not have the funding to purchase enough supplies, such as masks and ventilators, to treat victims of the virus. Finally, poorer countries may have less access to information about the virus, which could make it more difficult to raise awareness and effectively prevent its spread.']",

Scientists have developed a process for producing synthetic venom, which is often identical to naturally produced venom. The synthetic venom contains the same proteins as natural venom, and works just as effectively as its natural counterpart. This has the potential to provide an easily accessible source of venom used in the medical field for therapeutic treatments (i.e. antivenom) as well as potential drug development. This could be especially valuable as certain snake species are becoming more vulnerable due to environmental degradation. With this new technology, scientists are able to create a consistent and reliable supply of venom that could be used to save many lives and protect populations of vulnerable species.. The venom can be used as a treatment for a wide range of health conditions and diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. It can also be used to treat pain and inflammation, and potentially as an antidote for dangerous snakebites. Researchers are exploring how the venom could be used to fight the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, as well as other potential medical applications. Making synthetic venom could also reduce the need to capture and harvest or kill venomous snakes in the wild, which is dramatically reducing their populations in some parts of the world.. It can be used for medical purposes, such as creating anti-venom to treat snakebite victims, or even in creating drugs to treat various medical conditions. It can also be used to create medical devices that use snake venom to detect certain diseases or to help regulate certain bodily functions. As technology continues to advance, researchers may be able to find new and innovative uses of lab-made snake venom.']",

98,Will warmer weather help fight the coronavirus? Singapore and Australia suggest maybe not,"['Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that warmer weather is unlikely to significantly reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Studies in Singapore, Australia and other countries have shown that the virus can spread and survive in temperatures up to 40°C (104°F). In addition, transmission of the virus is still possible in warm and humid weather as long as people are in close contact with each other. Prevention remains the key to reducing the spread of the virus and this means avoiding large gatherings, washing hands, wearing masks, and adhering to any local guidelines.  No, warmer weather alone is not enough to fight the coronavirus. While some countries in the northern hemisphere are seeing a flattening of cases as temperatures rise, there is no conclusive evidence that warmer weather can eradicate the virus. In fact, Singapore and Australia both saw a spike in new cases as temperatures began to rise. This suggests that warmer weather may not be as effective at combating the virus as originally thought. The best way to fight the coronavirus is still social distancing, good hygiene practices, and taking other precautionary measures such as wearing a face mask when out in public.  At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that warmer weather can help to fight the coronavirus. Singapore and Australia have seen higher coronavirus cases and deaths as the temperature has risen. Many scientists believe that the virus will spread similarly regardless of weather conditions.

108,This tiny lion with teeth like bolt-cutters once roamed Australia,"['.  The Thylacoleo carnifex, or ""marsupial lion,"" was a mammal that once roamed Australia. It was only about the size of a domestic cat, but had a massive jaw with incredibly strong teeth—so strong that it could cut through a kangaroo's bones, like bolt-cutters. It is believed to have become extinct about 40,000 years ago.  The marsupial lion (Thylacoleo carnifex) was an extinct carnivorous marsupial that lived during the late Pleistocene (around 100,000 to 40,000 years ago) in Australia. It had very strong jaws which allowed it to crunch through bones of the large prey it hunted. Its teeth were said to be like ""bolt-cutters"" and it was believed to have been the top predator in Australia during its time., but is now extinct.  The thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a species of carnivorous marsupial that once roamed Australia. It was the largest marsupial carnivore and had teeth that were noted to be similar to bolt-cutters. Unfortunately, the species went extinct in 1936 due to a combination of hunting and habitat loss.  The Thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger, is an extinct species of marsupial which once roamed Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. It was the apex predator of its environment, with its powerful jaws, sharp claws and a set of sharp teeth that could cut through metal bolts. It was hunted to extinction by European settlers in the early 20th century..  The thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. The species is now believed to be extinct, but was once found across Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. The thylacine had a body length of up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) and weighed up to 30 kg (66 lb). Its yellowish-brown coat featured 13 to 21 faint dark stripes, which extended from the shoulders and down the back to the tail. Its powerful jaws and sharp teeth, which could open up to 80 mm (3.1 in), gave it the nickname ""the Tasmanian tiger"" and ""the Tasmanian wolf"".']",
109,Baboons break out of captivity and go on the run near Sydney hospital,"['According to local media reports, two baboons broke out of their enclosure at an animal sanctuary near Sydney, Australia in April of 2019. One was captured shortly thereafter and the other was sighted near the grounds of a nearby hospital. Animal carers and workers from the sanctuary believe the baboons escaped through a hole made when a tree branch fell on the enclosure. The baboon that escaped was eventually captured without incident and moved to another sanctuary.  While this is possible, it is highly unlikely. Baboons are not native to Australia and therefore, would not typically be found in the wild or roaming around near a hospital in Sydney. Additionally, due to stringent animal control laws and regulations, it is unlikely that a baboon would break out of captivity and go on the run. It is possible, however, that a baboon has escaped from captivity, but this would be a rare occurrence.  This is a hypothetical situation as baboons are not native to Australia. However, if such a situation arose, it would be a major security incident and would require a rapid response from rescuers and authorities. The main concern would be for the safety of the baboons, as well as any persons or property that could be put in danger by their presence. Captive baboons are known to be quite aggressive, so any persons attempting to rescue them would need to exercise extreme caution. Authorities would also need to ensure that no members of the public came into contact with the baboons and that any potential escape routes were blocked off and the animals contained as soon as possible.']",

From the deadly virus itself, to the responses from governments and citizens, the virus has affected nearly every aspect of life. As the virus has spread, there have been some stories that are both surprising and heartbreaking.  In Canada, tons of live lobsters were stranded at an airport after orders from restaurants and seafood distributors were canceled due to the virus. In the United States, brides-to-be have had to scramble to find new dresses after shops went out of business or shut down due to the pandemic. These are just two examples of how the virus has disrupted the lives of people, businesses, and entire communities around the world.   The virus has also taken a significant economic toll as businesses and governments struggle to cope with the disruption. In addition to the obvious costs associated with lost sales, business closures, and declining production, the virus has had a wide range of ripple effects, from reduced tourism to increased costs for healthcare supplies.   The spread of the virus has also had a significant impact on international relations. Nations are struggling to cope with the new reality and contain their outbreaks, but divisions are deepening between those that were better prepared for the crisis and those that were caught off guard.   The virus has had widespread and far-reaching implications in every corner of the globe, and it continues to pose a serious challenge.

114,How tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England,"['Tattoos have a long and colorful history all over the world, and in the 19th century, they experienced a revival in Victorian England. Tattoos had been popular among sailors, who usually got them in Jameson’s parlour at the docks in London and elsewhere around the country. This gave the tattoos a certain level of notoriety, as did the fact that criminal gangs and military personnel both used to get tattoos.   With the growth of British imperialism in the 19th century, more and more British soldiers were getting tattoos in Asia and other parts of the world. This exposure to tattoos seems to have sparked off a fashion for tattoos among the upper classes in Victorian England, as people began to associate tattoos with adventure, courage, and strength. This was helped along by some famous people who were known for their tattoos, such as King Edward VII, who had a dragon and a lion tattooed on his arm.   It was also seen as a sign of wealth, as the equipment for tattooing was expensive and the process was relatively costly due to its intricate nature. As a result, many wealthy people began to get tattoos in order to display their status. By the end of the 19th century, tattoos had become more accepted in Victorian England and as a result, it had become fashionable.  Tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England in the late nineteen-century, due to increased levels of immigration and travel. Sailors who had been to exotic places such as the South Pacific, India and Egypt came back to England with tattoos on their bodies and this sparked a wave of interest in them. At the time, tattoos were seen as a way of decorating the body and a way to show off one's achievements.  The rise in interest in tattoos in the Victorian era was also influenced by the Royal Navy. At the time, the Royal Navy had a strict policy on tattoos for its sailors. Men were allowed to have tattooing done but only for specific reasons, such as commemorating a special occasion or event, or to signify membership of a particular club or society. This encouraged a certain kind of decorum around tattoos, which helped them become more acceptable to the general public.  In the late nineteenth century, tattoo parlours began to appear across England. These parlours were frequented by members of the Royal Navy, workers and the upper classes alike. As tattoos became more commonplace, they were seen as fashionable and a way of expressing oneself. This led to an increased level of acceptance of tattoos in Victorian England and allowed them to become commonplace in society.']",

117,Petition to airlines: Kids should sit with their parents,"['We, the undersigned, urge airlines to make it a priority that children always have the option to sit with their parents during domestic and international flights. For many parents, the thought of their children not being close to them on a flight can be a source of stress and anxiety. By allowing families to sit together, airlines can help ease these worries. Additionally, it will foster feelings of safety and security for the children. Furthermore, it can help create a pleasant travel experience for the whole family. Thank you for your attention to this important issue.  We, the undersigned, urge airlines to ensure that young children can sit with their parents on flights. Flying can be a scary and intimidating experience for young children, and it is important that they have the support of their parents throughout the journey. Having children sit with their parents gives parents the ability to provide comfort and safety to their children during the journey, and allows them to ensure that the children behave properly. In addition, it allows parents to keep a closer eye on young children, to make sure they remain hydrated and well-fed during the flight. Therefore, we call on airlines to make sure that young children can always sit with their parents on flights.  We, the undersigned, urge airlines to prioritize seating for children and their parents.   As parents, we understand the importance of being able to accompany our children on flights. Flying is a stressful experience for children, and having their parents by their side can make a tremendous difference in their experience.   In addition, seating children and their parents together can reduce the stress of flight staff and other passengers, who can easily become frustrated when separated families try to manage seating arrangements.

Additionally, some restaurant owners have noted that customers have canceled orders, and are asking for home deliveries instead.  In recent weeks, Chinese restaurants around the world have noticed a sharp decrease in business due to fears over the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). With more and more people avoiding crowded places, large gatherings and public transportation, Chinese restaurants are feeling the impact. In many cases, restaurant owners are reporting a 50-70% decrease in sales. For many, this can spell disaster.  Restaurant owners are responding by providing alternative ways to purchase their food, such as delivery and takeout. They are also offering discounts and promotions to encourage customers to visit. In some cases, restaurants are even creating online stores and mobile apps to make ordering even easier.   In the end, it will be up to restaurants to find creative ways to stay afloat during this difficult time. Many are also looking to local government for assistance, such as low-interest loans and other forms of financial aid.

121,Fan says she was told to remove rainbow flag during Israel Folau's debut match,"['If that's the case, then it's completely unacceptable. We live in a world where people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and religions should be accepted and respected, and it's insulting to ask someone to remove a symbol of acceptance and support for the LGBT community. No one should be asked to remove themselves or their symbols of support in a public setting, and if this fan was asked to do so, it's wrong and must be addressed.  If the fan was indeed told to remove her rainbow flag from the stands during Israel Folau's debut match, then it is understandable why she would feel disrespected and discriminated against. Rainbow flags have been adopted as a symbol of inclusivity, acceptance and support for LGBTQ people, and having it removed in this context could be interpreted as a sign of disdain for the LGBTQ community. In such a situation, the fan in question should take her complaint to the appropriate authorities and ask for an explanation as to why the flag was removed. If the authorities cannot provide a satisfactory answer, then the fan should consider taking the matter further and seeking legal advice.  The fan in question has not confirmed this report. If they have, they should report the incident to the appropriate authorities. Regardless, it is concerning that some venues and events may have rules prohibiting the display of rainbow flags in support of the LGBTQ+ community.

The inquiry Holmes and other campaigners are calling for is to investigate the serious complications linked to mesh implants, which have included chronic pain, disability, and long-term psychological and physical distress. She is also calling for better care and support for those who have suffered adverse reactions due to such implants, as well as better regulation to ensure the safety of women who may choose to have the procedure in the future.   In addition to the inquiry, Holmes has called for medical practitioners to take more responsibility for the effects of the implants on patients. She believes that medical professionals should be more accountable for their actions, and that the safety of implants should be paramount, rather than saving money and time when performing such procedures.   The fight against vaginal mesh implants is a long and complicated one, and Holmes' victory should be celebrated. However, more needs to be done to ensure the safety of women going forward, and a thorough and independent inquiry should be conducted.

Scottish campaigner Olive McIlroy has been given the go-ahead to take legal action against the manufacturers of the devices: Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon.  McIlroy, who has been living with chronic pain for more than two decades, is looking for damages for her suffering. Her case was backed by law firm Leigh Day, who believe the manufacturers of the implant have a case to answer.  Speaking to the press, McIlroy said: “This is a real victory for all women with this mesh implant. I am pleased and relieved that the judge has decided to allow my case to proceed and I will now take the fight forward to ensure that those responsible are held to account.  “The fight is not over and I hope that other women who are in similar situations will now feel empowered to seek justice.”  McIlroy’s case is being seen as a test case, with other claimants from the UK, US, Ireland and Australia backing her legal action. It is thought that thousands of women are affected by the implants, with concerns over their use first raised in 1999.']",

125,Lewis the koala's death is a sad end to a terrible tale,"['. He was rescued from a tree in an Australian backyard in 2017, but was attacked by a dog and had to be euthanized due to the extent of his injuries. His death has sparked outrage and sorrow from animal welfare groups, with many urging pet owners to take more responsibility for their animals. Koalas are increasingly threatened, with habitat destruction and human–animal interactions leading to a dramatic decline in koala numbers across Australia. Lewis’s death is a stark reminder of the need to protect these animals and to provide them with a safe and secure habitat.. He had been living on the edge of a small suburban neighborhood for nearly a decade, struggling for food and shelter and subject to constant harassment. For months, he had been poor and weak, living on a diet of trash and scraps and on the brink of starvation. Recently, a kind resident noticed his plight and brought him food and water, but it was too late and he eventually succumbed to the elements.  The death of Lewis the koala is a tragic reminder of the difficulties many wild animals face in suburban areas, where they struggle to survive in an environment that is not their natural habitat. It also highlights the important role individuals can play in making a difference and helping protect these animals. We can all do our part to reduce habitat destruction, provide food and water to wildlife, and discourage harassment of wild animals. of animal abuse. Lewis was a koala who had been living at a sanctuary in Victoria, Australia, since he was just a joey. He had been living in a large enclosure with other koalas, including two females, and was taken to a vet for regular check-ups. Sadly, he was found to be very sick and was euthanised in early 2021.  Despite his deteriorating health, Lewis was treated with dignity and was surrounded by caretakers and other koalas during his last days. His death has brought attention to the plight of koalas in Australia and the need for more support for their preservation.  Lewis' death also highlights the need for better animal welfare laws and stricter enforcement of them. Koalas are vulnerable species, and their numbers are declining in the wild due to habitat loss and overhunting. This recent incident of animal abuse and neglect should be a wake-up call for us all. We must take action to ensure animal welfare laws are properly enforced and that the koala population is protected.']",
126,Australia's Gladys Liu scandal shows how the Chinese Communist Party is weaponizing race,"['The controversy surrounding Australian MP Gladys Liu is evidence of how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is weaponizing race to increase its power and influence in Australia and other countries. Liu was accused of being a covert agent for the CCP after it emerged that she had close ties to Chinese government-linked organisations. The revelations caused a major scandal in Australia and led to calls for her resignation. The CCP has been reportedly using race to stifle criticism of its policies in Australia, with Chinese-Australians being singled out and labeled ‘anti-China’ if they speak out against the CCP’s human rights abuses. This tactic has been employed in other countries as well, with the CCP attempting to silence its critics by smearing them as anti-Chinese agents and accusing them of engaging in racial politics. The Gladys Liu scandal is a stark reminder of the CCP’s willingness to weaponize race to advance its own agenda.  The scandal involving Australia’s first ethnic Chinese female Member of Parliament, Gladys Liu, and allegations of ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) shows how the CCP is increasingly weaponizing race and ethnicity to further its geopolitical agenda.  The CCP has a long track record of using ethics and race to influence overseas public opinion and politics. This began with the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, where the CCP used its control of the narrative to characterize the protests as a “counter-revolutionary riot” and demonize the protesters as “hooligans.”  At the same time, the CCP encouraged overseas Chinese to identify their ethnicity with the government in Beijing and demonize pro-democracy activists as “anti-China.” The strategy has been used more recently in Hong Kong, where the police and pro-Beijing politicians have sought to delegitimize the pro-democracy movement by branding it “anti-Chinese” and “foreign-backed.”  The Gladys Liu scandal is a prime example of how the CCP is weaponizing race to further its own agenda. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has sought to use Liu’s political position to discredit and deflect criticism of the CCP’s human rights abuses and its increasingly authoritarian rule.  The controversy has also opened up a broader question of racial loyalty and identity. Chinese citizens living in democracies abroad must grapple with which nation or party to identify with; the CCP or their new homeland. The scandal also underscores the need for Western countries to remain vigilant in protecting their democratic systems against foreign interference.']",
127,The extinction crisis is far worse than you think,"['. The world is facing an unparalleled loss of biodiversity, with an estimated one million species threatened with extinction in the near future. The current extinction rate is 100 to 1,000 times higher than it was before humans, and human activities are driving this loss. Deforestation, urban development, pollution, and climate change are all major drivers of species loss, with habitat destruction playing a key role. Humans have also caused the introduction of new species, the introduction of invasive species, and the overutilization of resources. These factors, coupled with poaching, have all caused a rapid decline in the global population of many species.  The magnitude of the extinction crisis is so great that it can have dire consequences for human society, including a decrease in the availability of natural resources, an increase in disease transmission, and decreased efforts toward conservation. The environment and humanity are connected in many ways, and the implications of species loss affect us all. That’s why it’s so important to take action now to protect biodiversity and reduce the extinction crisis. This includes establishing a regulatory framework to mitigate the impacts of human activities, increasing funding for conservation and research, and fostering a culture of biodiversity conservation and appreciation.. It refers to the growing rate of species extinction, which is occurring at a rate 1,000 times faster than the natural background rate. This phenomenon is considered to be one of the most serious biodiversity crises in the history of the planet. It is estimated that over 100 species are currently becoming extinct every day. This crisis is being caused by many factors, including habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and the spread of invasive species. Unless drastic measures are taken to protect and conserve habitats, many species are in danger of disappearing altogether.']",
128,'We are failing the elephants',"['The world's elephant populations have decreased drastically in recent years due to poaching and habitat loss. This is a devastating trend that needs to be addressed urgently. To do this, we must make sure that governments, corporations, and individuals are doing their part to combat poaching, ensure land protection, and create sustainable eco-tourism. We must also raise awareness of the plight of elephants and push for better enforcement of laws. In order to make a positive change, we must take concrete steps now to protect the remaining elephant populations and their habitats.  Elephants are facing unprecedented threats due to human activity, such as habitat loss and poaching. Rapid population growth and growing demand for resources are putting elephants in danger. Elephants are being killed for their tusks, and their populations have drastically declined in many areas. Habitat destruction has drastically reduced their range and access to food and water. We are failing to protect elephants and the crucial role they play in our ecosystems. We must find effective ways to increase protection for elephants and protect their natural habitats.  The human-elephant conflict is one of the most pressing issues facing elephants and their survival. Every year, elephants are killed or injured by humans to protect agricultural land and crops, or in retaliation for raiding villages. In addition, the illegal ivory trade continues to drive poaching and threatens elephant populations. As a result, elephant habitats are shrinking, leaving less space for the elephants to roam, and making it difficult for them to find food and water. The increasing population of humans is also fragmenting elephant habitats and leading to the humanization of wild elephants. Further, climate change is making it more difficult for elephants to find food and water, and making their habitat less suitable for them. Therefore, it is clear that humans are failing the elephants in many ways, and urgent action is needed to protect these majestic creatures.']",
129,Imagine a world without giraffes,"['A world without giraffes would be a drastically different place. They are iconic animals, known for their long necks, spotted coats, and unique behavior. Without giraffes, grasslands and savannas across Africa wouldn't be the same. Other animals that rely on giraffes for food, such as several species of birds, would also suffer without the presence of these animals. The connections between the different species that inhabit these habitats would be drastically altered and this could lead to long-term damage to the environment.  A world without giraffes would be drastically different. Without such an iconic symbol of Africa, the world would lose a great source of biodiversity. African savanna landscapes would look extremely different. The food webs of this ecosystem would be completely disrupted as the giraffe is both a predator, feeding on acacia leaves, and a prey item, commonly eaten by lions and hyenas. Not to mention, giraffes are the world's tallest mammal, adding a unique and beautiful element to the African savannah. The world would be lesser without its gentle giants.  If the world were without giraffes, it would be a much different place. Giraffes are an iconic species with a deep symbolism in many cultures, and their loss would be felt in more ways than simply the disappearance of their iconic spotted coats. Without giraffes, the African savannah would be a much less diverse and dynamic place with fewer large browsers to maintain its delicate balance of grasses and trees. Additionally, in some parts of Africa, giraffe-based tourism can bring in much needed revenue to local communities, and this too would be lost. Finally, with the loss of such a beloved species comes the opportunity to appreciate other aspects of the natural world, even if it means that the world would never be quite the same without them.']",
130,Listening for the amphibian apocalypse,"['The amphibian apocalypse is a term used to describe the ongoing rapid decline of amphibian populations due to habitat destruction, climate change, introduced species, and diseases. Listening for this phenomenon means becoming aware of the immense destruction that is happening to amphibian habitats due to human activities. One way to listen would be to follow news related to amphibian populations, such as scientific studies, reports from conservation organizations, and any developments related to threats impacting amphibians. It is also important to listen to the affected populations and cultures, by including them in conversations about how to protect and restore these habitats. Additionally, listening means advocating for the protection of amphibian habitats, and educating others about the importance of these species and their ecosystems.  To detect the amphibian apocalypse, researchers must closely monitor amphibian populations, paying close attention during the breeding season. Researchers should monitor the health and population of amphibians, looking for any signs of stress, abnormality or decrease in numbers. They should also closely monitor water, air and soil quality and temperature, as these conditions can play a major role in determining the health of amphibians populations. They should also be on the lookout for emerging diseases that can spread quickly, decimating whole populations. Finally, they should be vigilant in identifying and controlling pollutants and invasive species that can harm amphibians and their ecosystems.  Listening for the amphibian apocalypse would involve paying attention to news reports, academic research, and other sources of information regarding the population health of amphibians in various regions. Additionally, monitoring changes in amphibian numbers and behavior over time could provide important data that could signal an amphibian apocalypse. Scientists could also study changes in water quality, climate, and other environmental factors that could be contributing to the decline in amphibian populations.']",
131,Plastic island: How our trash is destroying paradise,"['The so-called “Plastic Island” is a real phenomenon and a growing environmental problem. It is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is made up of millions of tonnes of plastic debris, much of it originating from illegal dumping and irresponsible disposal of marine debris. This debris is largely composed of plastic and other non-biodegradable materials, such as metal, glass, and foam. As the debris accumulates, it is breaking down into smaller particles, resulting in the formation of a vast “plastic soup” throughout the surrounding waters.  The presence of this huge plastic mass is having disastrous consequences for many of the vulnerable species in the area that rely on the ocean for their food supply, such as sea turtles and sea birds. These creatures can become entangled in the plastic, or can mistake it for prey, leading to starvation and death. In addition, plastic debris absorbs toxins from the marine environment, which are then passed up the food chain, eventually affecting humans as well.  The Plastic Island is growing larger every day, and it is estimated that by 2050 the amount of debris in the ocean will double. This is why it is so important to take action now to combat this growing environmental disaster. The solutions include reducing plastic consumption, increased recycling, and improved waste management, as well as the creation of marine reserves and ocean clean-up campaigns. If we are to save our oceans and the species that rely on them, then the time to act is now.']",

Yes, when the coral disappears, so will the species that rely on it for survival. When coral reefs are destroyed, the animals, fish, and other organisms that rely on them for food and shelter can no longer survive in those areas. When coral reefs are destroyed, the entire ecosystem that exists within it is also destroyed. Without coral reefs, the species that depend on them could become extinct.  Without coral, the species that depend on coral for their ecosystem—like fish, crustaceans, and sea turtles—will have nowhere to live and food sources will be greatly impacted. This will lead to population decline and eventual extinction for many of these species.  Yes, when the coral disappears, the organisms that depend on it for food, habitat, and protection will also disappear. The destruction of coral reefs also has a number of additional adverse impacts on the wider marine environment and other species that depend on coral reefs for shelter and food.

The old man decided to befriend the bee, and whenever it came to visit, he would greet it with a smile and a few words of welcome. The bee began coming more and more often, until one day it even landed on the old man’s hand.  The old man was enchanted by the small creature and began to take it with him on his daily walks around the village. Everywhere he went, the bee followed, fluttering around the old man’s head and shoulders, until eventually it became his constant companion.  The old man and the bee were happy together, and everyone in the village was charmed by their friendship. The two were considered a good omen, a sign of luck and good fortune, and everywhere they went, people greeted them with joy and happiness.  The old man and the bee were friends until the very end, and they are remembered fondly in the village to this day.  Once upon a time, an old man lived in a small village by the sea. Every day he took his fishing rod and went to the beach. One day, while he was fishing, he spotted a bee, buzzing around his face.   The bee seemed to be lost, so the old man decided to help her. He built a small shelter from sticks and leaves and placed it on the beach, so that the bee could have a safe place to rest.   That evening, the old man returned. To his surprise, the bee was still there, and she was looking more energized. She thanked the old man for his kindness, and promised to bring him luck in exchange.   From that day on, the old man's luck changed, and he had more fish than ever. He thanked the bee for her help, and they became friends. Whenever the old man went to the beach, the bee was always there, waiting for him.   The old man and the bee had a special bond, and no matter the weather, they were always there for each other.']",
134,Sixth extinction: 20 years to stop ecological collapse,"['The sixth mass extinction is likely the most severe in human history and could lead to ecological collapse if not addressed soon. To prevent this, governments around the world must take proactive steps to reduce human pressures on the environment. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources, protecting habitats from development, and phasing out unsustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, governments should prioritize conservation, restoration, and biodiversity protection projects, as well as providing financial and technical support for local communities to restore and manage their natural resources. If these steps are not taken soon, the world could be facing an unprecedented and irreversible collapse of its ecosystems. We have approximately 20 years to stop this from occurring, so it is vital that governments start to take serious action now.  The sixth extinction is a very real threat to the world’s biodiversity and ecosystems. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) estimates that species extinction rates are up to 1,000 times higher than their natural background rate.   In order to reverse this trend it will take concerted action over the next 20 years. This will involve a range of measures such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, tackling illegal wildlife trade, and protecting and restoring ecosystems.   Stopping ecological collapse will also require better management of agricultural and fisheries activities, which are major drivers of the sixth extinction. Sustainable fishing practices, along with the establishment of marine protected areas, need to be implemented so that our oceans can recover. Additionally, there needs to be greater investment in public education and awareness programmes so that people are aware of the impacts of their actions and their responsibility to care for their environment.  Finally, governments around the world need to shift their focus away from short-term economic benefits and instead look to develop a ‘green economy’ with an emphasis on sustainability and ecological stewardship. This must also be supported by fair and equitable regulations and incentives that encourage sustainable development and reward those who protect nature.   By making these changes, we can halt the sixth extinction and prevent further ecological collapse. It will take a concerted effort from governments, industry, civil society and individuals over the next 20 years to make this happen.']",
135,How to stop the sixth mass extinction,"['1. Reduce overconsumption and waste production: We should all strive to reduce our consumption of non-renewable resources and limit our waste production. This will reduce the strain on our environment and the ecosystems it supports.  2. Protect habitats and ecosystems: We should work to protect the habitats and ecosystems of vulnerable species. This will create a shelter for these species to thrive without fear of human-caused destruction.  3. Sustainable agriculture: We should move away from practices that cause deforestation, reduce food waste, and use sustainable agriculture and aquaculture methods to reduce our environmental impact.  4. Reduce emissions: We should reduce emissions from transportation, power plants, and other sources in order to reduce the rate of climate change.  5. Reduce pollution: We should reduce pollution from both point and non-point sources in order to reduce the effects of pollution on the environment.  6. Increase education and awareness: We should increase public education and awareness about the effects of human actions on the environment and the need to protect vulnerable species.  1. Reduce Emissions: Use of clean renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming, halting the current extinction rate.  2. Support Conservation Efforts: Support local and global conservation efforts that are dedicated to protecting endangered species and preserving their habitats.  3. Reduce Human Encroachment: Limit human activity in areas with fragile and endangered species by imposing regulations and restrictions.  4. Raise Public Awareness: Educate the public on the dangers of the sixth mass extinction and make them aware of ways to reduce their own impact on the environment.  5. Encourage Sustainable Practices: Promote sustainable practices that are focused on preserving and protecting the environment rather than exploiting the natural resources.']",

They have been assigned to a room to practice writing for a class.  On a recent day, about a dozen inmates sat at tables in a classroom, working in relative silence, penning stories and poems. They were the newest students in a creative writing class organized by the prison’s education department.  “This is the first creative writing class here at MCIW, so it was really a great opportunity to give the women an opportunity to explore their writing skills,” said Heather Kelly, an English instructor at the prison who teaches the class.  The classroom is an intimate haven of sorts, a place where the inmates can find solace and comfort as they work on their writing. As the women write about their pasts, hopes and fears, Kelly guides them, helping them develop their stories.  “It’s a safe space for them,” Kelly said. “We’re focusing on the present and the future, and it’s really empowering for them to be able to express themselves.”  The women come to class with basic story ideas or personal reflections. Some of them write about the struggles of growing up in tough neighborhoods, the burden of guilt that comes with having a criminal record and their hopes for the future. The structure of the class allows them to explore their feelings without fear of judgment.  “It’s a space where we can talk about our experiences and express our emotions,” said Marcella Jaimes, one of the students. “It’s a place where we can be open and vulnerable and free of judgment.”  It’s also a place where the women can learn to express themselves more clearly.

142,Six women. Three nursing homes. And the man accused of rape and abuse,"['It was a horrifying story that shook the nation. In June 2017, a 70-year-old man was arrested in Ohio for allegedly raping and abusing elderly women in three nursing homes over the course of five years.  Six women between the ages of 75 and 95 were identified as victims. They all lived in different nursing homes in the same county.  The man was charged with multiple counts of rape, gross sexual imposition and sexual battery. If convicted, he could face life in prison.  The case has since prompted a debate about the need for better protection of elderly residents in nursing homes, who are among the most vulnerable in our society. The debate highlights the need to be ever vigilant in identifying and dealing with any potential threat of abuse or exploitation against seniors.  It is a reminder to all of us that we can never take the safety of our elderly loved ones for granted.  The story began in March 2019 when six elderly women from three nursing homes in the Brazilian state of Bahia came forward to make allegations of rape and sexual abuse against a man who had been working at the homes for at least six years.  The accused man was immediately suspended from his job and was taken into custody by the local police. An investigation was opened and the victims were immediately given the support they needed by the police and the nursing homes.   The victims told harrowing stories of abuse and trauma. One victim, aged 82, recounted how the accused had raped her repeatedly while she was in her eighties. Another victim, aged 77, reported that the accused had sexually abused her while she was in a wheelchair.  The accused man faces multiple charges, including rape, attempted rape and sexual abuse. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison.  The case has sparked outrage in Brazil and has highlighted the importance of protecting vulnerable elderly in nursing homes from abuse and exploitation. The government has promised to investigate the matter and has vowed to increase protection for elderly in nursing homes. In addition, the government has called for greater public awareness about the issue of elderly abuse.   The stories of the six women have been shared widely online, and a social media campaign has been launched to raise awareness about the issue of elderly abuse. As the court case progresses, the six women will be watching closely in the hope that justice will be served.']",
143,"Sick, dying and raped in America's nursing homes","['""   This is a tragic reality that sadly happens in nursing homes across the United States. While many nursing homes strive to provide the best care for their residents, unfortunately some facilities neglect their elderly and disabled patients, leaving them vulnerable to abuse. Victims of nursing home abuse often suffer from physical and emotional neglect, financial exploitation, and sexual assault. Nursing home staff can also be the perpetrators of such abuse, creating a climate of fear and mistrust among the residents.   In order to reduce and stop the instances of abuse in nursing homes, there needs to be increased awareness of the problem and more stringent regulations in place. State and federal governments should have more oversight over nursing homes, as well as provide more resources for vulnerable residents. Furthermore, nursing homes must have strong training and accountability measures for staff, and should provide avenues for reporting potential abuse. Finally, it is important for family members and friends to stay vigilant in making sure their loved ones are receiving the proper care in their nursing home.   The mistreatment of elderly individuals in America's nursing homes is a serious and heartbreaking issue. Elder abuse and neglect occurs in nursing homes all across the nation, and it is estimated that only 1 out of every 10 incidents are reported. Elderly individuals may experience verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse in nursing homes, while others may suffer from neglect - being left in soiled beds, being denied basic medical care and nutrition, and living in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. It is estimated that 1 in 10 elderly adults will experience some form of abuse or neglect in their lifetime.  The US government has passed legislation to help prevent and protect senior citizens from abuse and neglect in nursing homes. The Elder Justice Act of 2009 makes grants available to the states to investigate and prosecute elder abuse and neglect cases and provides funds for victim services. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) also set standards for quality care for all nursing home patients and created a process for reporting and investigating allegations of abuse or neglect.  Despite legislation and initiatives in place, these measures alone cannot protect every senior citizen from abuse. Each and every one of us needs to play our part to ensure that all nursing home residents are given the respect and care they deserve. If you suspect someone is being neglected or abused in a nursing home, contact the authorities immediately and make sure the issue is handled properly. Additionally, consider volunteering or donating to organizations that provide healthcare and services to the elderly in need.']",

145,Caregiver convicted of rape in nursing home,"['It is possible for a caregiver at a nursing home to be convicted of rape. Depending on the severity and details of the incident, the penalties for a caregiver who is convicted of rape can vary. This can include incarceration, fines, supervised release, restitution, and sex offender registration. It is important to remember that these are serious crimes and the consequences can be severe if someone is convicted of rape.  If a caregiver is convicted of rape in a nursing home, they could face a variety of punishments depending on the jurisdiction and severity of the crime. Generally, these crimes are prosecuted as felonies and depending on the circumstances, could involve prison sentences, large fines, and/or community service. In some cases, the perpetrator may be required to register as a sex offender. Depending on the state, the caregiver may also lose their license and be prohibited from working in any healthcare organization.   The nursing home where the crime occurred may also face civil liability and be held accountable for negligence or oversight. Depending on the jurisdiction and the details of the case, the home may be required to pay fines, update security protocols, or even close permanently.   No matter the outcome of the criminal case, it is essential that the nursing home take all necessary steps to ensure their residents and other workers are safe and secure, as violence and abuse of any kind should not be tolerated in any healthcare setting.  A caretaker at a nursing home in the United States was recently convicted of sexual battery of an elderly patient. The caretaker, Robert White, 41, was charged with four counts of third-degree felony sexual battery upon a vulnerable adult and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation. White pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  The victim, an 89-year-old woman, told police that White had sexually assaulted her on several occasions in her room at the nursing home. The victim said White would come into her room at night and fondle her, sometimes even engaging in penetration.  White’s actions were a violation of the trust that was placed in him, and the fact that the victim was elderly makes this all the more horrific. Nursing home sexual abuse is an all-too-common occurrence, but it is one that must be stopped. The victim in this case has been sentenced justice, but the emotional and physical trauma she experienced is likely to be something she will never fully recover from.']",

150,"Conjoined twins separated, both out of surgery","['Conjoined twins can be successfully separated, and both can survive and live healthy lives after surgery. As with any major surgery, there are certain risks, such as infection and bleeding. However, in most cases the separation surgery has a high success rate with both twins surviving and thriving after the procedure. Recovery time will depend on the complexity of the surgery and the general health of the twins before the procedure.  If the conjoined twins were successfully separated, both of the twins would be out of surgery. Depending on their health, they may have to stay in the hospital for some time while they are recovering.  Conjoined twins who have been successfully separated in surgery typically remain in the hospital for several weeks. This is necessary for their medical team to closely monitor them and to provide post-operative care. Recovery usually takes 6-8 weeks, although some twins may spend up to a year in the hospital before they are cleared to go home. In most cases, both twins will be discharged from the hospital eventually.  If conjoined twins have been successfully separated during surgery, they typically both remain in the hospital for a few weeks until they have recovered and are strong enough to go home. They will also typically require physical therapy and long-term follow-up care. The prognosis and long-term outlook will depend on the twins' particular circumstances, including the type and location of the conjoined state, the complexity of the surgery, and their overall health before and after the operation.']",

154,Where Trump support and Obamacare use soar,"['Trump support and Obamacare use tend to be highest in rural and poor communities, where access to more affordable healthcare is limited. In these communities, Trump's campaign and promise to repeal Obamacare resulted in an increase in sign-ups due to fears of losing affordable healthcare.

In addition, the Trump Administration has taken steps to expand access to rural areas by expanding the number of telehealth services available and increasing the use of remote patient monitoring.  Trump support and Obamacare use are highest in states across the South, such as Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, where support for the president skews heavily Republican. These states have also seen some of the highest rates of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.  In addition to the South, Trump support and Obamacare use have also been particularly strong in the Midwest.

She then found work with the NRA, where she quickly rose through the ranks and became a Director of Political Affairs.  As an Indian woman and an active member at the NRA, Dhar has faced her share of criticism. She is quick to note, however, that not all Indians think alike and that there is much diversity in thought and opinion. Nevertheless, she acknowledges that her position is not universally accepted.  Dhar advocates for gun rights, believing that firearm ownership is a matter of personal choice and that firearms are the only means of self-defense for many.

He has spent tens of thousands of dollars of his own money and countless hours of his own time, to uncover new details and gather evidence that could help authorities find the plane.  Beckwitt's personal mission is to find out what happened to the plane, and to be reunited with his parents once again. He has travelled around the world to connect with a network of fellow investigations and researchers, and to visit sites that may hold clues as to what happened to the plane. He has used satellites, drones as well as manned aircraft to search for potential crash sites, and is in the process of carrying out an analysis of all of the data that has been collected so far.  Beckwitt is determined to continue his search for the missing plane, and is hopeful that he will eventually find some answers. His hard work and dedication is admirable, and an inspiration to all those who have been affected by the tragedy of MH370.  For K.S. Narendran, the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been a personal journey.  His wife, Chandrika Sharma, was one of the 239 passengers aboard the Boeing 777 when it disappeared in March 2014.  Mr. Narendran desperately searched for clues about the plane’s whereabouts for years, joining a network of other family members of passengers in the hopes of providing some answers for their loved ones.  When the official search for the plane ended in May 2018 without any definitive answers, Mr. Narendran was devastated. But he has continued his efforts and remains determined to find answers.  He has established the Voice 370 group to pressure officials and the airline to continue the search or share evidence of what could have happened. He has also been lobbying officials in the Malaysian government, who recently promised to share the findings of their investigation.  Mr. Narendran says he will continue pressing for answers until he gets them.  “For us, it’s not a closure,” he said. “We need to know; we need to have answers, so we can move on with our lives.”']",
161,How ordinary people become 'white supremacists by default',"['People can become “white supremacists by default” if they are raised in an environment where they are exposed to white supremacist views and beliefs. This could be through family members who hold these beliefs, or by living in an area where white supremacist values and rhetoric are part of everyday culture. It could also come from online sources that perpetuate white supremacist ideas and beliefs. In some cases, individuals could simply be exposed to these beliefs without actively seeking them out and can adopt them without realizing they are doing so.  Ordinary people can become white supremacists by default through a variety of means. Firstly, they can be indoctrinated into white supremacist beliefs by those in their social network, such as family members or friends. Secondly, they may be exposed to white supremacist messages and ideologies through internet forums and websites which promote white supremacist views. Thirdly, media coverage of white supremacist events or news stories can shape their views and encourage them to sympathize with white supremacist ideals. Finally, economic insecurity and fear of “the other” can lead people to embrace white supremacist beliefs as a way to protect themselves and their families.  White supremacy is an extreme ideology that places white people at the top of a racial hierarchy. It has become increasingly prominent in recent years, and those who adhere to it often seek to establish systems of racial segregation and control. In some cases, ordinary people can become white supremacists by default.  This can occur when someone is exposed to white supremacist rhetoric and beliefs but has not taken the time to critically analyze them or form their own opinions. It can also occur as a result of a culture of silence surrounding white supremacy and racism. When individuals do not discuss or challenge these beliefs, they can unknowingly support them or ""go along"" with them without realizing it.  Finally, it can happen when people fail to recognize the systemic racism in their communities, or do not take action to challenge it. For example, some people may be aware that African Americans have been historically disenfranchised, but they may not take action to protect their rights. By not standing up against racism and white supremacy, these individuals can become complicit in the perpetuation of white supremacy.']",
162,Get ready for a more militant and 'woke' NAACP,"['The NAACP is already a leading civil rights organization in the U.S. and is continuously working to fight for equal rights and justice. With the surge of social media and the Black Lives Matter movement, the NAACP is continuing to become more militant and advocating for systemic change. Moving forward, the NAACP plans to focus on grassroots organizing and community education on issues of racism, police brutality, and other civil rights issues. Additionally, it plans to increase its presence in the political arena, advocating for legislation promoting racial justice.  The NAACP is an organization that has a long history of fighting for civil rights for African Americans. The organization is continually evolving to meet the needs of the African American community in the 21st century. As such, the organization is increasingly becoming more militant and ""woke"" in its approach to issues of civil rights. This includes advocating for police reform, economic equality, and social justice. The NAACP is committed to continuing to fight for the rights of African Americans and its members will continue to be a driving force in this fight in the years to come.  The NAACP is continuing to move in a more militant direction, meaning that it is taking a much more active stance in fighting for civil rights, particularly for people of colour. This includes taking a hard stance against racial injustice and being more vocal in the fight for Black lives. The organization is also increasing its engagement with younger generations and adapting to the changing times by instilling a “woke” mentality. This involves educating members on topics such as racism, sexism, and classism, and calling out cultural forms of oppression. The NAACP is also advocating for greater social and economic justice, and is widening its scope to include other minorities such as LGBTQ+ and Indigenous people.']",
163,The first time I realized I was black,"['was when my older brother pointed out the color of my skin. He told me that I was darker than him and so I was black. From that point forward, I realized that I was a part of a community that was identified and defined by its color. I was part of something larger and stronger than myself, and I was proud of that. I gained an understanding of my identity and the importance of recognizing and celebrating it. It helped me find my place in the world, and I am forever grateful for that. was when I was about 8 years old. I was playing at a playground near my house with some other kids and one of the kids asked me if I was black. I said yes, and then started to understand that being black was different from being white or of any other race. This was the first time I was aware of my skin color and that it was different from some of the other kids.  I can't say for sure the exact moment I realized I was black, but I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood, so I always knew that I was different in some way. As a kid, I remember being curious about what it meant to be black and how people interacted with me because of it. As I got older, I started to really look deeper into my identity and appreciate what being black meant to me. was when I was in preschool. I had been playing with my classmates, who were mostly white, and when our teacher asked us to line up, I noticed that I was the only one out of my group that had a darker skin color. I felt a sense of disconnection and realized in that moment that I was different than most of my peers.']",

165,'Folks don't feel safe',"['Folks do not feel safe in many communities due to violence, crime, and other threats. Issues such as poverty, racism, and lack of access to resources can contribute to a community feeling unsafe and can lead to people feeling isolated, scared, and unable to trust their environment. Additionally, natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorism, and other events can affect how safe a community feels.  Folks don't feel safe due to an increase in crime, the lack of police presence in certain areas, the prevalence of fearmongering in the media, and an overall sense of unease in the world.  Folks may not feel safe in their communities for a variety of reasons. This could include a lack of trust in law enforcement, poverty and inequality, poor mental health services, racial and gender discrimination, or a feeling of being constantly under threat of violence or crime. It could also include a sense of isolation or alienation, or a lack of community support.  In many communities, people may not feel safe due to high levels of crime or threats of violence, whether real or perceived. This can include areas prone to gang violence, violent crime, or property crime. In these areas, feelings of insecurity can cause people to avoid certain activities or locations such as public parks or transportation routes. People may also be concerned about the presence of strangers or the lack of police presence in their area. Furthermore, people may feel unsafe in certain scenarios due to the fear of harassment or discrimination.']",

168,Amazon natives hold on to tradition,"['and protect the environment  Native peoples in the Amazon rainforest have held onto their traditional practices and long-standing relationships with the land for centuries. They are deeply connected to their ancestral lands and have an interdependent relationship with their environment. They depend on the rainforest for food, medicine, and clean water, and in turn, they protect the forests and their culture by living in harmony with their natural surroundings. Many of these communities have protected their territory and launched innovative initiatives to preserve the rainforest, like sustainable forestry and small-scale regenerative farming.  They also conduct frequent patrols to monitor illegal activities and protect the local wildlife. These efforts are essential for the conservation of the Amazon’s biodiversity and maintaining the balance of the ecosystems.  Many Amazon natives hold on to their traditional ways of life in spite of the pressures of modernization and globalization. They still practice traditional hunting and gathering, use traditional medicines and healing practices, and maintain their language and culture. They strive to maintain the natural balance of their forests and respect the animals and plants they find there. This is a testament to their strong sense of pride and commitment to preserving the natural environment and their ancient customs.  The Amazon rainforest is home to many indigenous tribes who practice a variety of traditional cultures and beliefs. These indigenous populations continue to preserve their culture, language, and traditions despite outside influences and pressures. These traditions can include things like traditional foods, ceremonies, and values. Hunting, fishing, and gathering are some of the traditional activities that many tribes still rely on to survive. Tribes also pass down stories, songs, and dances from generation to generation to keep their culture alive.']",

In the past two decades, we have witnessed the end of global conflicts, the promotion of human rights and democracy, and the emergence of powerful international institutions that foster economic development, environmental protection, and social justice. On the global stage, unprecedented progress has been made in addressing global poverty, combating the spread of HIV and AIDS, and bolstering efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Even in the face of new threats, such as terrorism and pandemics, the international community has become better positioned to respond and adapt. The world is a place of transformation and hope – a place where a better future is being built, one step at a time, under the rainbow.

Kurdish Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) and the People’s Protection Units (YPG) are two all-female militia groups that are actively battling ISIS across Iraq and Syria alongside Arab, Syriac, and other minority forces. The groups have become known for their fierce and determined battle tactics, often confronting ISIS forces on the front line. In addition to their military role, the YPJ and YPG are also advocates for equal rights and female empowerment, working to break through traditional gender roles and championing the rights of women and minorities.

172,Girls behind bars tell their stories,"['Stories from incarcerated women vary greatly and can be heartbreaking, inspiring, or educational. Many incarcerated women who share their stories do so to help others in similar situations, to inspire others to make different life choices, or to shed light on difficult justice system issues.  For example, U.S. journalist Piper Kerman's memoir Orange is the New Black tells the story of her time spent in prison. Other incarcerated women, such as those featured in the NPR radio series “Women Behind Bars,” share stories of their lives before and after incarceration – often focusing on the challenges of finding their place in the world upon release and reintegration into society.   Organizations such as Voice of the Experienced (VOTE) also allow incarcerated women to tell their stories by providing them a platform to speak out about policy issues. The media provides a powerful outlet for women to share their stories and connect with those outside of prison. These stories are intended to show how the justice system has impacted individuals and to raise awareness of the need for reform.  Since the late 1990s, Behind Bars: Voices from Prison project has worked to give incarcerated women a platform to share their stories and advocate for a better criminal justice system. This project has featured the stories of over 30 incarcerated women through books, documentaries, and more. Behind Bars focuses on uplifting the voices of incarcerated women and raising awareness of the realities of women in prison, including the lack of healthcare, overcrowding, and discrimination against women of color. Through stories of abuse, triumph, and perseverance, Behind Bars aims to remind readers that these women are not just inmates, but mothers, daughters, and sisters in need of compassion and a chance at a better life.']",
173,Up close in the brutal world of a female fight club,"['Up close in a female fight club, the environment is often intense and brutal. The fights themselves involve a wide range of martial arts styles and extreme levels of physical contact and brutality. The fighters must be tough and highly motivated, not just for the duration of the fight, but for the entire event. The spectators of a female fight club experience violence up close, sometimes with a visceral feeling of fear and adrenaline that can only come from witnessing a fight first-hand. The fighters must use strategy and sometimes rely on their small size and agility to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. It's not always about physical strength; it takes a combination of technical skill, raw power, and psychological acumen to walk away from a fight unscathed.  The experience of attending a female fight club can be both intimidating and exhilarating. It is a world away from the bright lights and production values of a professional boxing event. The atmosphere at a female fight club is both gritty and raw, with little protection and no rules.   The fights, which typically consist of two women boxing or kickboxing in the ring, can be intense. The competitors are all experienced fighters and the intensity of the match can be shocking. There is no time limit or referee and the fighters are allowed to use elbow and knee strikes. The fight can only finish when one competitor gives up or is rendered unconscious, meaning fights can go on for a long time.   The crowd at a fight club is often a strange mixture of spectators, including hardcore fight fans, celebrities, and regular people who just want to see some real-life competition. The atmosphere can be charged with excitement, but also a sense of danger.   Attending a female fight club can be a unique experience and one that is not for the faint of heart.']",
174,Crawling in a 'polio-free' country,"['Crawling in a polio-free country is a relatively easy task, as the risk of contracting the disease is virtually nonexistent. If a person is traveling to a country where polio is present, however, it is important to ensure that all medical precautions are taken in order to avoid contracting the disease. This includes obtaining any necessary vaccines and making sure to practice safe hygiene habits such as washing hands regularly, avoiding contact with those who are sick, and avoiding any contact with the feces of potentially infected individuals. It is also important to reinforce strict hygiene habits with children, as polio is often spread among them through contact with infected feces.  Crawling in a polio-free country can be accomplished by following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on health and safety in that country. The CDC recommends visiting your doctor before traveling to a polio-free country to determine if any vaccinations are needed and to discuss any other health risks that may be present. Additionally, travelers should practice good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly, avoiding uncooked foods, and drinking water that is boiled, filtered, or treated. Travelers should also make sure to keep their immunizations up to date, as this can help prevent the spread of polio and other contagious diseases. Finally, travelers should speak with their physician about any other preventative measures that can be taken, such as receiving the polio vaccine if it is available in the country.  It is possible to do a lot of activities in a polio-free country including web crawling. Web crawling involves systematically accessing the internet with the aim of gathering data, such as text and images. For example, a web crawler can be used to collect data about a certain topic, analyze the relationships between different websites, or explore the structure of the web. Web crawling is a very useful tool in a polio-free country because it can help to monitor the health of the population and investigate diseases that may exist in the population. It can also help to identify risk factors associated with diseases, alert public health authorities to emerging health threats, and serve as a resource for data mining and analytics.']",
175,Giving a face to Sudan's refugee crisis,"['One way to give a face to Sudan's refugee crisis is to highlight the personal stories of those affected by it. Documentaries, films, photography, and interviews featuring refugees' firsthand accounts can help to shed light on the reality of life in refugee camps and the difficult decisions that many Sudanese people have to make. Additionally, providing profiles of people directly affected by the crisis can help to give context to the larger scope of the conflict and inspire empathy amongst viewers and readers.  The face of the Sudanese refugee crisis is a young woman named Nahid. She is a 17-year-old from Darfur who has fled the violence in her home country and is now living in a refugee camp in Kenya. She has seen unspeakable horrors and has come to the camp with her mother and three siblings. Despite her dire circumstances, she remains determined to create a better life for her family. She dreams of one day attending university and making something of herself despite all the obstacles she faces. Her story serves as a reminder of the resilience of the Sudanese people and the courage of those who have had to flee their homes.  The face of Sudan's refugee crisis is one of immense suffering and hardship. The refugees, who are largely from the Darfur region, have been victimized by intense violence, displacement and exploitation. They live in overcrowded refugee camps, often without proper healthcare and adequate food and water. They rely on humanitarian aid and struggle to earn the means to sustain themselves. Children are particularly vulnerable, as they must often go without basic education and protection. The faces of these refugee men, women and children show the resilience of humans in the face of immense suffering and the continuing need for support to ensure their safety and well-being.']",

177,Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"['In the wake of two student deaths at a New Jersey high school, reports have emerged that school officials were aware of potential trouble between students long before the deaths occurred.  According to several news reports, police were called to the high school in the days leading up to the deaths several times for incidents between the students involved. In one instance, a student who was killed in the incident had reportedly been seen pushing another student in the hallway.  School officials are now facing criticism from parents, students and community members, who say that the school did not do enough to prevent the tragedy from occurring. Some are calling for an investigation into the school's policies and procedures for handling student disputes.  It remains unclear why school officials did not take more action to address the behavior of the students before the tragedy occurred. However, it is clear that the school was aware of potential trouble between students, and could have taken steps to address it before it escalated to the point of tragedy.  The deaths of some students in high schools have brought to light the struggle that many students face in their daily lives, as well as the issues that have been happening in the schools themselves. In some cases, it appears that school administrators were aware of issues leading up to the deaths, but did not take action to address them.  In one case in the United States, a high school student in Indiana was found dead of a drug overdose in the bathroom. Reports claim that the school was aware of the student’s drug use, but did not take action to address the issue and put the student in a safe place.  In another case, a student in Canada died of suicide, and it was later revealed that the school had been warned of bullying and mental health issues in the student before the death. The school was aware of the issues, but did not take any action or offer support.  These cases show that in some cases, schools are aware of issues that can lead to tragedy, but do not take any action to address them. It is important for school administrators to recognize that they have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and to take action when they are aware of potential issues.']",
178,The real story behind those Planned Parenthood videos,"['The videos released by the anti-abortion group, the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), purported to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetus tissue. An investigation by the California Department of Justice concluded that the videos were heavily edited and did not indicate any illegal activity by Planned Parenthood. The National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood filed separate lawsuits against CMP claiming that its members had posed as executives of a fake company in order to gain access to meetings and create deceptive videos.  In addition to the California Department of Justice investigation, two separate congressional investigations found no evidence to support the allegation that Planned Parenthood profited from fetal tissue donation.  The videos gained international attention and sparked significant political debate among those who support abortion rights and those who are opposed. In response to the videos, several states moved to defund Planned Parenthood. They were ultimately unsuccessful, though some restrictions on the use of public funds to cover abortion services remain in effect.  In October 2017, a Texas jury awarded Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas more than $2.3 million in damages in a lawsuit against CMP. The jury found CMP guilty of fraud, illegal recording, and breach of contract.  The 2015 Planned Parenthood videos controversy stemmed from a series of secretly recorded videos released by an anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress (CMP). The videos featured a doctor from Planned Parenthood who discussed the organ donation process and the sale of fetal tissue.  The videos sparked a nationwide debate, with some believing that Planned Parenthood was selling aborted fetal tissue for profit. Planned Parenthood strongly denied this allegation and argued that the videos were heavily edited and misleading.  In the end, several investigations found that Planned Parenthood was not breaking any laws and was not selling fetal tissue for profit. The investigations also revealed that the videos were heavily edited, and that the doctor in the videos was not talking about selling tissue but rather discussing legally permitted reimbursements for medical expenses associated with tissue donations.  Planned Parenthood was cleared by the investigations, but their reputation was still tarnished. The videos and the controversy that followed caused a decrease in public support for the organization and had long-term effects on their funding and services.']",

According to the newspaper, the program was ""riddled with fraud, with employers being paid for jobs that didn't exist.""   The investigation by the Sun-Times revealed that ""some of the jobs supposedly held by disabled individuals were held by healthy individuals, [and] some employers may have used CWO as an employment subsidy.""

In response to the investigation, the Labor Department announced that it was taking ""measures to ensure that all CWO participants are verified and only employers abiding by the program's criteria are compensated."" The department also said it would establish new requirements for employers to ensure that job placements were appropriate.

The four charity organizations named in the complaint are the Cancer Fund of America, Inc., Cancer Support Services, Inc., Children’s Cancer Fund of America, Inc., and The Breast Cancer Society, Inc. The FTC also named the four charities' operators as defendants.  The complaint alleges that these charities misled donors by claiming to help cancer patients facing terminal illness and other medical needs, when in fact the majority of donations went to the operators in the form of personal expenses, including cars, luxury cruises and college tuition payments.  The FTC stated that the donations to these charities were not used to help cancer patients but were instead misappropriated for the personal benefit of the operators. The complaint also alleges that the charities fraudulently solicited donations via telemarketing, direct mail and online campaigns.  The case is currently pending and is being heard in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. If the complaint is successful, the defendants could be ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has identified four cancer charities as fraudulent: Cancer Fund of America, Inc., Children’s Cancer Fund of America, Inc., Cancer Support Services, Inc., and the American Breast Cancer Foundation, Inc. According to the FTC, these organizations falsely claimed that donations would directly support cancer patients, when in fact the majority of the funds were being used for unrelated purposes, such as personal expenses for the charity’s operators. The FTC has shut down the charities and is working to have the operators of the charities pay back money to donors.']",

In one case, a security guard was caught on camera opening a suitcase to take cash and electronics. In another, a baggage handler was seen rummaging through a passenger's belongings. In a third case, an employee was recorded snatching a watch from a bag. Airport authorities have taken action against the culprits, including fines, demotions and job loss. Airport security has also been increased, including better screening of staff and better surveillance of baggage handling areas.  Hidden cameras showing airport workers stealing from bags is a serious problem that airports and airlines should take seriously. It is important to install surveillance cameras in airports to help deter theft and to help catch any workers who may be stealing from passengers' bags. Airlines should also create policies and procedures on how to handle suspected theft and should provide their employees with training on proper security protocols. It is also important for passengers to be aware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious behavior they may observe.  Hidden camera footage of airport workers stealing from bags has been reported in a variety of locations around the world, including the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. In most cases, the employees work for airport ground staff, baggage handlers, and cleaning companies employed by the airport.  In some cases, the camera footage has resulted in criminal charges and convictions for the workers involved. It's important to be aware that the vast majority of airport workers are honest and trustworthy individuals.

184,It's not over: Veterans waiting months for appointments,"['Veterans are waiting months for medical appointments at Veterans Affairs facilities, despite promises from the federal government that delays would be eliminated by the end of 2015.  The lengthy waits, which often top three months, have persisted despite the VA's headline-making efforts to reduce the amount of time veterans must wait for medical care.  Former VA Secretary Robert McDonald last year announced that the agency was aiming to dramatically reduce wait times, pledging that veterans would be able to get appointments within 30 days.  But that promise seems to have gone unfulfilled, as the Department of Veterans Affairs' own data show veterans still face long waits.  Overall, the average wait time for a new patient is 44 days, according to the VA. That figure is slightly lower than a year ago, when the average wait was 50 days, but it is still too long for many veterans.  The waits vary from facility to facility. In Alaska, for example, the average wait is 83 days, while in Florida it's just 21 days.  And the waits are higher for certain types of care. The average wait for a mental health appointment, for example, is 51 days.  The VA has taken steps to reduce the waits, such as hiring more staff and expanding the number of facilities that accept veterans for care. But the waits are still too long for many veterans, particularly those in rural areas, who are struggling with mental health issues or other long-term illnesses.  And while the VA has made some strides in cutting wait times, it's not clear if the agency can sustain those gains. As the demand for medical care increases, it could become more difficult for the VA to keep up.  Veterans deserve timely and reliable access to quality medical care, not months-long waits. The VA must redouble its efforts to ensure that all veterans get the care they've earned.']",

In the United States, it is illegal for lobbyists to make direct campaign contributions to candidates or political parties, or to reimburse politicians for expenses incurred as part of their political activities.

188,Alabama town mirrors US class divide on immigration,"['Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the small Alabama town of Albertville is a microcosm of the nation's immigration debate. On one side, you have a large Latino community made up primarily of Mexican immigrants who have been in the area for generations. On the other side, you have a largely white population that is often hostile to immigration and supportive of restrictive state laws designed to combat it. In Albertville, the divide between the two groups is stark, with little understanding on either side. Immigrants often face discrimination, while native-born locals feel threatened by the influx of foreigners who they perceive as a job threat. Despite their differences, both sides agree that the immigration debate should be handled in a fair and humane way. But the presence of these differences in such a small town reflects the polarization that exists within the country as a whole.  The town of Jasper, Alabama is emblematic of the national class divide on immigration. Located in the heart of one of the poorest counties in the state, Jasper is home to a large Latino population, primarily from Mexico, who have lived in the town for generations. While the majority of Jasper’s residents are in favor of a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, those who are better off financially and live in the suburbs outside of town are more likely to oppose it. This opposition has been on display in the past few months as the Trump administration has increased its focus on deporting undocumented immigrants across the country. Despite this, many in Jasper believe that the town’s Latino community is an important part of its economic and cultural character. As a result, community leaders are pushing for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for their neighbors.']",
189,The truth about the white working class,"['The white working class is a large and diverse demographic that faces a variety of challenges. This includes persistent economic insecurity, stagnant wage growth, decreasing job security, educational inequality, and a lack of economic advancement. Additionally, many members of the white working class experience increased levels of social stigma and alienation. This can lead to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Despite these challenges, many members of the white working class continue to strive for better outcomes and a better future for themselves and their families.  The white working class has been disproportionately impacted by economic inequality, automation and the decline of union jobs. Many white working class individuals are living in poverty, struggling to pay for basic necessities, and facing economic insecurity. Additionally, some white people from the working class experience racism and discrimination, both in the workforce and in everyday life. This has led to feelings of resentment and frustration, which can manifest in various ways. The white working class today faces both economic and social challenges, often in tandem. It is important to understand the systemic issues these individuals face, as well as to recognize the often overlooked struggles and stories of the white working class.  The white working class is generally defined as non-college educated white Americans who are employed in manual or lower-paid service occupations. The white working class is increasingly facing economic hardship, with rising inequality and stagnating wages. Many experts point to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt and other areas due to globalization as one of the main factors driving the economic decline of the white working class in recent decades. In addition, the white working class is also dealing with a series of social and cultural changes that can be seen in the declining social capital, an increase in opioid addiction, and a decrease in marriage rates. Despite these challenges, the white working class is still an important demographic in the United States and will likely remain so in the foreseeable future.']",

In fact, the US economy and job market still depend heavily on the labor and skills of working class whites.  It's impossible to say definitively, as there are too many other variables in play. That being said, there is evidence that working class whites have been on a downward trajectory in terms of economic stability and job opportunity in recent decades. Automation and the decline of manufacturing jobs have disproportionately impacted them, and many are now struggling to make ends meet or find a path to a better future. With that in mind, it is urgent that those in power take steps to address the challenges facing working class whites—whether through training, wage increases, or other measures.  The future of working class Whites is uncertain. Economic forces such as global competition, automation, and changing labor markets have caused widespread job losses and downward pressure on wages. At the same time, the U.S. is becoming a more diverse and multicultural society. As a result, some experts are predicting a decrease in opportunities for White workers, as non-White workers become more competitive in the job market. Despite this, it is not all doom and gloom for working class Whites. While they may face increased competition, there are still many jobs available and opportunities out there. Additionally, the education and training that they can receive may help them remain competitive in the job market.']",

193,West Virginia's 'forgotten tribe', why the white working class feels left behind,"['West Virginia's ""forgotten tribe"" refers to its white working class, who feel that their voices aren't taken seriously by politicians and the media. This has been exacerbated by the fact that the state has been heavily impacted by the decline of coal and other industries, which has caused many people to struggle financially and feel left out of the economic recovery of the last decade. This feeling of being disregarded by the popular culture has been further aggravated by the rise of progressive causes, which are often seen as alien to their values. The lack of investment in education and infrastructure has made it difficult for people in these communities to access jobs and opportunities, perpetuating their plight.  The white working class in West Virginia feels left behind because of economic changes, the loss of traditional industries, and new political forces that have resulted in a widening of the gap between the wealthy and the working class. The coal industry was the traditional economic backbone of West Virginia, providing well-paying jobs for many of the state’s residents, but these jobs have been disappearing due to automation and improvements in productivity. In addition, new political forces, particularly the rise of the Tea Party and its anti-tax, anti-regulatory agenda, have disproportionately hurt working-class communities. These policies, combined with the slow economic recovery since the Great Recession, have caused an increase in poverty, unemployment, and underemployment, while wealthy Americans have seen their incomes rise. This has resulted in a feeling of hopelessness among the white working class, leading many to feel like they are a forgotten tribe in their own state.']"

When asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Muslims, white working-class Americans are evenly divided. Forty-five percent hold a favorable opinion, while 45% hold an unfavorable opinion. However, when broken down into subgroups, white working-class Americans who are working are more likely than those who are not working to have a favorable opinion of Muslims (51% vs. 34 %, respectively).

This poll explores the views of white working-class Americans on Muslim immigrants. Through the poll, respondents were asked questions about their feelings towards Muslim immigrants, how they view their impact on the US, and how they view Muslim immigrants as a group. The poll found that while the majority of white working-class Americans tend to have negative views on Muslim immigrants, they also are more likely to see them favorably if they are employed, have good jobs and high levels of education. Additionally, a majority also believes that Muslim immigrants should be allowed to work and live in the US.

195,"Working class whites blame Washington, but still want more government help","['It is a complex reality facing both the Democratic and Republican parties. Class divisions in America are deepening and the economic outlook appears bleak. Working class whites often blame Washington for the state of their economic and social situation, while also hoping that the government will step in to provide more assistance. This creates a conundrum for politicians as they try to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the popular will of these voters. Despite their mistrust in Washington, working class whites often favor government programs that are intended to provide economic relief, such as Social Security and Medicare. They also tend to support initiatives like public education, job training programs, and workforce development initiatives. While it is unlikely that all working class whites will ever fully embrace a government-oriented approach to economic stability, it is important for politicians to take their views into consideration when crafting legislation and policies.  This is an interesting but complex attitude. It reveals how the anger, frustration and doubt felt by many working-class whites toward the federal government is not necessarily a rejection of all forms of government assistance and intervention. Instead, these sentiments can be seen as a skepticism and distrust of government that is still rooted in a sense of expectation and hope for government programs that can positively impact their lives.   The desire for more government help among working-class whites likely arises from the fact that they are often unable to access the opportunities and resources available to other groups due to systemic discrimination and inequality. In addition, they may also feel that they have been forgotten by politicians in Washington and that their voices are not being heard.   Thus, the desire for more government help among working-class whites should be seen as a reflection of their recognition of the need for change and their wish to have their needs met. It is an indication of their determination to ensure that they have access to the same opportunities as other groups.']",

Their incomes tend to be lower than the national average, and they often face financial difficulties.  Politically, they tend to be conservative and to support right-wing policies. They are often distrustful of government and governmental institutions and view the current political system as corrupt and unresponsive to their needs. They are likely to be traditionalists and adhere to cultural values that are distinct from more liberal views on social issues.  Overall, they tend to view Donald Trump as a champion of their interests and a way to restore their sense of political agency. While they may not agree with every one of Trump’s policies, they are drawn to his message of economic and social populism and his strong rhetorical stance against government bureaucracy and foreign trade.  Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign saw a surge in support from white, working-class individuals. This type of voter is often characterized as socially conservative and economically anxious. These voters tend to have a blue-collar background, typically in manual labor or low-income service industries.   Politically, these individuals are often driven by their own self-interests and the belief that the government and economy have been working against them. The Trump campaign's focus on restoring the economy and working toward a more prosperous future resonated with this type of voter. Additionally, they viewed Trump as a political outsider since he had no experience in government. They saw him as an outsider who wouldn't be beholden to special interests, who could disrupt the status quo, and who could reduce their economic anxiety.  In terms of policy, these voters tend to favor a more aggressive stance on immigration, the protection of the Second Amendment, and the re-enforcement of traditional values. They also tend to be nationalistic and prioritize American interests, which makes them wary of globalization and international trade deals. They are also more likely to be suspicious of the media and be drawn to rhetoric that emphasizes strength, patriotism, and ‘Making America Great Again’.   The white, working-class voter was a key constituency for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. With his strong focus on the economy and willingness to disrupt the political status quo, he was able to reach this voter base and help propel himself to the White House.']",

206,Sex trafficking survivor who wants to end 'The Game',"['To end ""The Game,"" the survivor should reach out to local law enforcement, victim service organizations, and community members to raise awareness about the issue. They should also work with their peers in their community, other trafficking survivors and their families, to form a survivor-led organization that advocates for the rights and protection of victims of human trafficking. The organization should focus on educating the public on the signs and dangers of human trafficking, as well as working with law enforcement and other stakeholders to create policies and laws that will protect survivors and prevent more victims from entering “The Game.” Additionally, the survivor can volunteer their time with anti-trafficking organizations and use their stories to help inform the public and policymakers of just how damaging the sex trafficking industry is.  My name is Ashley and I am a survivor of sex trafficking and I want to end what I call 'The Game'.   'The Game' is a form of human trafficking that preys on young girls and boys. It is a sophisticated technique of blackmail and manipulation that targets the vulnerable among us – the homeless, runaway youth, those in poverty, and those coming out of foster care. Those preying on victims exploit their desperation to survive and use them for their own monetary gain.  To put an end to this game, I believe that we need to make sure that both people and resources are in place in order to provide victims of this dark industry with the help they need. In this effort, we can create awareness about sex trafficking both in the US and abroad, and put more pressure on law enforcement to crack down on those who are exploiting victims.   We also need to work on providing victims with emotional and practical support. This could be done through increased funding for programs that specifically support victims of sex trafficking, as well as increased access to medical and mental health services.  Finally, we need to work towards creating a society which values and respects the rights of all of its citizens. This includes ending poverty, providing job training and education, and improving access to quality healthcare.  The most important thing is that we must come together as a society to create a united front against this dark industry. We can make a difference if we start by raising awareness about this issue and doing what we can to support those most vulnerable to exploitation. Together, we can end 'The Game' and help bring freedom and justice to those who have been exploited.']",
207,Workers fight for rights at 'ground zero for US slavery',"['At the heart of the United States' labor migration system lies a small, rural town in California that has become the de facto ground zero for modern-day slave labor. For years, this community of approximately 5,000 people has been subject to a brutal system of exploitation, with farmworkers in particular suffering the most.  These workers toil in oppressive conditions, often without proper safety equipment, often without a living wage and often without any kind of job security. With frequent reports of workers being forced into slavery by their employers, this has become a major human rights issue.  Recently, a group of courageous workers in this rural town have been pushing back against their employer's abuses and are currently fighting for their rights and for the rights of all workers in the area. They have organized strikes, filed lawsuits, and held public demonstrations in an effort to draw attention to their plight and to push for better conditions and wages.  These brave workers are standing up for their rights and for the basic human rights of all workers in the area. They are demanding fair wages, safe working conditions, and job security, and are fighting for justice and equality in what has become the ground zero for US slavery.  The Deep South state of Mississippi has been described as the ""ground zero for US slavery"", with its history and culture steeped in the legacy of racism. But a group of workers are taking a stand and demanding their rights, in what is seen as a landmark moment for civil rights in the region.  Workers at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi facility have been pushing for better working conditions and a union since 2013. They allege that the company has suppressed workers' rights and failed to protect them from racial and sexual discrimination.  The United Auto Workers (UAW) union have been leading a campaign to unionise the facility, and they are now preparing to take a vote on unionising next month. If successful, it would make the Canton plant the first unionised Nissan facility in the United States.  The push for unionisation is the latest in a long history of civil rights struggles in Mississippi. Throughout the state's history, African Americans and other minorities have faced discrimination and been denied basic rights. Even today, the poverty rate for African Americans in Mississippi is more than double the national average, illustrating the deep-rooted systemic issues of racism in the region.  The vote at Nissan's Canton facility could be a breakthrough moment in the fight for racial and economic justice in the state. It could set an example for other workers in Mississippi, showing them that they have the power to stand up for their rights and demand better conditions  If successful, the vote could also provide a platform for other movements such as the Black Lives Matter campaign, which is dedicated to eradicating systemic racism in the United States. The success of the vote at Nissan could be a significant step in the right direction, as it would provide further evidence that when people come together, they can make a real difference.']",

Many are poor, indigenous people and children from rural communities who have been lured by the promise of wages and a better life. Once there, however, they are subjected to horrific treatment, long hours, and harsh conditions. They are forced to work long hours for little or no pay, often under threat of violence. They are also exposed to hazardous conditions and dangerous chemicals, with few, if any, health or safety regulations in place to protect them. Moreover, they are often subjected to physical abuse and sexual assault. As a result, many are unable to escape their situation, leaving them trapped in a cycle of poverty and abuse.  According to a report by Human Rights Watch, thousands of people—sometimes entire families—are trapped in a form of modern-day slavery on cattle ranches in Brazil. In many cases, traffickers—sometimes working with corrupt authorities—transport victims from other parts of the country or abroad (Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru). On the ranches, they are forced to work in hazardous conditions for little or no pay, and may experience physical and verbal abuse, overcrowded and unsanitary housing, and a lack of food. They are often isolated and have little access to legal advice or government services. Despite strong legislation, Brazil continues to struggle to end the exploitation of workers on its cattle ranches.  The Brazilian government estimates that there are thousands of people, including indigenous peoples, adolescents, and adults, who are forced to work on cattle ranches in Brazil. The majority of these workers are paid extremely low wages and have no access to medical care and other basic services, while living in degrading and unsafe working conditions. Many are also exposed to hazardous pesticides and other chemicals. The government has taken some steps to combat this issue, such as creating a special investigative task force which has identified a number of cases of forced labor on Brazilian cattle ranches. Additionally, the Brazilian Labor Ministry has implemented a system of inspections which is trying to improve the working conditions in these establishments. However, much more needs to be done to protect workers from exploitation and to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect.']",

Children often must complete long hours of hard and dangerous labor for very little pay, and are often subject to physical and verbal abuse from their employers. Additionally, many of these children lack access to education and other forms of development.   This lack of financial compensation and the lack of opportunities to develop their capabilities lead to a cycle of poverty for these children and their families.

There are organizations that work to help these girls and their families break free from this cycle, such as the HOPE Project in the US and the Not For Sale Campaign in the UK.  It is sadly not uncommon for girls to be sold for sex by their mothers, often due to financial hardship or other difficult situations. The girls may be sold to traffickers, brothels, or customers. In the US, it is illegal to purchase or sell a minor for sex. If this is happening to a child, they should be connected with local social services or law enforcement to ensure they receive the help they need.  It is heartbreaking and inexcusable for a mother to sell her daughter for sex. There is no excuse for this kind of exploitation and abuse, and perpetrators should be held accountable for their actions. However, it is important to note that in many cases, these mothers may be desperate and have few other options for income or other forms of support. They may also be victims of human trafficking themselves.

In the 17-minute film, written and directed by Colin O'Toole, Ahmed speaks of his experience as a British-Asian artist and how the acts of racism and discrimination he has faced, as well as the country's ""failed promises"" of multiculturalism, have led him to a place of disillusionment with the country.  The film follows Ahmed as he takes a psychedelic journey of self-discovery, travelling to a world of visual metaphors, while his accompanying album, also titled The Long Goodbye, provides a soundtrack to his voyage of self-reflection and his thoughts on Britain come to the fore through spoken word interludes.  The resulting film and music project is an open and honest work of art that speaks to the political uncertainty of the current moment, the challenges of being part of a minority culture, and ultimately, the need for a reckoning and renewal in order to move forward. Through this work, Ahmed invites viewers to join him in holding a mirror up to British society and engaging in meaningful dialogue about the need for positive change.  Riz Ahmed, the British actor and rapper, has released an emotional album and short film called “The Long Goodbye” in which he “breaks up” with Britain.  The song and film are an artistic exploration of Ahmed's feelings about his identity as a Muslim British man and the country he grew up in. Ahmed examines the past and present of the UK through his lyrics and the imagery in the film, exploring the challenges of racism, xenophobia and inequality that he has experienced as a Muslim immigrant.  The film features Ahmed playing himself and walking through a number of British landscapes, including the Stonehenge, before he reaches a cliff overlooking the sea. At the cliff, Ahmed symbolically says goodbye to the country which he feels has ultimately failed him.  The project was produced by Ahmed and his partner, visual artist Salama Nasib. The Long Goodbye is a powerful piece of work that resonates with the feelings of many people of color in the West who have experienced racism and discrimination.']",
216,A trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits,"['No, a trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits. The EU provides a range of benefits to its members which are not available to countries outside of the bloc, such as economic and monetary union, free movement of goods and services, free movement of people and a unified market. These benefits cannot simply be replaced by a trade deal with the United States. However, a trade deal with the US may open up new opportunities for the UK, such as access to the world's largest economy, improved access to US markets, and better terms of trade for British manufacturers and services.  A trade deal with America will not be able to compensate Britain for all the benefits it enjoyed as a member of the European Union. A trade deal with the US could open up new markets and create opportunities for Britain, but it cannot replace the access to the European single market, which is the largest in the world. The UK will also lose access to the EU’s political, regulatory and legal framework, and that’s something that a trade deal cannot replace.  No, a trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits. The benefits of EU membership include, but are not limited to, trade under the EU single market, the freedom of movement of people, the free movement of goods and services, the freedom of capital and the ability to access EU funds for research, development and education.

217,No-deal Brexit is back -- and it looks more likely than ever,"['With the UK’s departure from the European Union just three months away, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is increasing. A no-deal Brexit would mean the UK leaves the EU without any agreement on trade, customs, or future relations. This could lead to a chaotic situation, with the imposition of tariffs and customs checks on goods, disruption to the supply of goods and services, and a prolonged period of economic uncertainty. With the UK government and the EU deadlocked on key issues such as the Irish backstop and fishing rights, there is a real risk that the two sides will fail to reach a deal before the end of the transition period in December. This has left many businesses and individuals feeling uncertain and preparing for a no-deal Brexit. There is still hope that a deal can be reached, but for the time being the UK needs to be prepared for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  With Brexit negotiations at an impasse, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has become more and more likely in recent weeks. If the UK and EU fail to agree on a withdrawal agreement before the end of the transition period, the UK will crash out of the EU with no-deal on 31 December 2020.  No-Deal Brexit would mean that the UK would have to trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. This could mean tariffs, quotas and customs checks which could cause chaos at the border, resulting in delays and disruption to the supply chain. It is likely that this would lead to increased prices on imported goods, decreased exports and disruption to the free movements of goods, services, people and money.  The UK government has been taking some steps to mitigate the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit, such as introducing new customs procedures and recruiting additional customs officers. However, it is difficult to know how effective these measures will be without knowing the exact details of the UK’s trading relationship with the EU.  Whether it be no-deal or a deal, Brexit will have a significant impact on the UK economy. It is therefore essential that both the UK and the EU work together to ensure that the transition period is used to minimise the disruption to businesses and citizens alike.']",

Liverpool, who lifted the trophy last season after a dramatic final, had looked almost certain to progress to the quarter-finals after two first-half goals from Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum.  However, the Spanish side fought back in the second half to equalise through Marcos Llorente, before a superb extra-time double from Alvaro Morata saw them complete the turnaround and seal an unlikely victory.

231,How do you beat high-flying Liverpool? Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals all,"['The best way to beat high-flying Liverpool is by staying compact and making sure that you don’t leave too much space between the lines. You must be aware of your positioning and be very disciplined. You should also press Liverpool high up the pitch to win back possession and try to counter-attack quickly. Always be aware of their attacking threats and try to nullify them with good defensive organization and shape. If you can do all of this and take your chances when they come your way, you have every chance of getting a result against Liverpool.  The best way to beat Liverpool is to focus on what you can do well as a team to reduce their attacking threat. This includes keeping a compact defensive shape and pressing Liverpool high up the pitch, forcing their attackers away from your goal. You should also look to limit their time on the ball and deny them space in behind, which would prevent them from creating chances. You should also look to keep hold of possession and build attacks, as this will prevent Liverpool from getting into their rhythm and attacking in numbers. Finally, you should look to score goals whenever a chance presents itself, as this will reduce the pressure on your defence and give you a more positive approach to the game.  The best way to beat high-flying Liverpool is to focus on your own game and play with confidence. With Watford, we focused on playing some very tight, compact defending and counter-attacking when we had the chance. That allowed us to stay in the game and put Liverpool under pressure. As a team, we also worked hard to press Liverpool in areas where they weren't expecting it, which gave us a few opportunities to create chances. From there, it's about taking those chances when you have them. If you can do that, then you can really disrupt and frustrate a team like Liverpool.']",

235,Dealer drops Asian assistant from London art fair due to coronavirus 'anxiety',"['This incident is deeply concerning and unacceptable. It is wrong to discriminate against any person due to their ethnicity, and in this case, it is an extremely misguided reaction to the coronavirus. The virus does not discriminate and everyone should be treated equally, no matter where they are from. This kind of reaction only serves to entrench anxiety and create further divisions. Everyone should be treated with respect, dignity and without prejudice.  This is unacceptable and should be addressed immediately. The health and safety of all individuals is paramount in the art world and any form of discrimination based on national origin, race, or perceived health risk should not be tolerated. The gallery should take steps to review and revise their policies to ensure they are inclusive and respectful of all individuals.  The outbreak of coronavirus has created a wave of panic and anxiety across the world, and unfortunately, this situation has led to a London art fair omitting an Asian assistant from their team.  The fair, which was held in February 2020, was meant to feature an Asian assistant to help the gallery owners, but due to the anxiety and fear surrounding the virus, they decided to drop her from the team.  The gallery owner said that they made the decision out of an abundance of caution, but also said that they are ""very concerned"" about the spread of the virus, and that they had to prioritize the health and safety of the entire team.  The assistant has not been identified, but she was reportedly ""proud"" to have been invited to the art fair and was sad to be excluded due to the virus. The gallery owner apologized for the decision, and said that they hope that the situation will improve soon.  These kinds of decisions, though understandable, are certainly difficult to make, and hopefully this kind of situation can be avoided in the near future.']",
236,Mark Neville's semi-authentic portraits spotlight 'ecotopias' and a forgotten side of France,"['In his semi-authentic portraits, photographer Mark Neville captures a side of France that often goes overlooked. Focusing on the so-called 'ecotopias' of the country—marginalized areas where the traditional values of rural life are still alive—his images capture the people and countryside of these forgotten places. He takes a sensitive, nuanced, and often humorous approach to capturing these forgotten parts of society, showing a side of France that is rarely seen. Through his photographs, Neville hopes to give these people and places the attention they deserve.  The photographic works of British artist Mark Neville focus on “ecotopias,” or the forgotten side of France. His semi-authentic portraits bring to the fore the people, landscapes, and cultures that are often overlooked or ignored by mainstream French society. This series began in 2007, when Neville was asked to be the official photographer of the French National Ecology Week. During his time there, he toured small villages and rural areas of France, noting both the geographical beauty and social issues of the area such as poverty and sensitive topics such as illegal immigration.  Neville’s photographs highlight the unique and often overlooked aspects of French society. By portraying the rural and urban French communities, he is able to bring a universal perspective to the entire country, regardless of social class. His photos capture the everyday life of his subjects while also allowing viewers to appreciate the diverse beauty of the French countryside and its people. Through his semi-authentic portraits, Neville serves as a bridge between the forgotten parts of France and the rest of the nation. He has been able to use his art to raise awareness of issues facing several French communities and hopefully, inspire a sense of empathy and support for them.']",
237,"Biking to work appears more dangerous than other commuting options, study finds","['According to a new study, biking to work can be more dangerous than other forms of commuting. The study, which was published in the British Medical Journal, examined the death rates amongst people who commuted for work by car, metro and bike. The study found that the death rate for cyclists was more than double that of car commuters and more than five times higher than metro commuters. The study also found that the risk of death for cyclists was significantly higher on city roads than on rural roads. Overall, the study concluded that cycling to work on a city road was “significantly more hazardous than commuting by car or metro” and that “cycling safety should be improved through the redesign of road infrastructure.”  A study conducted by researchers from the University of British Columbia has found that biking to work is more dangerous than other commuting options. The researchers studied the commuting patterns of over 17,000 Canadians and found that those who biked to work had an 17 percent higher risk of dying than those who drove and a 23 percent higher risk than those who took public transport. The study also found that the risk of being seriously injured while biking to work was nearly five times greater than for other forms of commuting. The authors of the study suggest that the higher risks associated with biking to work can be reduced through increased infrastructure investment and improved safety education.  According to a study published in the journal Injury Prevention, people who commute to work by bike face a higher risk of injury than those who use other forms of transportation. The study, which included data from over 25,000 participants, found that the risk of serious injury while biking to work was five times higher than the risk of injury while walking or using public transportation. The risk was even higher among cyclists who frequently rode in busy traffic or at night. The authors of the study suggest that cyclists wear protective gear, be aware of their surroundings, and follow the rules of the road to reduce the risk of injury.']",
238,"Quarantines might stop coronavirus, but what happens if people break them?","['If people break quarantine orders, it can increase the risk of spreading the virus to more people. Depending on the severity of the violation, the offender could be subject to fines or other penalties. It is important for those in quarantine to continue following the protocols set forth to minimize the spread of the virus and to protect public health.  If people break the quarantines, then it could cause the spread of the virus to further expand. Quarantines are in place to help contain and prevent the spread of the virus and when they are broken, they may become less effective in preventing illness. People who break their quarantines could be subject to fines and other penalties and face criminal charges in some cases. It is important to follow the quarantine and other safety measures put in place to help contain the virus.   If people break the quarantines, it could lead to a second wave of the coronavirus or even spread the virus to new geographic areas. This could cause an even bigger outbreak than before, particularly if the people who break the quarantine have been exposed to the virus and unknowingly spread it to others. It is essential for people to follow the quarantine regulations in order to prevent the virus from spreading further and avoid a new outbreak.  If people break the quarantine, they may risk spreading the virus to others and potentially cause a renewed surge in cases. Communities may implement stricter measures, such as issuing fines, to ensure that people abide by the quarantine. It is important that everyone follows the quarantine guidelines in order to keep their community and themselves safe.']",
239,How innovative design is reshaping the sex tech industry,"['Innovation in the sex tech industry is driving a wave of new products, services, and experiences. By leveraging the power of design, sex tech companies are creating products that are more comfortable, intuitive and user-friendly. This includes items such as vibrators and lubricants, but also more out-of-the-box products like virtual reality and AI-driven sexual experiences.  Innovative design is also helping companies to create more inclusive products, such as gender-neutral sex toys. Designers are experimenting with different materials and shapes to create products that can be enjoyed by people with various body types and preferences.  In addition to creating more appealing products, innovative design is also making sex tech more discreet. By using smaller and quieter motors, companies are producing items that are easier to transport and use without drawing attention. Designers are also making products easier to clean and store, making them more hygienic and less embarrassing to use.  Overall, innovative design is transforming the sex tech industry by creating more functional and aesthetically pleasing products that are accessible to a wider range of users. This is making sex tech products more acceptable and less taboo, and is changing the way people think about and interact with sex.  Innovation within design is a key factor in the rise of the sex tech industry. The primary focus of innovation within design is to create more user-friendly experiences, improved product efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Innovative designs often come as a result of technological advances, with new 3D printing processes, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) enabling manufacturers to create products that are more realistic, interactive and personalised.  Innovation in design is slowly replacing the traditional methods of sex toy making, such as using plastic or metal, with more flexible and durable materials, like silicone. This is allowing manufacturers to create products that are suited to all kinds of users, regardless of size, shape or preference.  Innovation in design is also enabling manufacturers to create products that focus on personal pleasure. This includes products that feature remote control capabilities, apps that track usage and preferences, and even customised products that are tailored to the user’s body shape and weight.  As the sex tech industry continues to evolve, innovation in design will remain central to the success of the industry. Manufacturers will continue to push the boundaries of design and create products that are more intuitive, efficient, and personalised.']",
240,What the kimono's wide-reaching influence tells us about cultural appropriation,"['The kimono’s wide-reaching influence is a reminder of the power of cultural appropriation. The kimono, which originated in Japan, has had an immense impact on fashion throughout the world, with designers and celebrities embracing the style and incorporating it into their work. This demonstrates how popular culture can take on elements from other cultures and make them its own, sometimes with disastrous effects. Cultural appropriation can lead to the erasure of minority cultures and the marginalization of their members, and it is important to be aware of the implications of our decisions when we use elements of other cultures in our own.  The kimono has had a wide-reaching influence on fashion and design, resulting in it being adopted by people from many cultures. This demonstrates the importance of cultural exchange and the blending of different traditions and practices, which can be seen as a positive example of cultural appropriation. However, it also shows that it is important to consider the context of the original culture when adopting elements from it. In order to avoid disrespecting or misrepresenting the original culture, it is important to research and understand its history and how it is viewed by the culture before appropriating elements from it.  The kimono's wide-reaching influence tells us that cultural appropriation is not a new phenomenon, but one that existed in the past and continues today. The cultural appropriation of the kimono demonstrates the power of cultural exchange, with the design and style of the kimono appearing in numerous cultures worldwide. It also shows how cultural exchange can be a source of inspiration and creative collaboration. At times, cultural appropriation can be a form of cultural appreciation, however, it can also be used to erase and disrespect the culture that it is taken from. As such, cultural appropriation must be done thoughtfully and respectfully, recognizing the significance and contributions that a particular culture has had in shaping the culture we now live in.']",

242,Catherine Opie: 'Beauty has to encompass more about the human condition',"['Catherine Opie is an American photographer, who is best known for her work exploring gender, sexual identity, and community. In her work, Opie captures the full spectrum of human experiences, from the intimate to the political. She believes that “beauty has to encompass more about the human condition” and is focused on exploring the complexity of relationships and identity rather than a singular idea of beauty. Through her photographs, Opie strives to make us think about the fragility and beauty of humanity, no matter the circumstances.  Catherine Opie is an American photographer best known for her portraits and landscapes that explore the complexities of identity, community, and personal relationships. She often captures the beauty of everyday topics and people, such as her series of photographs of her partner, her self-portraits, and her images of the surfers in her local community.  In an interview with Art21, Opie says: “Beauty has to encompass more about the human condition and all of the things that go into that, rather than just being seen as something that is surface and pretty.” She is perhaps best known for her willingness to take risks, pushing notions of beauty within her work and providing viewers with a more honest and candid look at her subjects. Through her work, she seeks to bring attention to issues of gender, race, sexuality, and class while still presenting her subject in a way that is both respectful and beautiful.  Catherine Opie is an American contemporary photographic artist known for her work on portraiture, landscapes, and architecture. She has often used herself as the subject of her photographs, and is known for her explorations of LGBT communities and queer subjectivity.  Opie believes that beauty is far more than just a shallow aesthetic. It is about celebrating the human condition and expressing its complexities. For example, in some of her work she has used her own family and home as a way to explore the complexity of family dynamics and the idea of identity. She has depicted other members of the LGBTQ+ community using her photographs to express a sense of equality and acceptance of individuals regardless of sexual orientation.  Furthermore, she is also known for capturing iconic images of landscapes and architecture - often with a deep amount of emotion - that showcase the beauty of the natural world as well as the human ability to create and inhabit spaces.  Ultimately, Catherine Opie’s work is a celebration of beauty and an exploration of the complexities of the human condition. For her, beauty is far more than just a physical term; it is an idea that encompasses a much deeper sense of self.']",
243,The desexualization of the Asian American male,"['The desexualization of the Asian American male is an issue that has become increasingly evident in popular culture in recent years. This perception of Asian American men has been perpetuated through various sources, including media and film. As Asian Americans become increasingly represented in Hollywood, they have often been portrayed as either asexual nerds, or martial arts masters. These stereotypes have resulted in Asian American men being seen as inadequate or undesirable partners and has resulted in them being desexualized by society.  This desexualization has been linked to a variety of factors, including the fetishization and objectification of Asian women, a lack of positive representation of Asian American male sexuality in popular culture, and a perception of Asian American men as being unattractive or physically weak. Additionally, Asian American men are often racialized, which can contribute to a lack of romantic connections or opportunities. This can prevent Asian American men from being seen as potential life partners and can contribute to the desexualization of Asian American men.  In order to combat this issue, it is essential that Asian American men be positively represented in popular culture and media. This could include showing Asian American men in healthy and fulfilling relationships and depicting them as desirable and sexy partners. Additionally, Asian American men should be empowered to express their sexuality openly, in order to challenge the stereotypes currently in place. This could include Asian American men discussing their experiences in relationships, being open about their sexual orientation, and providing positive role models for other young Asian American men. Ultimately, desexualizing Asian American men is a problem that can only be resolved through positive representation, open dialogue, and collective action.']",
244,"Empowering, alluring, degenerate? The evolution of red lipstick","['Red lipstick has been a symbol of power, opulence, and femininity since ancient times, when Mesopotamian women adorned their lips with shades of red from crushed beetles and flowers. Cleopatra, the notorious last ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, was frequently depicted with a striking red lip. In the 15th century, English actress and famous courtesan Anne Boleyn embraced a bold red lip to convey glamour and sophistication.  Since then, red lipstick has been a symbol of female empowerment throughout many cultures. In the 1920s, iconic movie stars like Clara Bow and Greta Garbo wore red lipstick to represent an alluring and empowering femininity. During the 1950s, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor often donned their signature red lips to express their sexuality.  In the 21st century, red lipstick has become a statement of freedom and liberation. Rather than only being associated with a glamorous lifestyle, the colour has come to be seen as an expression of individuality and self-expression. In 2015, Rihanna released her new cosmetic line, Fenty Beauty, with a range of red shades for all skin tones. This emphasis on alluring shades and pigments for everyone celebrates diversity and encourages self-expression.  However, there has been a darker history to the use of red lipstick. In Chinese culture, the colour has been seen as disgraceful and was even associated with prostitution and adultery. For centuries, the Chinese have frowned upon public displays of red lipstick. In Japan, red lipstick was used as a sign of shame by single women during the 18th century. These associations have since been shifted to be part of a cultural movement calling for women’s emancipation.  In modern times, red lipstick continues to represent a variety of meanings. It can be worn to express fertility, sexuality, femininity, liberation, or self-expression. The colour has become a symbol of power, beauty, and strength, and it is a statement of individual style and femininity that transcends cultures and eras.']",
245,Why women feel pressured to shave,"['their legs  Women feel pressured to shave their legs because of unrealistic beauty standards that set unrealistic expectations for women to meet. Shaving is seen as a ""normal"" part of grooming and if a woman chooses not to shave, she may be judged or made to feel like she is not following the norm. Additionally, media, particularly advertising, often portray female figures as having shaven legs, helping to create and maintain the beauty standard. This pressure can make women feel inadequate or less attractive if they do not shave, leading them to feel the need to conform to the standard.  Women often feel pressure to shave because society has created an expectation that women should have smooth, hairless skin on their body. This expectation is often perpetuated by media, which often portrays women with perfectly smooth and hairless skin. This perpetuates the idea that women should shave, which can cause them to feel an extreme pressure to do so.  Women feel pressured to shave because many people in society hold the belief that women should have smooth, hairless skin in order to be deemed attractive and desirable. This can be seen in the media, with most models and celebrities appearing to have flawlessly smooth skin, which can reinforce this idea of what is considered attractive. This pressure can come from peer groups, family, and even cultural norms, which can create a need for women to conform to these expectations in order to feel accepted and attractive.  Women feel pressured to shave because society has a certain standard of physical beauty that typically associates smooth, hairless skin with youthfulness and femininity. Women are often judged for not meeting this standard and as such feel a pressure to shave or risk being judged or criticized. This pressure is especially strong for women who live in more conservative or traditional societies.']",

In terms of my photography, I have sought to capture the wide range of emotions that Brexit has created, as well as creating images which reflect the hope and optimism which many people have for their future in post-Brexit Britain.  For me, this is an important time to document in British life and history, and it will no doubt provide fascinating material to look back on in the future.  Martin Parr believes that Britain in the age of Brexit is ‘a country in flux’. He believes that the Brexit process has exposed class divisions that have been ignored in the UK for some time and is even more apparent today. He has pointed out that Scotland's attitude to Brexit is very different to England’s and that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. He believes that this could be a ‘catalyst’ for change in the UK, as Scotland could yet decide to become independent.   Parr also believes that Brexit has resulted in a general sense of malaise and uncertainty in people all over the UK, which he has captured in his photography. He notes that people are struggling to remain positive, but there is a feeling of isolation and of a lack of control over the future. He has used his lens to capture the emotions and frustrations of the people of Britain, as well as the growing divisions that have been brought to light by the Brexit debate.']",

255,Olafur Eliasson on what art can do to fight climate change,"['Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental issues we are facing today. Art can play an important role in helping to fight climate change by making people aware of the issue, inspiring action, and helping to create a sense of community and solidarity.  Art can be used to educate people about climate change, as well as make the issue more visible. By creating art that captures the beauty of the natural world and the urgency of the threat of climate change, artists can communicate the science in ways that can be easily understood. Art can also be used to make commentaries on the political and cultural aspects of the issue.  Art can also inspire action, by motivating people to think critically and to come up with creative solutions to climate change. Art can also foster a sense of community and create a space for conversations about sustainability. Finally, art can stimulate dialogue and foster collaboration among people from different backgrounds and perspectives. By doing this, art can help unite people in the fight against climate change.  Art can play a valuable role in tackling climate change by raising awareness of the issue and engaging people’s imaginations. It can provide a platform for discussion about solutions, help contextualise the scientific data, and illustrate the social and environmental implications of climate change. For example, artworks can draw attention to the urgent need for action and bring together scientists, politicians, and communities to collaborate on solutions. Furthermore, art can offer a respite from the anxiety of the climate crisis, showing us visions of a world of possibility and hope.']",

257,Pritzker Prize 2020: Irish duo's win marks rare victory for women in the 'Nobel of architecture',"['The 2020 Pritzker Prize has been awarded to the Irish duo Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell. This marks a rare victory for women architects in the “Nobel of Architecture”, which has only been awarded to four women previous to this year.  McNamara and Farrell are the founders of GRAFTON Architects, located in Dublin, and have worked together since 1978. Their practice focuses on “humanized design”, and has been recognized for its thoughtful and dignified approach to modern architecture.  GRAFTON Architects has designed a number of notable projects over the years, including the Bocconi University in Milan and the University of Limerick Medical School. The pair are also well known for their research on urbanism and cities, including their lecture series entitled “City in the Making” at Harvard Graduate School of Design.  The selection of McNamara and Farrell for the Pritzker Prize marks a momentous occasion for women in architecture and design. The Pritzker Prize is arguably the highest honor in the field, and the award of this prestigious award to two women marks a major shift in the recognition of women architects. The Pritzker committee has stated that their selection of McNamara and Farrell reflects the organization’s commitment to “recognizing talent without prejudice or bias”.  The 2020 Pritzker Prize, considered the top honors in architecture, has gone to Irish architects Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, a rare win for women in the traditionally male-dominated field.  The Pritzker Prize was established in 1979 by the late Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy, to honor a living architect whose built work demonstrates a combination of talent, vision and commitment, according to the prize's website. This year's winners have been credited for their modern buildings that incorporate physical contexts and cultural conditions, such as social and historical references in their projects.  Farrell and McNamara are founding members of Grafton Architects, a Dublin-based practice they established in 1978. They are the first female duo to win the award, and the first Irish architects to receive the honor in its 41-year history. Farrell and McNamara worked together on projects such as the Universita Luigi Bocconi in Milan, the Viderum Education Centre in Croatia and the UTEC University in Lima, Peru.  The pair have been praised for their minimal yet highly efficient designs in projects across Europe, Africa and South America that have put social context at the forefront of their approach. This is in sharp contrast to the large-scale, expensive, often whimsical and even gaudy designs favored by some of their peers.  Farrell and McNamara's win sends an important message to the architecture world. In a profession long dominated by men, their win proves that talented women can be just as successful as their male colleagues. The Pritzker Prize not only recognizes the best of architectural design but also serves to expose the world to new approaches to architecture and new voices in the profession.']",

However, it is unlikely that the future will be entirely dependent on them.  No, the future will not be grown from mushrooms. Although mushrooms are an important part of a healthy diet and can provide many benefits to the body, they are not capable of growing a complete future.  It is possible to grow certain materials, such as mycelium, from mushrooms, however it is unlikely that mushroom technology will replace traditional building materials in the near future. There is still much research to be done in this field and although mushrooms may be used to supplement traditional construction materials, it is unlikely they will be relied upon as the primary building material.  It is possible that the future might contain elements grown from mushrooms. For example, mushrooms could be used to create new sustainable materials and food sources. Additionally, scientists are looking into using mushrooms to create greener energy sources, like biofuels or energy harvesting. So while it is not certain that the future will include these new mushroom-based sources, there is potential for them to become a larger part of our lives in the future.

263,Mona Lisa for $60K? The curious market for Old Masters replicas,"['The market for Old Masters replicas has grown over the last few years, fueled in part by the increasing popularity of online art sales. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of buyers paying large sums of money for replicas of famous artworks, such as the Mona Lisa.  One example of the growing interest in replicas was an online auction of a Mona Lisa replica that sold for $60,000 in 2017. The painting had been created by an Italian art restorer and included a certificate of authenticity.  The fact that someone was willing to pay such a large sum of money for a replica underscores the increasingly important role that replicas can play in the art market. For many buyers, a replica may offer a way to enjoy a piece of art without the steep price tag associated with an original work.  The growing popularity of replicas has also created a demand for skilled art forgers, who can replicate masterpieces with near-perfect accuracy. While this is not illegal in most countries, it does carry a moral and ethical cost due to the potential for buyers to be misled about the identity of the artwork.  While the market for Old Masters replicas may be a lucrative one for some, buyers should be aware of the risks associated with procuring a replica and research the source of the painting they are purchasing. For those looking to purchase an original work of art, it is always best to purchase from a reputable source.']",

266,Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes,"['Seoul's drag scene is experiencing a growing presence in the city, despite the country's conservative social attitudes towards LGBTQIA+ communities. Despite this, the scene is growing in popularity, particularly among female and non-binary individuals. Drag performers in Seoul have begun to hold their own shows, events and parties to give visibility to the LGBTQIA+ community. These performances are a great way of expressing their identities and bringing visibility to the struggles they face in South Korea's increasingly repressive environment.  Drag in Seoul has also provided a platform for queer visibility through social media, with performers regularly uploading content to platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. This has provided a platform for members of the queer community to express themselves and spread awareness of the issues they face, while also helping to build a strong supportive network of allies who seek to create a more inclusive society.  Overall, Seoul's drag scene is still in its early stages and has yet to gain full acceptance and recognition within South Korean society. Nevertheless, its growing presence in the city is an indication of an increasingly open and progressive attitude towards the LGBTQIA+ community and the rights they deserve.  Seoul’s drag scene is rapidly growing as a visible, legitimate nightlife option for youth and adults in the city, though it continues to face pushback from conservative attitudes toward LGBTQIA+ expression and rights in South Korea. Though there is also a long history of drag performance in the city, recent years have seen a huge increase in publicly visible drag events, particularly in Seoul’s Hongdae neighborhood.  On one hand, drag performers in the city are pushing against the boundaries and stigma of gender expression, sexual orientation, and entertainment. On the other, they face pressure from the public and government agencies to maintain an image of respectability and control over their performances. This tension has led to a range of reactions – both positive and negative – from the general public and from LGBTQIA+ communities.  Proponents of the drag scene view it as beneficial to LGBTQIA+ individuals, as well as a vibrant part of the city’s nightlife that can bring people of all backgrounds together in celebration. South Korean media, such as KBS, have also highlighted drag performances, particularly those that emphasize respect for transgender individuals.  Opponents, however, condemn the scene for its perceived disrespect for gender norms and for propagating a negative image of transgender people in South Korea. Seoul’s conservative mayor, Park Wonsoon, has been highly critical of the drag scene, claiming that it “violates traditional gender norms.”  Drag shows in Seoul are becoming increasingly popular as the city's LGBTQIA+ community continues to seek acceptance and visibility. While the scene faces significant pushback from conservative attitudes, it continues to gain momentum and grow as a legitimate nightlife option for youth and adults in the city.']",

268,Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"['Brazil's fashion industry is known for its diversity and vibrant colors, with many of the country's top fashion brands relying heavily on diverse models and styles to promote their products. However, the industry is still behind in terms of effective representation of Brazil's ethnic diversity. Despite Brazil being a racially mixed society, with over half of the population having ancestral roots outside of Europe, fashion is still largely dominated by models of European origin. This lack of racial diversity affects not only the models and designers, but also the entire fashion industry, from the production process to the marketing strategies used.  Fortunately, there are some fashion companies who are trying to make a change. For example, the fashion and lifestyle brand Osklen recently launched an ‘Osklen X Brazil’ campaign, which aimed to better represent the multicultural reality of Brazil. Additionally, a number of Brazilian models, photographers and designers are using their platforms to promote a more inclusive fashion industry. As the industry continues to grow, hopefully more brands will join in and help create a more diverse and inclusive fashion industry.. While the Brazilian fashion market is growing, there is a lack of inclusion. Many indigenous and Afro-Brazilian cultures are not represented in the fashion industry, and this lack of representation has led to a lack of diversity among designers, models, and other fashion professionals. Additionally, there is a lack of intersectional and sustainable fashion practices. In recent years, efforts have been made to create a more inclusive fashion industry by involving more diverse designers, and by implementing eco-friendly practices, ethically sourced materials, and workshops that focus on inclusivity and sustainability.']",
269,How did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes-Benzes? New report traces origin of North Korea's luxury rides,"['Kim Jong Un's Mercedes-Benzes were primarily purchased through a network of sanctioned trading companies in China that buy and sell luxury cars and accessories to North Korean officials. The cars are then brought into the country through unofficial channels. Reports suggest that the vehicles were originally intended to be used by Chinese government officials, but were re-sold to North Korean officials instead. In some cases, the cars were even brought directly into North Korea from China. The trading companies involved in the transactions often used false identities and documents to ensure that the cars were not traced back to the North Korean government.  According to a 2016 report by The International Institute of Strategic Studies, North Korea's Mercedes-Benz cars were likely obtained through a variety of channels, including illicit procurement networks with links to the country’s military-run elites, generous gifts from foreign visitors, the sale of coal and other resources abroad, and other methods. Reports also suggest that North Korea has sought to manufacture its own Mercedes-style cars, though these are not in widespread use.  According to a new report by United Nations independent experts, many of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles owned by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are supplied by China, with some reportedly being purchased from used car dealerships in Russia. The independent experts compiled the report for a UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions on North Korea.   The report did not determine the exact number of Mercedes-Benz vehicles owned by Kim Jong Un, but said it was likely to be around 30. The vehicles include older, less expensive models.  The report said that China is the primary source of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles, while other vehicles, such as Toyota SUV’s, come from sources in Malaysia, Mongolia and possibly Russia. The report said that the vehicles may have been acquired through either back-channel transactions or smuggling and that some of the vehicles may have been refurbished in China before being shipped to North Korea.

The building has caused controversy since beginning construction in 1987 because of its size and lack of progress.  The Ryugyong Hotel was planned to be the world’s tallest hotel, and was expected to have over 3,000 rooms, seven revolving restaurants and a casino. The building was intended to be a symbol of North Korea’s power and prestige, but the project ran into difficulties almost immediately.  Construction was delayed multiple times, with the building standing empty for over 16 years. In 2008, the project was revived, with a newly designed glass facade. However, the building remains unfinished.  The main reason for the delays and lack of progress is North Korea’s lack of funds and resources. Due to international sanctions and trade embargoes, North Korea has been unable to secure sufficient materials, equipment, and manpower to complete the hotel. Additionally, the North Korean economy has been in decline over the past few decades, making it difficult to fund such a large-scale project.  Despite the building’s unfinished state, the Ryugyong Hotel has become a symbol of the country’s ongoing economic and political struggles. The “Hotel of Doom” stands as a reminder of the challenges North Korea has faced over the years.

The hotel is estimated to have cost over $750 million to build and is the tallest unoccupied building in the world. Its unique pyramid design, which includes seven revolving floors and a rotating restaurant near the top of the building, has earned it the nickname ‘Hotel of Doom’.  In 2008, work resumed on the building and plans were made to open the hotel in 2011 and it was finally completed in 2012. However, the building has never been open to the public, leading some to speculate that it is still unfinished.

272,The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car,"['The designer behind the DeLorean and James Bond's famous underwater car was American engineer and industrialist, Bill Collins.  Collins was the chief engineer of John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company and was responsible for the design of the iconic DeLorean DMC-12 car, which featured prominently in the Back to the Future film series. Collins also designed James Bond's Amphicar 780, an amphibious car used in the 1977 movie, The Spy Who Loved Me.  Collins died in 1985, at the age of 68, but his contributions to the automotive industry live on in the two iconic cars that he designed.  The man behind these two iconic cars was Giorgetto Giugiaro, an Italian automotive designer who made a name for himself as one of the design masters of the 20th century. Giugiaro’s designs were sought after by the world’s leading car makers, including Fiat, Volkswagen, BMW, and Maserati, and are credited with ushering in a new era in the industry, one increasingly shaped by design. He was also responsible for the design of the DeLorean DMC-12 and the Lotus Espirit S1 car featured in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me.  The late Ken Adam was the unsung car designer who created the DeLorean time machine for the Back to the Future franchise, and the innovative underwater Lotus Esprit in The Spy Who Loved Me. Adam was born in Berlin in 1921, and his family moved to England when he was 14. In the 1940s he joined the British film industry, eventually rising to become production designer for Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove and Barry Lyndon.

273,Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"[', as different groups and communities have their own fashion sensibilities and customs. As such, fashion gaffes are often an unintentional sign of disrespect for those cultures, and can lead to feelings of exclusion or alienation. To avoid such gaffes, fashion designers, brands, and media outlets should strive to create more inclusive designs and styles, as well as provide representation of diverse cultures in their marketing efforts. Additionally, public figures and celebrities should use their influence to showcase a more diverse range of personal style, rather than only adhering to current trends. Finally, individuals should seek out cultural education, so they can understand the cultural influences and norms that inform fashion styles from around the world.. The fashion industry has long been criticized for its lack of diversity and its failure to adequately represent different demographics in its advertisements, models, and designs. This lack of diversity can cause fashion gaffes, such as inappropriate imagery or insensitive language, to go unnoticed. These gaffes can be damaging to the fashion industry, as they may cause consumers to feel excluded or disrespected. As the industry grows and becomes more diverse, fashion gaffes should become less frequent and more easily corrected.  Fashion gaffes are sadly a reflection of the diversity problem that still exists in the industry. Despite recent progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in fashion, there is still a significant lack of representation of people of different backgrounds, abilities, identities and body types in the industry. This lack of representation means that fashion designers, marketers and other players in the industry are often creating products and campaigns that don't accurately reflect the needs or wants of customers or potential customers. This lack of representation often leads to fashion gaffes, which can range from offensive missteps to just not accurately meeting customer needs. To address this problem, the fashion industry must make concerted efforts to promote and celebrate diversity and inclusion, and recognize the value of diverse perspectives.']",
274,Battle of Supremes: How 'legal fakes' are challenging a $1B brand,"['The ""legal fakes"" that are challenging a billion dollar brand are counterfeit clothing items that use certain logos and designs from major clothing brands. These items are not actually produced or authorized by the brand in question and often use lower quality materials. The legal fakes are sold in places such as flea markets, street vendors, and even online marketplaces for significantly lower prices. This has made the items more accessible to consumers and a great deal more profitable to the sellers, creating a ""gray"" market in which the original brand's legitimacy is compromised.  The brand affected by the legal fakes is often unable to act as counterfeiting is illegal and can be hard to prove. Additionally, there are court costs and time involved in ensuring that the rights of the brand are being upheld. As such, the brand's legal team must decide whether it is worth the effort and cost of pursuing a potential counterfeiting case.  In the United States, the Supreme brand has become a victim of legal fakes. The brand's logo and other design elements have been copied and used on many counterfeit items, which has hurt the brand's reputation and caused lost sales. The brand has taken the issue of counterfeit goods very seriously and has worked with local law enforcement and even the United States Department of Justice to take legal action against those involved in the illegal activity.  The battle of Supremes is an ongoing battle between brands and counterfeiters, as brands continue to fight to protect their intellectual property. In the end, it is up to the consumer to make sure they are purchasing authentic and legitimate items. By doing so, consumers can ensure that the brand's reputation is upheld and their money is not wasted on something that is not what it seems.']",

278,The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars,"['Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a much-loved Supreme Court Justice who was an icon for gender equality and other progressive causes. She was also known for her sartorial flair and for wearing decorative collars with her judicial robes. This soft power impact of her collars was both intentional and unintentional.   Intentionally, the iconic collars created a connection between Ginsburg and the public. She had a long history of supporting progressive causes and the public viewed her collars as a sign of her commitment to these causes. As a result, Ginsburg's collars became a symbol of progressivism and gender equality for many people.  Unintentionally, Ginsburg's collars also brought attention to the fact that justices can choose to express themselves in the way they dress. This encouraged other judges, both men and women, to express themselves in similar ways, creating a more diverse and accepting judicial system.  Finally, Ginsburg's collars had a soft power impact on her votes. Ginsburg's collars connected her to the public, and this connection likely influenced the way in which she casted her votes. This connection likely impacted how she viewed cases, and how she felt she could best serve the public. As Ginsburg herself said, the collars she wore “represent the many women who came before me and the many who will come after.”  Ruth Bader Ginsburg's personal decorative collars were one of the most iconic and beloved aspects of her legacy. The colorful, overstated collars were a visual reminder of her approach to dissent and justice, and a symbol of her distinct yet powerful sense of style. Her collars served a greater purpose as well; they were a form of soft power, conveying her identity and her commitment to justice without any words or grandiose gestures. By wearing these collars, Ginsburg was able to spread her message of equal rights and justice to a much broader audience. The collars became a symbol of her unwavering commitment to social justice and her soft power extended beyond her physical life.']",

Throughout this period, many individuals and groups contributed to the cause in different ways. Thanks to vintage photography, many forgotten women—and a few men—are now being celebrated for the roles they played in advancing the right to vote for women.  These unsung heroes include small business owners, reformers, politicians, activists, and educators, among others. Their contributions were often humble, if not unrecognized, but they helped to shape history and achieve a great victory for women’s rights. Here are some of their powerful stories and inspiring faces.   Harriot Stanton Blatch Harriot Stanton Blatch was a staunch suffragist and one of the leading activists of the US suffrage movement. She is credited with organizing the first modern suffrage parade in New York City in 1912. Blatch later founded the Women’s Political Union and served on the executive board of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).  Mother Hull Mother Lucy Ella Anthony Hull was a reformer and activist who was heavily involved in the US suffrage movement. She founded the Women’s Franchise League in Ohio in 1895 and worked with local suffrage organizations to organize parades, rallies, and protests to draw attention to the cause.

287,El Helicoide: The futuristic wonder that now sums up Venezuela's spiral into despair,"['The Helicoide is an ambitious architectural project that was intended to serve as an elite shopping mall in Venezuela. Designed by prominent Venezuelan architect Roberto Ceballos, it was completed in the late 1950s and is located in the Caracas neighbourhood of El Carrizal. Despite its impressive design, the mall never opened due to financial problems and construction issues. With the decline of the Venezuelan economy and the increasing authoritarianism of the government, the Helicoide was instead transformed into a prison for those accused of speaking out against the government. The Helicoide, which is owned by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service, quickly became a symbol of the oppressive and inhumane conditions experienced by those imprisoned there. Although its prisoners were released in 2018, the Helicoide remains a stark reminder of the struggles that Venezuela is facing and a warning of the dangers of authoritarian rule.  Once a shining symbol of Venezuela's futuristic aspirations, the Helicoide is a towering landmark in Caracas that has become a tragic symbol of the country's descent into crisis and despair. Planned in the 1950s as a giant shopping mall, the structure was intended to evoke the modern and progressive spirit of Venezuela. However, its current form is much darker: the building has been repurposed into a prison, holding thousands of opponents of President Nicolás Maduro's regime in what the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called a ""torture center"".  The Helicoide has suffered much neglect in recent years; its halls are now full of overcrowding, broken toilets, and unsanitary conditions. Inmates report being beaten and denied access to basic healthcare. The prison has become a symbol of the systemic human rights violations and deteriorating economic conditions that plague Venezuela. It stands as a stark reminder of the government's failure to protect its citizens, as well as of the far-reaching consequences of economic mismanagement and political repression.  The Helicoide embodies the severe challenges facing the Venezuelan people today. It is a powerful reminder of the lack of opportunity and security in the country, as well as of how far the nation has fallen in such a short period of time. Its current role as a prison for political dissidents and its rusted, crumbling walls serve as a stark metaphor for the brokenness and despair of the Venezuelan people.']",
288,Savers are getting destroyed by super low interest rates,"['Savers are struggling in the current environment of ultra-low interest rates. Most banks and other financial institutions are offering close to zero percent interest rates on savings accounts. This makes it nearly impossible for savers to earn a meaningful rate of return by keeping their money in the bank. In addition, inflation has been running higher than interest rates, resulting in a further erosion of savers' purchasing power. As a result, many savers have been forced to look for alternative investments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to generate a better return.  Low interest rates have had a devastating effect on savers. Since the Federal Reserve began lowering rates in 2008, savers that used to be able to earn a decent yield on their deposits have seen those yields drop to nearly zero. This has caused the savings rate to fall to its lowest level since the 1950s. This is particularly damaging for those living on fixed incomes, as they are unable to take on the risks of investing in order to generate returns. The only way to make up for the lost interest income is to find other ways to save money, such as trimming expenses or increasing income.  Low interest rates have a crippling effect on savers, as they make it difficult to accumulate savings at an adequate rate of return. Historically, savers have relied on interest-bearing accounts to help them build savings. But with interest rates currently hovering near all-time lows, savers have seen their returns plummet. With no other options, savers have had to move their money into riskier investments such as stocks in order to find returns that make saving worthwhile. Unfortunately, these investments are not always successful, leaving savers with fewer resources to build their savings.']",
289,Delta announces its biggest flight capacity cuts in history -- even deeper than after 9/11,"['Delta Air Lines announced that it will be cutting 40% of its flight capacity in April and May of 2020, due to the COVID-19 health crisis. According to Delta CEO Ed Bastian, this is the largest capacity cut in the company’s 88-year history — even deeper than the cuts the airline made in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  The cuts will include a 60% reduction in international flights, and domestic flights will be cut by 20%. The airline will also be suspending certain routes, including international routes between the U.S. and Europe, Latin America, and Asia.  The measures are part of Delta’s effort to respond to the drastic fall in demand for airline travel since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for air travel in the US has decreased by an estimated 80%, cutting into the airline’s revenues. In addition to the capacity cuts, the airline is also taking measures such as suspending ticket sales and eliminating ticket change fees.  Delta’s decision is part of a broader trend among airlines, as they adjust to the low demand environment created by the pandemic. Other airlines have announced similar measures, with United Airlines and American Airlines cutting capacity by 50% and 40% respectively.  Delta Air Lines announced on June 11, 2020 that it is making its biggest flight capacity cuts in its history. The airline will be reducing its schedule by 40% for July and August 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. This is even deeper than the cuts made following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The majority of the cuts are for domestic flights and are due to the impact of the coronavirus on travel demand. Delta is also suspending dozens of international routes and reducing the size of its fleet in order to minimize costs. The airline hopes that these measures will help it rebound quicker when the pandemic subsides.']",
290,The great shutdown of 2020: How newsrooms and media companies are adapting,"['The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on newsrooms and media companies around the world. In 2020, many have had to shut down completely or switch to remote operations in order to protect employees, cut costs and adjust to the new reality.   In the United States, newsrooms have made deep cuts to staff, eliminated jobs and implemented furloughs. Many newsrooms and media companies have also had to reduce printed publication frequency or shift to entirely digital operations. Many publishers have also had to pivot their content strategy to adjust to the new climate and focus on topics like healthcare, the economy and remote working.  In response to the pandemic, many media companies have shifted their reliance to digital platforms. For example, some publishers have moved their subscription models to digital-only formats and utilized video streaming services such as YouTube and Facebook Live for televised programming.   Additionally, publishers have had to focus on building online user engagement and boosting traffic across their digital platforms. Companies are using strategies such as newsletters, social media campaigns, and paywalls to drive engagement and monetize their content.

The great shutdown of 2020 has had a dramatic effect on newsrooms and media companies large and small, and it has forced them to make fast and huge changes to the way they operate. From large media conglomerates to small, independent journalists, the shift to digital has been huge.  Many newsrooms have had to downsize or even lay off staff, which has forced them to reevaluate the way they do business. In response, many newsrooms have begun to explore ways of leveraging the digital space to reach their audience. That has meant embracing social media, most notably given the reach and accessibility it offers, as well as using video and other formats to deliver their news.  In addition, many newsrooms are also focused on creating digital-first products, such as apps and other interactive content, that can be accessed easily and quickly by an audience looking for breaking news and analysis.  Finally, many media companies are examining how to monetize digital content, and turn the pivot to digital into a more sustainable long-term strategy. This includes things like creating premium content, introducing subscriptions, and finding ways to monetize their digital presence.  At the end of the day, the great shutdown of 2020 has forced many newsrooms and media companies to re-imagine the way they do business. But with the right strategies in place, they may be able to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.']",

This marked a major shift in the company's supply chain, which had long relied on frozen beef patties.

McDonald’s began by developing a new cooking method for its Quarter Pounder and Signature Crafted Recipe burgers, ensuring that the fresh beef patties reach the desired internal temperature during cooking. The company also worked to upgrade restaurant equipment and processes to handle the fresh beef, and engaged suppliers to provide high quality, consistent fresh beef delivery.

McDonald’s also retrained staff so that they could properly cook, handle, and store fresh beef patties.  In addition, McDonalds had to modify its restaurant processes to accommodate the fresh beef. This involved adjusting cooking times and temperatures, as well as changing the way the burgers are prepared and served.

295,Bitcoin has lost 30% of its value this week,"['The cryptocurrency market has seen wild volatility over the past week, with Bitcoin (BTC) losing over 30% of its value during that period. The drop appears to be driven by speculation that Tesla CEO Elon Musk could begin selling the company's Bitcoin holdings and that US regulators could take additional action against cryptocurrency exchanges. Other factors may have contributed to the steep decline, including recent news reports indicating that the US Treasury Department is considering stricter rules for digital asset transfers and increased fears of a global economic slowdown.  Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset, and 30% swings in price in a week or even a day are not uncommon.

309,How facial recognition went from bad TV to Big Brother,"['Facial recognition technology has come a long way since its early days in the 1980s when it was used as a novelty on television shows. Today, the technology is being used everywhere from airports to schools to retail stores. It’s become so pervasive that it has sparked fears of a “Big Brother”-esque surveillance state.  The technology works by scanning a face and then comparing it to a database of images. If it finds a match, it will then return the information that was linked to that face. This can include names, addresses, social media profiles, and more.  Facial recognition has been used by law enforcement and government agencies as a powerful way to identify criminals and terrorists. However, the technology has also come under fire for its potential for abuse and its implications for privacy rights.  Many countries, such as the US, UK, and China, have passed laws that restrict the use of facial recognition for security purposes. In some cases, those laws even mandate that citizens be notified when their face is scanned.  Despite these restrictions, facial recognition is increasingly being used for commercial, rather than security, applications. Retail stores are using the technology to track customer movements and facial expressions, while banks are using it to verify identities and detect fraud.  So while facial recognition technology may have started as a novelty on TV, it has now become a tool that has the potential to be used for both good and bad. As the technology advances, it’s up to governments, businesses, and individuals to ensure that the technology is used responsibly.']",
310,How a coronavirus 'infodemic' is infecting the internet,"['The coronavirus pandemic has sparked an “infodemic”—a term the World Health Organization (WHO) has been using to describe the avalanche of conflicting and inaccurate information circulating about the virus on social media and other digital platforms. Unverified reports about the virus and its effects have filled the internet, including false cures and treatments, panic, rumors of conspiracies, and even wild claims that the outbreak was created in a laboratory.  This flood of misinformation can have real-world implications as people look to the internet for answers, an issue that was perhaps no more visible than at the start of the pandemic when incorrect advice about the use of face masks swept the web. The WHO has since been working to correct misinformation, issuing guidelines, and also working with social media companies and other stakeholders to fight the spread of false information.  The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in an “infodemic” – an unprecedented spread of misinformation, speculation and conspiracy theories about the virus and its causes, treatments, and prevention. This is as damaging as it is dangerous, and has become more rampant as the pandemic progresses.  The infodemic has spread largely through social media, where rumors and false claims about the virus are shared rapidly and widely. Some of the false information involves the origins of the virus and conspiracy theories about who is responsible for it. Other misinformation involves how it is spread, treatments that are available, and ways to protect oneself from infection.  The infodemic has been exacerbated by the fact that many of the sources of information have been untrustworthy and have failed to properly verify the accuracy of claims. This has resulted in a surge of false or misleading information, much of which has been shared without context or scrutiny.  In order to combat the spread of this “infodemic,” it is important to ensure that the information being shared is reliable and accurate. People should seek out trusted sources of information, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, it is important to be aware of and avoid sharing false information, as this can lead to further confusion and panic.']",
311,"The 'retail apocalypse,' explained","['The term “retail apocalypse” refers to the decline of the traditional retail sector in the United States and other Western countries due to the rise of online shopping, changes in consumer habits, and the growth of e-commerce. This decline has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, as many retailers were forced to close their stores and make the shift to e-commerce. Brick-and-mortar businesses that are unable to make the switch are facing an increasingly tough environment as shoppers move online and embrace new digital-first shopping experiences. The retail apocalypse has had a dramatic effect on the American job market, as hundreds of thousands of retail workers have been laid off as a result of store closures. It has also had a significant economic impact, as lost retail sales have reduced tax revenue in many states and cities.  The “retail apocalypse” is a term used to describe a phenomenon where retail stores, particularly brick-and-mortar stores, are closing in large numbers due to shifts in consumer behavior, technological advances, and a challenging macroeconomic environment. The trend began in the early 2000s, but has accelerated in recent years. Reasons for store closings include the rise of e-commerce, a lack of consumer spending, and stagnation of wages. Additionally, rising costs of doing business—such as rent, labor, and inventory—have put pressure on many retailers to reduce their number of stores. Many iconic brands, including Toys R Us and Sears, have been casualties of the retail apocalypse. The effects of the retail apocalypse have been felt most deeply in suburban malls and shopping centers, where store closures have resulted in job losses and lower tax revenue.']",

323,How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"['NASA's Apollo program, which put a man on the moon in 1969, was a major technological achievement and kickstarted the modern technology revolution of Silicon Valley. It encouraged the world’s leading engineers and scientists to develop and invent new technologies. Computers were the primary tool used to control and monitor the spacecraft, as well as to calculate launch and landing trajectories. This technology was then adapted and further developed, making it possible to create more complex computer systems and networks.   The Apollo program also allowed scientists to develop new materials, such as titanium and carbon fiber, that are now widely used in modern technology. Additionally, semiconductors, which are used to build the circuitry for computer chips and other electronic devices, owe their development in part to the Apollo program.   The scientists and engineers who worked on the Apollo program inspired a generation of tech entrepreneurs who went on to found some of the most iconic tech companies in Silicon Valley. Companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all been inspired by the work done by the Apollo program.   NASA’s operations in Silicon Valley also helped to create a culture that encourages innovation and risk taking, which is now a cornerstone of the tech industry. This is why Silicon Valley remains the epicenter of the tech revolution and the birthplace of some of the world’s most innovative companies.   NASA's Apollo program, which successfully put a man on the moon in 1969, was one of the major catalysts that caused the tech boom of the 1970s. By investing in the development of cutting-edge technologies, the Apollo program increased the demand for talented engineers and scientists in the nascent Silicon Valley. This provided the perfect environment for tech giants like Apple, Intel, and HP to flourish.  The tech explosion of the 1970s was further fueled by a series of 'spinoff' programs created by NASA to commercialize the technologies it developed for the Apollo program. The spinoff programs, such as the Small Business Innovation Research program, allowed small businesses to apply for research and development grants from NASA. These grants allowed these small businesses to develop products based on the same space-age technologies used in Apollo missions, such as integrated circuits and miniaturized electronic components.  The success of the Apollo program also encouraged companies to invest in research and development. This allowed them to build on the foundations of the Apollo program and develop new products. For example, Intel's co-founders, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, developed the basis of the modern computer by creating the integrated circuit.  The Apollo program's influence on tech can still be seen today. Many of the products and technologies used in modern life can be traced back to the Apollo program, such as satellite TV and communications, solar cells, CAT scans, and NASA's current research into artificial intelligence. It's clear that NASA's Apollo program was the spark that ignited Silicon Valley's amazing tech revolution.']",

It is also believed that selling his Amazon stock will give Bezos more flexibility to focus on Blue Origin, which has been a longtime passion project for him.  It appears that Jeff Bezos has sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock for personal reasons. He stated that the sale was part of his long-term approach to financial planning. This is likely due to his future plans to diversify his investments and possibly purchase new business ventures and investments. The sale is not a sign of a lack of confidence in Amazon, but is most likely simply a personal financial decision, as Bezos is worth around $177 billion.

The money from the sale was likely used for investments and other personal uses rather than for Amazon-related expenses. Bezos is the wealthiest person in the world, and this sale is likely just one of many investments he is making to diversify his wealth.  The timing of the sale could also be related to Amazon's stock price. Amazon stock recently hit a new all-time high and the company is expected to report strong earnings in its upcoming report, making this a good time to sell stock.   In addition, Amazon is currently in the middle of an antitrust investigation which may have prompted Bezos to sell a portion of his stock while it is still worth a great deal of money.  In any case, the sale of Jeff Bezos' stock is likely part of a larger plan to diversify his wealth and capitalize on Amazon's recent success.']",
325,Bill Nye's experimental spacecraft that sails on sunlight declares mission success,"['The ""LightSail"" spacecraft, created by Bill Nye's Planetary Society, has declared mission success after successfully navigating using solar sails. Launched earlier this year, the spacecraft uses sails made of ultra-thin material to generate thrust from the pressure of sunlight. The sails capture photons that bounce off the spacecraft, pushing it forward.  In recent weeks, the LightSail spacecraft has been sending back data that demonstrates that it is indeed able to move as a result of ""solar sailing,"" as opposed to simply drifting along with the solar wind.  ""We’ve been able to demonstrate LightSail’s ability to successfully orient and guide itself through space using the force of sunlight, the same force that powers life on Earth and drives our planet through its orbit around the Sun,"" said Bill Nye, CEO of The Planetary Society.  This successful mission marks a major milestone in the field of solar sailing, which relies upon a revolutionary new form of propulsion that can take advantage of the Sun's energy. The Planetary Society plans to use this technology to explore the outer reaches of our solar system and beyond.  Bill Nye's experimental spacecraft, LightSail 2, has declared mission success! After launching on June 25, 2019, the experimental spacecraft began its journey through space propelled only by the pressure of light from the sun. On July 23, LightSail 2 completed its primary mission, traveling more than 1 million miles and demonstrating that a spacecraft can use the pressure of sunlight for propulsion.   This mission marks a major milestone for Planetary Society and space exploration. Solar sailing has been discussed for decades, but until now, the technology has never been fully implemented. LightSail 2 has changed that and has demonstrated the potential of solar sailing as a viable and cost-effective form of propulsion for deep space exploration.  The success of LightSail 2 has given Planetary Society members and space exploration enthusiasts hope that this technology could be used to explore the distant reaches of the solar system—and beyond.']",

The sport rose to an altitude of 10 kilometers before returning to the ground in a controlled descent and exploding as it attempted to land. This test was the first time a Starship prototype had flown to such a high altitude, containing a full tank of liquid oxygen and methane propellants. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk boasted that the prototype had “exceeded expectations” and the success of the mission is an important step in the development of the Starship, which is planned to be the first reusable launch vehicle capable of carrying humans to Mars. in high-altitude flight test  On December 9, 2020, SpaceX's Starship prototype SN8 launched from SpaceX's development facility in Boca Chica, Texas, in its first high-altitude flight test. The prototype reached an altitude of 41,000 feet (12.5 kilometers) before performing a complex series of maneuvers and flipping itself into a vertical landing position. It then deployed its landing leg flaps and touched down in a large cloud of dust. While the flight itself was a success, a few seconds after touchdown, the prototype exploded due to a methane fuel leak. The Starship program is part of SpaceX's ongoing effort to develop a fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit rocket system capable of carrying 100 metric tons of payload into orbit.  On December 9th, 2020, SpaceX launched its massive Starship prototype, SN8, from the company's testing facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The launch was a milestone for SpaceX, as it marked the first time the company used its full-scale prototype for a flight test.  The 165-foot-tall SN8 prototype lifted off from its launch mount and climbed to nearly 40,000 feet, before it descended and flipped itself in an aerodynamic maneuver known as a ""belly flop"" and then reigniting its three Raptor engines to slow its descent.  After the successful test flight, Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, declared that it was a ""success"" despite the fact that the prototype failed to stick its landing and exploded upon impact.']",
327,Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"['with a new Internet-connected 'smart soil'  Kimbal Musk, entrepreneur and younger brother of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, recently announced his plan to revolutionize farming through smart soil technology. The technology, called ""The Farm"" uses sensors and an internet connection to measure and monitor the health of soil health. Data is collected and analyzed in real time, with detail such as soil’s pH levels, water content, and temperature all tracked. This data allows farmers to make decisions on what should be planted and how they should be grown and watered, resulting in higher yields and better crop quality. Kimbal hopes the technology will be adopted by farmers across the world and says it will be available in the next year or two.  Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, is looking to transform the way we farm by introducing vertical farming. Vertical farming is a system of growing food indoors in layers, usually within a controlled environment. Since the system does not require the use of soil and relies on an artificial environment, it eliminates the need for large amounts of land, pesticides and other chemicals. Kimbal's aim is to create a sustainable and efficient urban farming system within cities and other densely populated areas that can reduce the need for transportation of food, while also providing more control over the quality of produce. Kimbal's company, Square Roots, is currently working on developing a vertical farming system that is capable of producing up to 10 times more produce than traditional farming methods, while using 95% less water and having a 100x smaller environmental footprint.']",
328,How virtual reality is changing the live music experience,"['Virtual reality is changing the live music experience in some interesting and exciting ways. The most obvious of these is the way it is allowing fans to experience live music in a more immersive and interactive way. For example, fans can now be placed right in the middle of the stage and dance along with their favorite musicians, creating a more participatory and engaging experience. Additionally, fans can use virtual reality to explore different aspects of the music, such as the stage set design and sound mix, allowing them to gain a better understanding of how the music is created. Finally, virtual reality can also be used by musicians to explore new and exciting ways of performing live, creating an ever-evolving and engaging experience for their fans.  As virtual reality (VR) technology advances, it is becoming increasingly used to transform the traditional music experience for fans everywhere. With VR, live music shows can be experienced from anywhere with a VR headset, allowing fans to feel as though they are really at the show. By using headsets, the audience can be transported to a simulated environment and experience the show from the perspective of the front row.  VR also allows shows to be broadcasted to a larger audience, regardless of their physical location. By allowing fans to watch a live performance from the comfort of their own home, VR broadens the access to music events and allows more people to enjoy the experience. As well, VR also offers new ways to experience live music in more interactive ways. Fans can be involved in the show in more tangible ways, such as having the chance to be part of the performance, influencing the outcome of the show, or immersing themselves in the band’s world.   Overall, the use of VR in the live music industry allows fans to experience shows in new and exciting ways. Not only can they watch a performance from the comfort of their own home, but they can also be involved with the performance in a more interactive way.

329,A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,"['McDonald’s used cooking oil can be converted into 3D printer filament and used for 3D printing. This can be done by filtration and degumming the oil, mixing it with a polymer, and then extruding it into a filament for 3D printing. This can be a great way to reuse McDonald’s used cooking oil, as well as being an environmentally friendly process.  McDonald's is currently experimenting with ways to turn its used cooking oil into biodiesel and other biofuel products. However, there are also ways to use it for 3D printing. Used cooking oil can be processed into a bioplastic known as polylactic acid (PLA), which can be melted and molded into nearly any shape and used for 3D printing. This PLA bioplastic is stronger and more durable than many other materials used for 3D printing and it also is much better for the environment. Additionally, it is cost-effective and can be used to create custom, one-of-a-kind items.  McDonald's used cooking oil can be repurposed in a variety of ways, including being used as fuel in biodiesel engines or being used as a base for soaps, candles, and lotions. However, it can also be used in 3D printing. 3D printing is a process by which a machine draws plastic or other type of material into a three dimensional object. Used cooking oil can be used as a base for the plastic material, producing a fully functional 3D printed item.  The fast food chain McDonald’s recently announced their plan to begin recycling used cooking oil in order to be more environmentally conscious. In addition to being recycled into biofuel, McDonald’s used cooking oil can also be used to create 3D printing filament. This filament can be used to create a wide range of objects from toys to tools and even small mechanical parts. 3D printing with McDonald’s used cooking oil is also an eco-friendly way to create these products, since it reduces plastic waste and does not require any hazardous chemicals.']",

Understand what it's like to live in a world of crime and violence and experience the events that shaped some of the most famous gangsters in history.  Al Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1899 and quickly rose to become the most powerful gangster in America. He gained notoriety for his involvement in bootlegging during the Prohibition era, bribery, murder, and the establishment of gambling and prostitution rackets.  Capone's criminal career began with the Five Points Gang, and he eventually formed his own criminal organization known as the Chicago Outfit. Capone's reign was characterized by a violent and ruthless approach to business and he used brutal techniques to maintain control of Chicago's criminal underworld. He was adept at using bribery and intimidation to keep people in line and maintained a network of corrupt politicians and law enforcement officers.  Capone's criminal activities eventually led to his conviction for income tax evasion in 1931. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison, of which he served only a few before his release due to ill health. After his release from prison, Capone still operated his racketeering business from his home in Florida until his death from a stroke in 1947.  Al Capone's criminal legacy continues to fascinate people to this day. His influence can be seen in modern crime fiction, television shows, and movies, and he is remembered as one of the most notorious gangsters in American history. John Gotti and do your best to stay one step ahead.  John Gotti was an infamous mobster who spent most of his life as the head of the Gambino crime family. He ran a vast empire of illegal activities, ranging from extortion and loan sharking to drug dealing and murder. He was also known for his ostentatious lifestyle, spending lavishly on luxury cars, clothing, and jewelry. He was eventually arrested and convicted of racketeering and murder in 1992, and he died while in prison in 2002.  As the head of one of the most powerful and dangerous criminal organizations in the world, staying one step ahead was essential to maintaining control of his empire. He employed strategies such as bribery and intimidation to ensure his associates’ loyalty. He also cultivated relationships with powerful political figures, including the mayor of New York City, to protect his interests.  Gotti was adept at manipulating the media and public opinion to his advantage. He was known for giving extensive interviews to outlets such as the New York Times and Newsweek, in which he presented himself as a generous and honest businessman. In public, his stylish dress and aristocratic bearing further enhanced his reputation as a successful leader. With his adept manipulation of the public and media, Gotti was able to avoid scrutiny and remain one step ahead of the authorities.  Gotti was also a master of staying one step ahead of his enemies. He employed a network of spies and informants to keep tabs on rival mobsters, and he used his influence to ensure that his associates remained loyal to him. He was also a master manipulator, capable of turning potential enemies into allies and exploiting their weaknesses.  Despite his ability to stay one step ahead, Gotti’s reign eventually came to an end. In 1992, he was arrested and convicted of multiple counts of racketeering and murder. He died in prison in 2002, but his legacy continues to live on through pop culture and countless books and films.']",
345,Why Britain's hated Pacer trains just won't go away,"['Britain's Pacer trains, a type of diesel-powered train introduced in the 1980s, have become something of a symbol of how the country's rail system has fallen behind other parts of Europe. The trains have become increasingly unpopular with passengers due to their age and lack of modern amenities, with some dubbing them ""Pacer-horses"" or ""plain-loiners"".  Despite their unpopularity, the Pacer trains appear to be here to stay. Although the government announced in 2018 that all Pacers would be retired by 2020, it later postponed its plans due to the difficulty of finding alternative rolling stock for the same routes. With the government's focus on sustaining regional rail services in the wake of Covid-19, it is likely that Pacers will continue to be used for the foreseeable future.  This is a source of frustration for many rail passengers, who feel that the government should invest in more modern and reliable trains. The Pacers are prone to breakdowns and are often overcrowded, leading to uncomfortable journeys. Additionally, the trains lack heated carriages, WiFi or other basic amenities, such as power sockets. With parts for the Pacer trains increasingly hard to find, the cost of keeping the trains running has become increasingly prohibitive for rail operators. This has led to some trains being withdrawn from service earlier than expected.  Despite the issues, Pacer trains remain a crucial link between towns and cities across the country and provide much-needed access to remote areas. As such, it is likely that the Pacer trains will remain in use for the foreseeable future, much to the disappointment of disgruntled passengers.']",

In many cases, these groups have sought to prevent the provision of aid and the welcoming of migrants and refugees, and have used fear, threats, and violence to try to achieve their objectives.  In response to this growing problem, many governments, aid organizations, and civil society groups have sought to find ways to counter the rise of vigilantism. These efforts have included responding to vigilante threats with clear and decisive statements condemning the use of violence and intimidation and reinforcing the right of all individuals to access support and protection. They have also included mobilizing local communities to counter the message of hostility being spread by vigilantes and reinforcing the message of welcoming and tolerance.  In addition, some governments have also sought to implement measures to address the underlying factors which can lead to vigilantism, such as restrictive policies and practices related to access to basic rights, fear of outsiders, and economic inequality. In this way, governments can work to prevent the rise of vigilante groups by addressing the grievances that can give rise to their formation.  Ultimately, it will take a collective effort from governments, civil society, and communities to ensure that migrants and refugees can access support safely and without fear of reprisal. This will require both the protection of those who work to provide welcome and assistance and the provision of protections and support to those who are seeking refuge.']",
361,Putin backs amendment that could see him run Russia until 2036,"['Russian President Vladimir Putin has backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036.  The amendment, which is due to be voted on by the public in a referendum this summer, would make changes to the constitution that could pave the way for Putin to remain in office beyond 2024, when his current term ends.  It would reset the clock on Putin's presidential terms, meaning his current four-term limit would no longer apply. This would make it possible for him to run for president two more times, potentially allowing him to remain in power until 2036.  The 65-year-old Putin has dominated Russia since 2000, when he first came to power. He is currently the longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin, who held power from 1924 until 1953.  The proposed amendment has been met with criticism both in Russia and internationally, with some observers arguing that it would amount to a power grab and undermine democracy. However, polls show that the majority of Russians support the amendment, illustrating that Putin still enjoys a high level of popularity.  Ultimately, the decision on the amendment will be made by the Russian people, who are expected to vote in the referendum in the coming months.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has backed a constitutional amendment that could potentially see him stay in power until 2036. The amendment, which is set to be voted on during a nationwide ballot in April, would reset the amount of time Putin has already served as president to zero. This means if Putin were to win the two consecutive six-year terms the amendment would allow for he could remain president until 2036. Putin has not directly said he plans to remain in power that long, but the move has sparked widespread criticism in Russia. Opponents argue that the move is a power grab that could undermine democracy and the rule of law in the country.']",

The couple spent the day at an event organized by the Commonwealth charity, the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, supporting a variety of organizations that work to empower young people.  The event marked the couples' final public engagement as senior royals before their transition away from the monarchy. In a video posted to Instagram, the pair stated that they will continue to be dedicated to service and “will always have the Queen’s support”.  The events of the day served as a reminder of the work that the couple has done over the last two years, from their visits around the UK and abroad, to supporting charities and causes such as mental health, women’s rights, and the environment.  The couple concluded the day with a visit to Canada House, where they made a speech praising the hospitality of Canada and their appreciation for having been able to spend time in the country. Harry also noted the importance of the Commonwealth in the couple's life, stating that the friendships and values in the Commonwealth will continue to be a priority for the couple.  The day's events are a fitting end to the couple's time as senior royals, and their commitment to service will continue after their transition.  Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have carried out their final official engagement as senior members of the British royal family.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had announced their intention to step down as senior royals in January and agreed with the royal family to no longer act as representatives of the Queen.  At Monday’s event, Harry and Meghan were seated apart from other royals, including the Queen and their first cousins Prince William and Prince Harry.   The couple were warmly welcomed as they arrived. An aide of the Queen had a long chat with the couple who received a standing ovation when they entered the abbey.

In addition, a number of stores have been closed, including bars and restaurants, which can only serve take-away food. The Italian government has also announced additional measures to help prevent the spread of the virus, including the gradual closure of its borders.

364,"Self-isolate or get paid? That's the choice for gig workers in a virus outbreak, and it's a big problem for the rest of us","['It is a difficult decision for gig workers in a virus outbreak, as they have to choose between keeping themselves and their families safe by self-isolating or taking the risk to work and get paid. This creates a big problem for the rest of us, as gig workers are vital in providing essential services. Without them, many businesses and services will suffer and society's functioning could be affected.   To solve this problem, governments and businesses should come together to support gig workers during a virus outbreak. Governments should provide financial assistance in the form of unemployment benefits and grants, while businesses can offer flexible work policies such as providing sick pay or allowing workers to telecommute. Additionally, businesses should offer clear and up-to-date information about how to effectively protect themselves while continuing to work. Finally, gig workers should be aware of their rights and understand the importance of self-isolation, so they can prioritize their health and safety while also continuing to make a living.  Self-isolating and getting paid are both difficult choices in a virus outbreak. For some gig workers, the two are incompatible-- because of their income and the risk of lost wages, they may find it hard to justify the need for self-isolation. However, this decision has consequences not only for their own health and safety, but for the health and safety of everyone else.  The decision to self-isolate or not in a virus outbreak has massive implications for public health. When an individual with COVID-19 continues to work and be active in the community, they can spread the virus to others. This can lead to large outbreaks, resulting in more hospitalizations, decreased access to health care, and an even greater economic impact.  For those who cannot afford to stay home and get paid, employers and the government need to take action. This can include providing access to paid sick leave, offering hazard pay to those who are unable to work due to the virus, and guaranteeing access to basic necessities.  Additionally, employers, the government, and consumers should also work together to create systems that enable workers to self-isolate without facing economic hardship. This could include emergency incentive and relief funds to cover essential expenses, such as food and bills, for workers who choose to stay home.  Ultimately, we need to ensure that all workers have the resources and support they need to make the difficult decision to self-isolate, and to do so without suffering significant economic losses. It’s the only way to protect our public health and help slow the spread of the virus.']",

The Duchess also highlighted the importance of making sure that women’s voices are heard, saying that “you are the ones who will set the tone for the kind of world we will live in.”   She urged the students to take action, saying “the time is now to become the change you want to see.”   Meghan concluded her remarks by reminding the students to “make your voice heard, use it to ask questions, to challenge the status quo, and to demand better.”  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, recently encouraged a group of students from the London College of Communication during a Royal visit to speak up for women’s rights. She advised the students to use their voices to create the change they wish to see in the world. She also encouraged the female students to use their voices to fight for the rights of women around the world and to push for equality. She said “I would encourage you all to use your voices - each and every one of you - to be a force for change in the world. Whether that’s through making people more aware, speaking up in a classroom, or on social media, or in the streets.”  The Duchess' wake-up call came at a time when women’s rights are increasingly under threat around the world, and is an especially timely reminder at a moment when we are celebrating International Women's Day.']",

The coronavirus pandemic has caused a surge in demand for the items typically associated with preppers, those who prepare for large-scale emergencies by stocking up on food and supplies. Businesses that sell survival items, such as freeze-dried food, water storage tanks, and medical supplies have reported increases in sales of up to 500%. Preppers have long been subject to ridicule and suspicion, but the current pandemic has given their industry a much-needed boost. With many facing job losses and uncertain economic times, prepping has now become a viable way for some to survive in the event of a long-term crisis..  As the coronavirus pandemic has spread throughout the world, the “prepper” movement has experienced a sudden surge in popularity. Preppers are people who prepare themselves for disasters of all kinds by stocking up on food, water, and other supplies to help them survive for an extended period of time. This has meant a booming business for preppers who specialize in selling survival supplies, as people rush to purchase essential items to help them in case of an emergency. Furthermore, preppers have benefited from the shift in public opinion surrounding their lifestyle.

Preppers have seen a big jump in sales of their preparedness products, from emergency food and water storage to medical supplies to weapons and ammunition. Moreover, the practice of prepping is spreading to more people in the general population who may not have considered it before. The pandemic appears to have motivated people to become more self-reliant and invest in their own safety.']",

The airline will likely reduce flight frequencies, reduce seat capacity on certain routes, and potentially eliminate routes altogether. In some cases, customers may be rebooked onto other airlines. Passengers may also experience increased waiting times and increased competition for seats as fewer flights become available. All Delta Air Lines customers should take into consideration the new scheduling, route modifications, and capacity reductions when making future travel plans.:  Delta Air Lines is reducing its overall capacity by 40% to match the reduced demand from customers due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction in capacity means fewer available seats and flights, fewer flights to airports outside the United States, and fewer routes flown. Delta is reducing its domestic capacity to allow more room for customers to spread out on flights, and will also reduce its international capacity. Delta will also be reducing the number of flights and aircraft operated, as well as parking aircraft that are no longer needed. Finally, Delta will be offering special fares to certain destinations in order to match the reduced demand.']",

379,Trump's ex-top economic adviser: US is in a recession,"['The US is facing an economic crisis in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and former top economic adviser under the Trump administration, Larry Kudlow, recently said that he believes the US is already in a recession. While a recession is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, Kudlow believes that a downturn has already begun as businesses have closed and unemployment has skyrocketed. He noted that the impact of the pandemic is likely to be worse than the 2008 financial crisis and that the recovery period could take longer. The government is expected to take further steps to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic and to help the US economy return to a path of growth.  President Donald Trump's former top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, acknowledged that the US is in a recession on Tuesday, the first time a senior White House official has acknowledged the economic downturn.  Kudlow, who served as Trump's director of the National Economic Council until March, told CNBC's “Squawk Box” that he believes the economic contraction began in the second quarter of this year.  “We are in a recession,” Kudlow said. “I think it began around April. That’s my own judgment.”  The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of when a recession starts and ends, has not yet declared it. Kudlow acknowledged that his pronouncement is not the official consensus but said he believes the official declaration is coming soon.  Kudlow also said that the US could still come out of the recession before the end of 2020 if progress against the coronavirus pandemic accelerates and businesses and consumers remain confident that the economy is recovering.']",

382,Megan Rapinoe slams US Soccer for 'blatant sexism',"['Megan Rapinoe has slammed US Soccer for its “blatant sexism” in the wake of the US Women’s National Team’s (USWNT) recent victory in the FIFA Women’s World Cup. Specifically, Rapinoe has criticized US Soccer for its pay inequalities and for its failure to provide the same level of support for the USWNT that it does for the US Men’s National Team.  In an open letter published by the Guardian, Rapinoe wrote “The clear disparity between the USWNT and USMNT programs is shameful and unwarranted,” and called on US Soccer to “immediately correct this gross disparity and inequality.”  Rapinoe's letter comes after a report showed that the USWNT earned $90 million less in bonuses than the USMNT despite the USWNT's success in the World Cup and the USMNT's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.   The USWNT has filed a lawsuit against US Soccer seeking back pay and damages for the gender discrimination they allege the federation has committed.

388,Lawyer defending Trump policy makes stunning admission,"['A lawyer representing the Trump administration in an ongoing legal challenge to the president's travel ban policy recently made a stunning admission that has caused consternation among legal observers. The lawyer argued in federal court that the president's ban, which largely restricts travel from certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa, is based partly on national security concerns and therefore is not subject to the standard judicial review process. This argument was met with shock and disbelief by the panel of judges, who noted that the administration has yet to provide any evidence suggesting the ban’s necessity or its effectiveness in achieving the purported security goals. Legal scholars believe that the administration’s argument has weakened the legal challenge to the travel ban.  The lawyer defending President Trump's plan to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) made an surprising statement in court this week. In the oral arguments before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department lawyer admitted that the Trump Administration could have done more to resolve the legal status of those currently protected by DACA. The admission seemingly undermines the Administration's argument that it sought to rescind the policy because it was legally dubious. The admission is likely to be a key point in the Supreme Court's eventual ruling in the case.  No lawyer has made any admissions regarding President Donald Trump's policies.  A lawyer defending President Donald Trump's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program made a stunning admission during oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.  The lawyer, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, admitted that if the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration, President Trump could unilaterally reinstated the program.  Francisco made the admission when Chief Justice John Roberts asked for a “limiting principle” if the Supreme Court ruled against the administration. Roberts asked Francisco whether Trump could re-instate DACA or a similar program if the Supreme Court struck down his decision to end the program, which provides protection from deportation to roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.  “Yes, of course,” Francisco answered.  The admission surprised many observers and came as a major concession in the case. DACA recipients are hopeful that the Supreme Court will find in their favor, but if not, Francisco’s admission could provide them with a potential path to relief.']",

Weinstein, 67, was found guilty earlier this month of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on a production assistant in 2006, and rape in the third degree for an attack on a woman in 2013.   Judge James Burke handed down the sentence in the Supreme Court of New York on Wednesday, saying Weinstein had shown ""a complete absence of remorse"".   Weinstein had faced a maximum sentence of 29 years but the judge said he needed to account for Weinstein's age and health issues. Weinstein was taken into custody immediately after the sentence was passed.   Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and is expected to appeal his conviction.  Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood mogul, has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault.   The sentence, handed down Wednesday in a New York City courtroom, marked the culmination of a dramatic, years-long saga that exposed the extent of sexual misconduct and the wide swath of power wielded by the once-untouchable Weinstein.   In February, Weinstein was found guilty by a jury of one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. He was acquitted of three other counts, including predatory sexual assault.   The sentence, handed down by Judge James M. Burke, was far harsher than the five-year minimum sentence Weinstein’s lawyers had requested. The judge also warned Weinstein, 67, that if he failed to remain within the parameters of his sentence, he would be sent to prison for life.   Weinstein appeared stoic as the sentence was read, though it was reported by multiple media outlets that he later broke down into tears. He had pleaded not guilty to all of the counts and maintained his innocence throughout the trial.   Weinstein’s sentencing marks a major milestone in the #MeToo movement, which began in 2017 when dozens of women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein.   The Weinstein scandal, and the courage of the many women who came forward, has been credited with inspiring a seismic shift in how society views sexual misconduct and how such allegations are reported and handled.']",

Greek forces have clashed with Turkish forces on multiple occasions, with tear gas and rubber bullets being fired and live rounds being fired from both sides. Greek soldiers have even resorted to using water cannons to disperse the refugees. The situation has created an atmosphere of fear, with both Greek and Turkish citizens reportedly fleeing to nearby safe havens.

Throughout its 2000-year history, the papacy has been a major force in world politics, diplomacy, culture, and theology. Popes have been instrumental in many of the most important decisions, from the political and religious unification of Europe to the standardization of the Catholic church's liturgy. Popes have also been instrumental in the development of the Catholic Church's doctrines and dogmas, leading to both reform and division.  The authority of the Pope is immense, and his power extends beyond the boundaries of the Catholic Church. Popes have long been seen as diplomatic intermediaries, mediators, and peacemakers in international conflicts and tensions, as well as advocates for justice and human rights, especially in times of war and political upheaval.  The authority of the Pope is also seen in his ability to appoint bishops and cardinals, declare papal Bulls (decrees concerning matters of the Church), and laicize clergymen. The Papacy is responsible for canon law, and the Pope is often sought out for matters of moral, ethical, and theological guidance. Popes have also been responsible for creating saints and beatifying people, as well as naming new groups and organizations to serve the Church.  The influence of the Pope is so great that he is often referred to as the ""Vicar of Christ,"" meaning God's representative on earth. The Pope's power and influence on both the spiritual and secular level makes him one of the most powerful figures on earth.

395,Louboutin wins fight to trademark red soles,"['| Louboutin  Yes, Christian Louboutin has successfully won the right to trademark its iconic red soles. On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in favor of the French luxury shoe designer, stating that Louboutin's signature hue could be trademarked as a ""color alone"" in the EU's trademark register. This ruling marks the end of a decade-long legal battle, in which Louboutin argued that its red-soled shoes were immediately recognizable and, thus, worthy of copyright protection.  The court's decision also stated that the red soles must remain recognizable in a different context from the rest of the shoe and be an integral part of its overall shape. This could mean that copying the sole design of a Louboutin shoe would be considered an infringement of the trademark.   This ruling is a major victory for Louboutin, as it gives the company legal protection against lower-priced copies of its iconic shoes. It also sets a precedent for fashion designers around the world who are looking to protect their work from counterfeiting.  French fashion designer Christian Louboutin has won a long-running court battle to trademark his iconic red-lacquered sole shoes.  In a ruling by the European Court of Justice on Tuesday, the judges upheld Louboutin's trademark of a red lacquered outsole on high-heeled shoes.  In the landmark case filed eight years ago, the Dutch-based firm Van Haren argued that Louboutin's trademark was too broad and blocked other competitors from copying its design.  The court found that the trademark was valid and that its use extended only to apply to high-heeled shoes with a contrasting red sole. ""The Court concludes that the use of a red outsole in footwear does not create a uniform impression across the Union for that category of goods,"" the ruling said.  Louboutin had argued that the signature red sole was integral to his brand, and that the trademark should apply to all footwear. ""The decision by the European Court of Justice is a huge victory for the brand and for the protection of creativity,"" Louboutin's lawyer, Paul Forré, said in a statement.  The red-lacquered outsole has become a staple of Louboutin's designs, and the iconic design has been seen on the feet of celebrities such as Rihanna, Sarah Jessica Parker and Blake Lively. The designer's logo is printed on the sole of each shoe, and his signature red heels can cost thousands of dollars.

A drug’s effectiveness is how well it works to treat a given condition or symptoms. Determining drug effectiveness can be done in several ways, including clinical trials and observational studies.  Clinical trials are research studies in which a drug is tested in a group of people with a given ailment to determine its safety and effectiveness. Clinical trials can be randomized, which means that subjects are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment being tested or a placebo. During the trial, participants are monitored for changes in symptoms or other outcomes. The results of clinical trials can be used to determine the effectiveness of the drug being tested.  Observational studies are research studies in which a group of people are observed over a period of time and monitored for changes in their symptoms or other outcomes. These studies usually do not involve randomization and can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of a drug. For example, an observational study may compare the health outcomes of patients who take a certain drug to those who do not.  In addition to clinical trials and observational studies, research reviews can also be used to determine the effectiveness of a drug. Reviews involve summarizing the results of several studies, including both randomized and observational studies, to find the most reliable evidence of a drug’s effectiveness. Reviews can also provide a better understanding of the benefits and risks associated with a given treatment.  Ultimately, the effectiveness of any drug treatment should be evaluated on an individual basis. Patients should discuss the potential risks and benefits of a treatment with their doctor before starting a new drug.']",

The conflict pitted the supporters of the King Charles I, known as Royalists or Cavaliers, against the supporters of Parliament, known as Roundheads or Parliamentarians. The war was the result of a long-standing political and religious struggle between the two sides.  The conflict between the two sides grew increasingly bitter and eventually led to armed conflict. At the beginning of the conflict, Charles I had the advantage as he had more experienced troops, better weapons, and more money. However, this advantage did not last long as the Parliamentarians’ support grew and they were able to gain the upper hand.  The English Civil War lasted from 1642-1651 and saw victories and defeats for both sides. Despite Charles’s advantage at the beginning of the war, the Parliamentarians were eventually able to gain control of the country.

408,Contact tracing is key to America's coronavirus strategy. What happens if it stops working well?,"['If contact tracing stops working well, it could potentially lead to a spike in the number of new cases. Without contact tracing, it could be difficult to identify individuals who might have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, making it difficult to contain the spread of the virus. In addition, without contact tracing, it would be more difficult to ensure that those infected with COVID-19 are isolated and safely monitored until they are no longer contagious. Without contact tracing, it could be very difficult to safely re-open workplaces, schools and other public spaces.  If contact tracing stops working well, it could mean that fewer people are being notified when they have been exposed to the virus, leading to further spread. This could lead to more people becoming infected, and in some cases, require larger-scale lockdowns in order to contain the virus. Additionally, contact tracing has been used to identify chains of transmission and help governments allocate resources to areas with high infection rates. If the contact tracing system stops working well, it may be more difficult to respond to outbreaks quickly and effectively.  If contact tracing stops working well, it could significantly hamper America’s efforts to contain the coronavirus. It is one of the most effective strategies for identifying, isolating and containing the virus, and for preventing further spread. Without it, the virus could spread quickly and uncontrollably, leading to an even more severe health crisis and economic downturn. If contact tracing stops working well, the government must have a Plan B in place to prevent, control, and mitigate the spread of the virus. This could include more stringent quarantine measures, expanded testing, more targeted and localized restrictions, and increased investment in health care infrastructure.']",
409,New CDC guidance says older adults should 'stay at home as much as possible' due to coronavirus,"['CDC guidelines recommend that older adults stay at home as much as possible due to their higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. This includes limiting contact with people outside of their households, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, washing hands frequently, wearing a mask in public and maintaining 6 feet of distance from others. Older adults should also check their local community guidelines and practice social distancing when out in public.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an updated pandemic guidance for older adults, recommending they “stay at home as much as possible.” The new guidance is meant to protect those who are most vulnerable to the virus, but it does not mandate quarantine. Instead, the CDC recommends that older adults stay home as much as possible, avoid large crowds and gatherings, and practice social distancing when out in public. The CDC also encourages older adults to talk to their health care providers about their risk and what they can do to stay safe.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that adults over the age of 65 should ""stay at home as much as possible"" due to the coronavirus pandemic. In an updated guidance document published Friday, the CDC said older adults should minimize contact with both people outside their household as well as those who are considered “high risk” for severe illness from COVID-19, such as people with underlying medical conditions. The guidance also suggests that older adults should avoid crowds, travel, and exercise outdoors only if social distancing protocols can be followed. Additionally, the CDC recommends that older adults should wear a face covering when leaving the house.']",
410,Former CDC director: It's time to restrict visits to nursing homes,"['I agree that it is time to restrict visits to nursing homes to protect their vulnerable populations. Visitation policies should be developed in collaboration with healthcare professionals, families, and local public health officials to ensure the safety of residents. This will require the implementation of practices such as: limiting visitors to those necessary for medical care, health, and well-being; requiring visitors to use personal protective equipment such as face masks or face shields; monitoring visitors for signs of illness; and screening visitors for risk factors such as recent travel history. Such policies should be regularly reviewed and revised as needed.  The health and safety of residents of nursing homes is of the utmost importance. It is critical that steps are taken to limit the risk of infection in these vulnerable populations. In order to do this, it is prudent to restrict visitors to nursing homes, except in exceptional circumstances. This includes family members, staff, and healthcare professionals. Visitors should be subject to health screenings and travel restrictions, and should wear masks, maintain social distancing, and follow hand-washing protocols. It is important for nursing homes to review their policies for visitors on a regular basis, to ensure that any changes reflect the most up-to-date recommendations from public health authorities.  Visiting nursing homes can be an integral part of providing care and comfort for residents, but the current COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented risks to those vulnerable populations. We must take steps to protect nursing home residents from the devastating effects of this virus.   Restricting visits to nursing homes is an important step to take in these unprecedented times. All visitors should be limited to essential medical personnel and close family members. Temperature screenings and other safety protocols should be in place for all who enter for the safety of both visitors and residents. Additionally, visitors should be asked questions about their potential exposure to the virus and their recent travel history to ensure that no one brings the virus into the facility.  Finally, we should consider utilizing virtual visitations and other technology to allow nursing home residents to communicate with their loved ones. Utilizing these measures can help protect the health and safety of nursing home residents while still allowing them to connect with those that they love.']",
411,America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing down,"['As coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket across the United States, public health experts are warning that the nation is entering a “new normal,” with rising infection rates, hospitalizations, and deaths due to the virus.   In recent weeks, many states have set new records for the number of new COVID-19 cases identified in a 24-hour period. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. reported more than 240,000 cases on July 6, a single-day record, with no definitive signs of cases slowing down.   Experts are warning that this “new normal” of higher infection rates will most likely persist for several months, if not longer. This means that it is increasingly important for individuals to adhere to the latest public health recommendations, including wearing a mask, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.   In an effort to contain the virus, many states have implemented widespread testing programs, which have become increasingly important in helping to identify and isolate infected individuals. Additionally, contact tracing is being used to identify and warn people who have come in contact with an infected person.

Waist size has been correlated to have a direct relationship with obesity, which has been linked to increased risk of heart attack. A large waist size is typically associated with being overweight or obese, which puts extra strain on the heart, making it more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases. People with larger waist circumferences are also more likely to suffer from metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of heart attack. Therefore, waist size may be more important than weight when it comes to predicting the risk of a heart attack. factors. Waist size is directly associated with factors like central obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, which are all risk factors for heart attacks.

422,"Exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity, researchers say","['. This advice could include recommendations such as increasing fruit and vegetable intake, reducing the amount of processed and sugary food, eating more plant-based proteins, cutting back on added sugar and salt, and being mindful of portion sizes. The advice could also provide tips on how to prepare healthier meals with healthier ingredients. Additionally, the labels could provide information about the number of calories in a serving and the amount of physical activity required to burn off those calories. This information could be used to help people make more informed food choices, which could potentially lead to healthier eating habits and better weight outcomes.  Yes, exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity, according to researchers. In a 2016 study conducted by the University of Michigan, researchers found that providing nutrition labels on foods offerings at schools that featured exercise advice had a positive impact on the BMI of seventh-grade students. They reported that providing exercise advice on food labels was associated with an average decrease in BMI of 0.9 units, which was indicative of reduced obesity. This result was attained by having students walk more during lunch and snack times, with the advice being written on the food labels. The researchers suggested that introducing labels featuring exercise advice as a form of public health intervention could be an effective way to reduce obesity among children. The study's authors also suggested that other food labeling formats, such as graphic warnings, could also be beneficial in reducing obesity.  Exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity, researchers have suggested. A new study found that including advice about physical activity on the labels of food and drink packaging could be an effective way to encourage people to consume fewer calories.  The researchers looked at the labels of 4,300 products from five major supermarkets in the UK and found that only 1.5 percent of these included advice about exercise. Such advice often included statements such as 'Be active for 30 minutes every day' or 'Take the stairs instead of the lift'.  The study suggests that including this type of advice on labels could help to increase awareness of the need to exercise, and could make people think twice before over-consuming food or beverages with high levels of fat, salt and sugar.  The researchers also noted that including exercise advice on labels could be a cost-effective way to address the global problem of rising levels of obesity.  Though more research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of using exercise advice on food labels, the findings hint at a potential way to help tackle the obesity epidemic.']",

It has been found that Lompoc residents live, on average, three years longer than those living in nearby cities. This extended life expectancy is thought to be largely due to the small town's healthy lifestyle and sense of community.  The studies suggest that living in a supportive, religious community is beneficial for physical and mental health. Lompoc’s population is highly religious and values being part of a spiritual, tight-knit community. The town also encourages its residents to take part in physical activities such as walking, jogging and biking, as well as engaging in healthier forms of recreation. Additionally, the town has numerous parks and hiking trails where people can get outdoors and enjoy nature.  The findings of these studies suggest that living a healthier lifestyle in a supportive religious community can contribute to living longer. Participating in physical activities, engaging with the community, and being part of a spiritual and supportive town could help to extend a person’s life expectancy. Furthermore, the sense of community, respect, and faith that Lompoc encourages can be beneficial for mental health and general wellbeing.  Living in a sunny, religious town in California may be beneficial for longevity. The town’s sunny climate is likely to provide residents with more exposure to Vitamin D, which can help boost immunity and protect against certain diseases that can reduce life expectancy. Research has also suggested that practicing a religion can have profound effects on mental or physical health. Participating in an organized religion can provide people with a sense of purpose, provide social support, and even help to reduce stress.

424,Does having boys or girls run in families? New study says it's down to chance,"['While there are some studies that suggest that having a boy or girl run in families may be a result of genetic factors, a recent study suggests that the majority of gender determination is down to chance. Researchers analyzed data from over 400,000 births and compared multiple factors, including maternal and paternal age, as well as gender of the previous children in a family.  The results found that the probability of having a boy or girl within a family didn’t differ significantly from the natural 50/50 gender ratio of boys versus girls at birth.  The lead researcher concluded that probability of having a boy or girl isn’t linked to any particular family trait, but is instead down to luck.  It appears that whether a family has boys or girls is largely down to chance, according to a recent study published in the journal Human Reproduction. Researchers studied more than 40,000 mothers and about 1.5 million live births in China between 1982 and 2015 and found that the sex ratio of children born to the same woman was no different than the random chance of having either a boy or a girl. The study also found that the sex ratio of siblings within the same family was statistically insignificant. Therefore, it appears that having boys or girls is not a trait that runs in families, and is ultimately determined by chance.  According to a new study published in the journal Human Reproduction, having boys or girls in a family may come down to chance. The study, which included over 12,500 families in the Netherlands, found that family structure did not influence the gender ratio of a family's children. The researchers found that boys and girls were conceived in a ratio of about 1:1, which did not vary based on the gender of the previous children in the family. This suggests that gender is not determined by family structure, but rather random chance.']",

The study focused on the role of sleep timing and consistency and how they may be linked to a child's body mass index (BMI). The study found that children who had bedtimes after 8:30pm were 61% more likely to become overweight or obese compared to those with a bedtime before 8pm. The study concluded that encouraging regular bedtime and wake up times may be helpful in reducing the risk of childhood obesity.  A recent study has linked a later bedtime with higher rates of obesity in children under the age of 6. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Minnesota, examined the bedtime habits of over 10,000 children and their body mass index (BMI). The results showed that children who had a bedtime of 9 pm or later were more likely to be obese compared to those who went to bed earlier. The researchers believe that a later bedtime could lead to children being exposed to more unhealthy eating, such as snacking at night, or being awake for longer periods in which they are more likely to watch television or engage in other sedentary activities. The researchers suggest that parents should start instilling healthy sleep habits in their children early, to help prevent obesity.  A recent study has linked a later bedtime among children under the age of 6 to an increased risk of obesity. The study, published in Pediatrics, tracked bedtimes and body weight measurements of 977 young children over three years. It found that children who had a bedtime of 9 pm or later were significantly more likely to be obese compared to children who had an earlier bedtime of 7 pm or 8 pm.  The researchers also found that children with a later bedtime were more likely to engage in fewer activities, such as outdoor play, that are associated with better physical health. The study suggests that making sure children get enough sleep, especially those under 6 years of age, could be an important factor for helping to reduce obesity. The authors note that more research is needed to understand the full impact of bedtime on obesity and other health outcomes.']",

427,"Social media use may harm teens' mental health by disrupting positive activities, study says","['A new study has found that the use of social media by young people may adversely affect their mental health. The study, which was published in the journal Psychological Science, looked at how social media use affects mental health when it disrupts activities that are more conducive to well-being, such as exercise, face-to-face social interactions, and sleep. Overall, the researchers found that when adolescents replace these positive activities with social media use, it can lead to an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety. The study suggests that limiting the amount of time young people spend on social media could help reduce the risk of mental health issues.   According to a recent study, teenagers' use of social media can lead to negative mental health outcomes. The study found that teenagers who used social media more often were more likely to be less happy, more anxious, and more likely to engage in negative activities such as smoking and drinking. The study also suggested that this negative impact was linked to the amount of time spent on social media and not the type of social media being used. The researchers also found that spending more time on positive activities such as talking with family and friends, reading, and engaging in physical activities was associated with better mental health outcomes.  A new study has suggested that social media use may be linked to mental health problems among teenagers. The research, which was recently published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, found that teenagers who spent two or more hours on social media per day were more likely to report feeling unhappy, anxious, or having low self-esteem, compared to those who spent less time on the platforms. The study also found that teens who used social media more than two hours a day were less likely to participate in more positive activities such as spending time with friends, reading, or outdoor activities. The authors suggest that this could be due to a decrease in time spent on other activities and less family time. They recommend that parents and health professionals should be aware of this link and work towards designing and implementing interventions to reduce the potentially harmful effects of social media use for teens.']",

Parents should also keep a close eye on their children’s activities, including who they spend time with and what they’re doing at any given time. When possible, parents should also research the contents of any vaping products their children may be using, as some may contain nicotine or other harmful ingredients. Finally, parents should consider setting reasonable rules for their children, such as no vaping in the home or no use of certain types of vaping products, such as those containing nicotine.  1.

429,Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness?,"['No, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a germ-free childhood could trigger leukemia. Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that has many possible causes, but the exact cause is not known. While it is true that children living in an overly clean environment may be more likely to develop allergies and asthma, there is no evidence to suggest that a germ-free childhood causes leukemia.  It is not known if germ-free childhoods could trigger illnesses such as leukemia. Studies have found that having a lack of exposure to germs, particularly during the early years of life, may reduce the risk of allergies, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses. However, research has not shown a connection between a germ-free childhood and leukemia.   Leukemia is most commonly caused by genetic mutations and is believed to be triggered by environmental factors that interact with those mutations. A number of environmental factors have been found to increase the risk of developing leukemia, including exposure to certain chemicals, radiation, and viruses.   While the science does not suggest that germ-free childhoods could trigger leukemia, it is important to remember that good hygiene practices are important to prevent infections and illnesses.  It is not clear if a germ-free childhood necessarily triggers illnesses, such as leukemia. However, there is some evidence that suggests it could be a factor, as children who grow up in very clean environments may lack exposure to some of the naturally occurring 'good' bacteria and viruses that their counterparts in more diverse environments are exposed to. This could lead to a weakened immune system, which could make children more susceptible to infections and illnesses.']",
430,Partial e-cigarette 'flavor ban' goes into effect today. Here's what happens next,"['Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is putting into effect a partial ban on flavored e-cigarettes. The ban applies to all cartridge-based flavored e-cigarette products, including menthol, fruit, and candy, as well as any other vaping flavors that appeal to youth.  The ban does not apply to open-tank systems and other vaping products that rely on e-liquid not sold in cartridges.   The ban is a response to the increasing popularity of flavored electronic cigarettes among teenagers. According to the FDA, more than 5 million minors are using e-cigarettes, leading to an increase in nicotine addiction, respiratory illness, and other health concerns.  To enforce the ban, the FDA will be conducting surprise inspections of vape shops and other retailers to ensure compliance. If a retailer is found to be selling prohibited products, the FDA can put them out of business.   Going forward, it will be up to the manufacturers of flavored e-cigarettes to submit applications to the FDA that demonstrate their products are appropriate for the protection of public health.   The hope is that this ban will reduce the number of minors using e-cigarettes and help protect them from serious health risks. In the meantime, adults who would like to continue using flavored e-cigarettes will have to stay updated on any changes to the regulations and shop carefully in order to make sure their purchases are not prohibited.  The partial e-cigarette flavor ban goes into effect today in the US, with flavored e-cigarette cartridges and pods being sold only in physical stores. This means that flavored e-cigarettes, such as fruit and menthol, will no longer be sold online.   The ban is intended to help curb the surge in teen vaping and prevent further cases of e-cigarette-related illnesses. It is also a response to the increasing pressure from the public and federal agencies to regulate the industry.   Going forward, stores will be required to have age-verification systems in place to ensure that only adults are buying flavored e-cigarette products. Stores must also have systems to ensure that customers are not buying the products in bulk.   The FDA is also requiring that the nicotine content of flavored pods and cartridges be reduced to 20mg/ml, which is lower than the nicotine levels in regular combustible cigarettes.   It remains to be seen how effective the partial ban will be in curbing e-cigarette related illnesses and preventing teens from accessing flavored e-cigarette products.  The long-term effects of the ban also remain unclear.  Public health advocates have argued that a more comprehensive ban on flavored e-cigarettes would be more effective in reducing their use.']",
431,US life expectancy climbs for first time in four years,"['After four consecutive years of declines, US life expectancy has finally climbed again. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the life expectancy of Americans rose to 78.7 years in 2018, up from 78.6 years in 2017.  Experts say that the rise in life expectancy is likely due in part to a decrease in drug overdose deaths, which declined by 4.1 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. This is the first decrease in overdose deaths since 1990. Additionally, the decrease in deaths from heart disease, cancer, and stroke may have contributed to the rise in life expectancy.  Overall, the CDC noted that mortality rates for the ten leading causes of death declined in 2018. However, the mortality rate for suicide and Alzheimer’s disease still rose. This indicates that there is still work to be done to ensure that Americans continue to see increases in life expectancy in the future.  According to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the life expectancy at birth in the United States in 2017 rose by a small but significant amount for the first time in four years. The report, which was released on Thursday, revealed that the life expectancy for Americans in 2017 was 78.6 years, up from 78.5 years in 2016.  This is the first time in four years that life expectancy has increased, as it had been declining since 2014. The report also found that the death rate decreased by 2.8 percent between 2016 and 2017, which was the most significant decrease since 2012. Additionally, the 10 leading causes of death in the United States remained the same between 2016 and 2017, although the age-adjusted death rate for each cause decreased except for unintentional injuries and Alzheimer’s disease.  The increase in life expectancy is good news for Americans, although the United States still lags behind other wealthy countries in terms of life expectancy. For example, the 2017 life expectancy in the United States is still lower than the life expectancy for the same year in countries like Canada and Australia, which are both over 81 years. Nevertheless, the small increase in life expectancy is a positive sign for the U.S. moving forward.']",

Trump did not provide any explanation for the unusual circumstances of his visit, leading to rumors and speculation about the president's health.']",
433,"Dr. Sanjay Gupta on medical marijuana: We are in an age of wisdom, but also an age of foolishness","['. Medical marijuana is a very complicated and controversial issue. On one hand, it has been used for millennia to treat a variety of health conditions including pain, insomnia, and various forms of cancer. On the other hand, it remains classified as an illegal Schedule I drug in the United States. As a doctor, it is important to weigh the potential risks and benefits of medical marijuana before recommending it to a patient. While current evidence suggests that medical marijuana can be used safely and effectively to treat certain conditions, more research is needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of its use.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta has consistently voiced his opinion in support of medical marijuana. He believes that cannabis has numerous proven medicinal benefits, and that it should be available as a treatment option for those who can benefit from it. In a recent article, he wrote, “We are in an age of wisdom, but also an age of foolishness. While we can no longer deny the medicinal potential of cannabis — and the harms of criminalization — our current laws around marijuana are still deeply misguided.” Dr. Gupta believes that medical marijuana should be regulated in the same way as many other medications, allowing for appropriate research, access, and education. He says, “Our leaders need to step up, acting with science instead of rhetoric and allowing for access to medical marijuana.” when it comes to medical marijuana. We have to be careful not to jump to conclusions about its efficacy and safety based on anecdotal evidence. On the other hand, we should acknowledge that it does have some potential when prescribed properly, especially for pain, appetite stimulation and other conditions for which there is no other viable treatment. We should recognize that many states have already passed laws allowing for medical marijuana, and that it is important for physicians and patients to discuss potential risks and benefits when considering its use.']",
434,"Sit, stand, sit: The new science about how to best use your standing desk","['The scientific evidence on the best way to use a standing desk is still ongoing. However, there are some general guidelines that can be used to maximize the benefits of a standing desk.   First, it is important to alternate between sitting and standing regularly throughout the day. Depending on individual preference, this could mean sitting and standing every 30 minutes, or alternatively, some studies suggest alternating between sitting and standing every 15-20 minutes.   In addition to regularly alternating between sitting and standing, it is also important to keep posture in mind. This means standing up straight and keeping feet shoulder width apart with weight distributed evenly between both feet.   Finally, it is important to keep in mind that one should not stand for too long at once. Experts suggest taking regular breaks from standing in order to rest and stretch out the lower back, hips, and legs. Taking breaks throughout the day for sitting and standing helps to ensure a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.  This article focuses on the body's response to different postures, specifically those adopted when using a standing desk. It looks at how standing transfers the weight of your body to different areas and how this affects your posture and concentration. The article also looks at the impact of different desk heights and how they can affect working comfort. It looks at the importance of proper posture and ergonomics, as well as providing advice on how to make the most of your standing desk.  The use of standing desks has been growing in popularity in recent years, and there is a lot of discussion about their benefits. While some research suggests that standing desks can help improve posture and reduce the risk of certain health problems, the science is still not conclusive. Recent studies suggest that it is best to use both sitting and standing positions throughout the day, rather than relying on a single desk setup. It is important to find a balance between sitting and standing, as prolonged sitting or standing can lead to health issues. Additionally, as people adjust to standing desk use, it is important to start slowly and allow the body to become accustomed to the different positions. Monitor your posture, comfort level, and any back, shoulder, or neck discomfort when using a standing desk and make modifications accordingly.']",
435,"Not all screen time causes kids to underperform in school, study says","['A recent study has found that not all screen time is inherently bad for children's academic performance. The study, conducted by the University of Oxford, set out to examine the links between screen time and academic outcomes.  The researchers used data from more than 11,000 children aged between 4 and 16, collected by the Millennium Cohort Study. They compared the amount of time the children spent watching or playing on screens per day against their performance in school exams.  The results showed that only the use of screens for gaming was linked to poorer academic performance. All other forms of screen use, from social media to movie-watching, had no significant negative impact.  The researchers suggest that this could be because these activities can offer educational opportunities, such as learning about cultures and lifestyles, or watching a documentary that sparks an interest in a particular topic.  Therefore, it appears that it is not all screen time that is damaging to children's academic performance, and that it may be beneficial in some cases.  A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics has found that not all screen time causes children to underperform in school. The study found that children who used computers, tablets, and mobile devices for educational purposes performed better on academics tests than those who did not. Researchers concluded that screen time was associated with improved academic performance, especially when used for educational activities. The study looked at children between the ages of 8 and 16 and found that those who used educational apps, software, or websites benefitted the most from their screen time. While the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship, it does suggest that there may be an optimal level of educational screen time that can benefit a student’s academic performance.']",

440,"What we aren't eating is killing us, global study finds","['A new global study has found that what people are not eating is killing them, with inadequate diets now responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other factor, including smoking.   The research, published in The Lancet, concluded that dietary risks, such as not eating enough whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds, and eating too much processed meat and sugary beverages, are responsible for 11 million deaths globally every year.   The study was based on analysis of global dietary habits and their link to deaths and health problems such as coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Of the 11 million deaths annually, more than half were caused by cardiovascular diseases.   The authors of the report also highlighted that access to healthier food options needs to be improved, particularly in countries where unhealthy diets are most prevalent. They emphasized the importance of creating global dietary guidelines that incorporate culturally relevant food and the promotion of the types of diets that can be sustainable, such as traditional diets.   This may include the Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to improved health outcomes, as well as diets which focus on whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts, and plant-based proteins.   Overall, the report emphasizes the need for international regulations and policies to reduce unhealthy diets, promote healthier lifestyles, and make healthy foods more accessible.  A new global study finds that dietary diversity and nutrition are essential for optimal health and that not eating the right foods is now one of the leading global drivers of death and disability. The study, led by the Global Burden of Disease group and published in Nature, reveals that unhealthy diets are now responsible for 22% of all deaths globally. This means that poor diet has surpassed smoking as the leading cause of death in many countries.  The study suggests that people should eat a more varied diet, with a focus on nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, wholegrain, nuts and healthy oils, as well as decreasing their consumption of processed foods and red meat.  The findings of this study have vast implications for public health, not only in terms of dietary guidelines, but also in terms of policies and programs that work to increase the availability and affordability of healthy foods, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Without significant changes, it is likely that poor diet will continue to be one of the leading global drivers of death and disability.']",

449,Flu shot: There's a mismatch this season -- and it's not good news for children,"['This year’s flu season is shaping up to be an unusual one. While older adults are being given the standard trivalent vaccine, the version of the flu vaccine given to children and teens is significantly different.  Instead of the standard trivalent vaccine, which protects against three strains of the flu, children and teens are being given a quadrivalent vaccine, which guards against four strains. This is the first time that this newer version of the vaccine has been available in the United States, though it has been used in Europe and Canada over the past few years.  The mismatch between the two vaccines could mean that some children and teens may not be as well protected against the flu as their older counterparts. That’s because the strains of the flu in the quadrivalent vaccine don’t necessarily match the ones in the trivalent vaccine.  Health experts advise that children and teens get the quadrivalent flu vaccine as soon as possible to ensure that they are as well protected as possible from the flu. It’s also important to note that the flu shot is not a guarantee that you won’t get the flu; however, it can significantly reduce the severity of symptoms if you do come down with the virus.  This year, the mismatch between the flu shot and the viruses circulating means that the vaccine may not be as effective as it has been in the past. The most commonly circulating virus is H3N2, which is one of the hardest viruses for the vaccine to protect against. As a result, this season’s flu shot may be less effective for children, who are especially vulnerable to the flu.  It’s still important to get a flu shot this season, even if it isn’t 100% effective. The vaccine can still help reduce the severity of the symptoms, and may even help protect against other circulating strains of the virus. Vaccination also goes a long way to helping protect those around you, since it reduces the spread of the virus in the community.']",

453,"On Friday the 13th we wonder why, scientifically, we believe in superstitions","['Superstitions have been around since ancient times and have been seen to transcend almost all human cultures. Scientifically speaking, superstitions are believed to exist because people have a tendency to look for patterns and connections in the world around them even when none exist. This is called apophenia, and it is viewed as an evolutionary adaptation that may have helped humans more easily recognize predators or resources in the environment. Additionally, superstitions may also offer a sense of control in situations where the outcome is uncertain and can provide a feeling of comfort..  Scientifically, superstitions are often times irrational beliefs that necessary link negative outcomes with certain activities, events, days, etc. There are a variety of explanations for why we are drawn to superstitions. One possible explanation is that, since superstitions are often tied to seemingly random occurrences, they offer us a sense of control in an unpredictable world. We may use superstitions to try to predict our luck or future outcomes, and to guard against negative outcomes. Additionally, superstitions may enable us to cope with fear and anxiety. They can provide people with a sense of comfort and security when faced with uncertain or threatening situations. Finally, our beliefs in superstitions may be encouraged by our family, friends, or media. We may see superstitions practiced around us or hear people talk about them, leading us to follow suit..  Scientifically speaking, superstitious beliefs may arise from the fact that humans are naturally inclined to look for patterns and draw conclusions. When something positive or negative happens, we may try to search for explanations in our environment, and when the answer can't be readily explained, it may cause us to create the idea of superstition. As events keep happening that can't be explained, we may become more likely to believe in superstitions, and the idea of them becomes ingrained in our minds. This could be an evolutionary adaptation that humans have developed to help them survive and respond to dangers—for example, if you believed that avoiding a certain path in the forest seemed to reduce the risk of you being eaten by a wild animal, then you would be more likely to take that path every time, thus increasing your chances of survival.']",

The study, which was published in morbidity and mortality weekly report, focused on the first known case of coronavirus in the US, which occurred in late January 2020. The study examined the medical records of the infected individual, who was a traveler from Wuhan, China, and a woman in her 30s who had close contact with the traveler.  The study found that the woman, who was a family member of the infected traveler, became ill two days after the traveler left the United States. She was admitted to the hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. The study concluded that her illness was likely caused by extended, unprotected contact with the infected traveler.  The study notes that the infected traveler had been informed by medical professionals to avoid contact with others and to wear a face mask when going out in public, but had not done so.  The study suggested that this case serves as a reminder for everyone to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus, including avoiding close contact with those who may be infected and wearing face masks in public.

How to tell the difference","['Allergies, the flu, and the coronavirus all have many similar symptoms, including fever, coughing, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. However, there are some distinct differences, including the onset of the symptoms. Allergy symptoms often start slowly and gradually worsen. Flu symptoms develop more rapidly, starting 1-4 days after you have been exposed, and the symptoms are usually worse than those of allergies. The coronavirus has a 2-14 day incubation period, so it may be difficult to distinguish it from the flu at first, however the coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms such as chest tightness and shortness of breath. If you think you may have any of these illnesses, it is important to contact your doctor to discuss your symptoms and get tested.  If you have symptoms of a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, it is important to consult your healthcare provider. All three conditions can have similar symptoms and the only way to be certain is to get tested. Your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms, travel history and contact with anyone who may have been infected.   If you have mild symptoms, your healthcare provider may recommend you self-isolate for 14 days and call for medical advice if symptoms worsen.  Medical diagnosis is best left to healthcare professionals. Here are some general guidelines to help you distinguish the three conditions:  Allergies: Allergies cause sneezing, coughing, itchy eyes, and a runny nose. These symptoms can often be treated with over-the-counter medications.  Flu: Flu symptoms can include fever, body aches and pains, chills, sore throat, and a cough. Treatment may include antiviral medications and rest.  Coronavirus: Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, and fatigue.

460,"Babies smell 'sweet,' teens stink and blindfolded moms can tell the difference, study says","['A new study has found that babies have a distinct “sweet” smell that is different from that of teens and adults, and that blindfolded mothers can identify their child just by smelling them. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, involved having a group of 42 mothers and their babies, as well as 40 teenagers, wear a clean cotton T-shirt for two days. Afterward, the mothers were blindfolded and asked to identify the smell of their own baby and the teenagers. The results showed that the mothers were able to accurately identify their baby with 86 percent accuracy. The study's authors concluded that the “distinctive odour of infants may provide important information for the mother-infant relationship, potentially facilitating maternal insights and attachment behaviours in the early days of life.”  A new study out of Norway has found that mothers are able to accurately distinguish between the scents of babies, teenagers and adults while blindfolded. Researchers at the University of Oslo surveyed 49 mothers from Norway and found that the majority of them were able to correctly identify the ages of the babies and teenagers based on their smells. The study concluded that babies smell ""sweet"" in comparison to teenagers and adults, and that the odors associated with teenagers have significantly more pungent aromas. The findings could help explain the often-noted fact that parents are more likely to be able to pick their own babies out of a room of infants.  Researchers at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland have found that blindfolded mothers can actually tell the difference between the scent of babies and teens, with babies being perceived as having a much sweeter smell than the scent of a teenager. The study, which was published in the journal PLOS One, involved having mothers and their children sniff various scents while blindfolded and then rate them. The results showed that the mothers were able to tell the difference between the aroma of babies and teenagers, with babies being rated as having a much sweeter smell than the teens. The researchers believe this could be due to the fact that babies produce different hormones than teenagers and as such, these hormones may give off a sweeter smell.']",

464,Lessons from Ebola: The secret of successful epidemic response,"['1. Early detection and containment: Timely and thorough detection and reporting of potential epidemics is essential for a successful response. Rapid response teams should be deployed to investigate any reports of potential cases, while health officials need to place strict containment measures around those that have been confirmed.  2. Establish clear and consistent communication: Clear communication is key to creating a coordinated response plan. Health officials should create accessible materials with information about the disease, its epidemiology, symptoms, and preventive measures. This should be disseminated widely to health care workers and the general public.  3. Strengthen public health infrastructure: A key lesson from Ebola is that strong public health systems are essential for any successful epidemic response. Health professionals should make sure that health systems have the necessary resources to monitor, diagnose, and treat affected individuals.  4. Invest in research and development: Research and development into new drugs, vaccines, and treatments must be a priority. This will help ensure better preparedness in the face of epidemics.  5. Improve international coordination: International cooperation and coordination is also essential for successful epidemic response. International organizations should work together to develop conditions that facilitate the sharing of information and resources, coordination of activities, and provide support to affected countries.  1. Early detection and rapid containment: Early detection of a potential outbreak and rapid containment of infected individuals to prevent further transmission is key to stopping an outbreak. This includes the prompt identification of suspected cases through improved surveillance systems, widespread contact tracing and monitoring, and the implementation of public health emergency measures.  2. Strengthen public health systems: Effective emergency response requires strong public health systems and capabilities that can rapidly identify and respond to a potential outbreak.

The WHO officially declared the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, after the virus had spread to over 100 countries and infected more than 118,000 people. The WHO's definition of a pandemic is ""the worldwide spread of a new disease."" As the novel coronavirus has spread around the world, CNN and other news outlets are using the term pandemic to describe it.  CNN is calling the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic because the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. According to the WHO, a pandemic occurs when a new virus emerges, is highly infectious and is spread around the world. The coronavirus has spread to more than 200 countries and infected more than 1.3 million people, meeting the criteria for a pandemic.  CNN is calling the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic because the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The WHO defines a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease. Since the novel coronavirus has spread to nearly every corner of the globe, it fits this definition and is thus considered a pandemic.

468,Syrians are in a desperate race to outrun a brutal regime offensive,"['that has driven tens of thousands of civilians from their homes since the start of the year. The fighting in Idlib and its surrounding countryside, the last remaining rebel-held bastion in Syria, has displaced nearly a million people so far. Many of those fleeing have nowhere to go, as most of the surrounding areas are already full.   Desperately seeking safety, Syrians are seeking refuge in camps and makeshift settlements throughout Idlib, but many are facing dire conditions. Hundreds of thousands lack access to adequate healthcare and nutrition, while far too many are living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. The harsh winter weather has added to the suffering, further straining the limited resources and capabilities of local NGOs.  The international community has yet to step in with any meaningful efforts to help the beleaguered people of Idlib. Last fall, the United Nations announced a plan for a ceasefire in the region, but it has not been fully implemented. In the meantime, countries such as Turkey, the United States, and European powers have largely stayed on the sidelines, even as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.  The world can and must do more to help the people of Idlib in their desperate race for safety. The international community must immediately pressure the Syrian regime to halt its offensive and find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In the meantime, countries must contribute to humanitarian relief efforts and share the burden of sheltering and providing for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been forced to flee their homes. Only with immediate and decisive action from the international community can Syrians in Idlib be spared from the further devastation of war.']",
469,Satellite images show Iran building burial pits for coronavirus victims,"['Yes, satellite images have shown Iran is constructing burial pits for victims of the coronavirus. According to NPR, the government has erected a tent city outside of Tehran with dozens of pits to use for burials. Iranian authorities have not commented on the size of the pits or the number of burials they are expecting.  Satellite images appear to show Iran's government taking extraordinary steps to contain the coronavirus pandemic, including the construction of mass burial pits for the nation's growing number of victims. According to a Washington Post report, satellite images show construction taking place near a cemetery in the southeastern city of Ahvaz, where 114 people have already been buried in a separate section reserved for those who died from the virus. The images show that the mass graves are more than four times larger than the existing cemetery, which is believed to be the largest in the region. The pits will have room for up to 1,000 burials, the report said. Iran, one of the worst-affected countries in the world by the virus, has reported more than 37,000 coronavirus cases and 2,517 deaths.  Satellite images from Planet Labs show what appear to be two large burial pits near the city of Qom in Iran, which may be intended for coronavirus victims. The pits appear to be located in a desert area near the city’s airport, and could be used for large-scale burials of victims of the virus. The images were first reported by the Wall Street Journal and CNN, and have since been verified by other satellite imagery companies. The images show two large pits that are approximately 100 feet in length, and both are surrounded by raised berms. It is unclear if the pits have been used, or if they are intended to be used for coronavirus victims.']",
470,Bodies 'pile up' in morgue as Iran feels strain of coronavirus,"['The situation in Iran has become increasingly dire due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with reports emerging that bodies are piling up in the country’s morgues as hospitals become overwhelmed.  The Associated Press recently reported that the morgues in Tehran, Iran’s capital, were full and workers had resorted to piling bodies in the open on some days. The United Nations estimates that there are currently over 250,000 confirmed cases and 12,000 recorded deaths in the country.  The government has declared a two-week lockdown in an effort to curb the virus, but has refused to release the true numbers of infected people and deaths. Hospitals in the country have reported being unable to keep up with the influx of desperately sick patients.  The Iranian public also appears to be losing trust in the government’s handling of the outbreak, with many people accusing the authorities of not doing enough, including a lack of medical equipment and personnel.  Humanitarian aid organizations have warned that, due to the continued spread of the coronavirus, the situation in Iran will likely get worse before it gets better.  The coronavirus pandemic has caused a backlog of bodies in morgues across Iran, where authorities are struggling to contain the virus. Reports from the country say that an overwhelming number of deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has led to bodies piling up in morgues. In the province of Mazandaran, officials have erected a tent to store the overflow of corpses.  The situation has been compounded by a lack of resources and a surge in the number of cases. Since the outbreak began in February, Iran has been one of the hardest-hit countries in the world, with over 150,000 confirmed cases and more than 8,000 deaths. As the government has imposed stringent restrictions, hospitals have become overwhelmed and funeral and burial services have been disrupted.  The surge in cases has led to a shortage of hospital beds, as well as a lack of personnel and resources to cope with the crisis. This has resulted in a backlog of bodies in morgues, with some having to wait for days before being buried. Reports from the country say that many of the deceased are being transported in refrigerated containers due to the lack of capacity in morgues.  The situation has highlighted the strain that the coronavirus pandemic is having on Iran, and has raised questions about the government's response to the crisis. Health officials have warned that the situation could worsen in the coming weeks if the measures are not strictly followed.']",

Iranian officials said those freed would include people sentenced to short terms, prisoners who are elderly and those with underlying health conditions. The temporary release is expected to reduce the prison population by about 20 percent and is part of a broader effort to protect vulnerable populations from the virus, which has been particularly deadly in Iran. As of March 29, Iran had reported more than 25,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths, placing it among the hardest-hit countries in the world.  Iran's judiciary has announced that it will temporarily release 54,000 prisoners as part of measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The prisoners, including those convicted on economic charges and those serving short sentences, will be released on a temporary basis for three months. The country's judiciary chief, Ebrahim Raisi, said that those released would have to abide by the rules set out by the coronavirus task force or risk being sent back to prison. The decision was made in an effort to reduce overcrowding in prisons and protect inmates from the spread of the virus.   In addition to the temporary releases, the country will also allow inmates to speak to their families by phone, extend deadlines for payment of fines, and temporarily suspend imprisonment of those convicted of minor crimes. The judiciary is working with the government and the Ministry of Health to ensure inmates are monitored and receive necessary treatment if they become infected with the virus.   The move comes as Iran is one of the worst-affected countries by coronavirus, with over 55,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,400 deaths.  The country has stepped up its efforts to contain the spread of the virus by implementing social distancing measures, such as closing down schools, universities, and places of worship.']",

According to the IAEA’s report, Iran had stockpiled 1,023.9 kilograms of low-enriched uranium (LEU) as of May 2020—compared to the 202.8 kilograms of LEU it held as of November 2019. The IAEA also noted that Iran’s rate of uranium enrichment had increased significantly, with the country now producing LEU at a rate of approximately 10 kg per month. The report also confirmed that Iran is continuing to enrich uranium up to the 4.5 percent level, which is the limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal. The IAEA’s report has reignited concerns among some countries that Iran may be attempting to build nuclear weapons.  The head of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that Iran has nearly tripled its stockpile of enriched uranium since November. In a report issued on Monday, IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi said that Tehran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium now stands at about 1,020 kilograms. This is significantly higher than the 372 kilograms reported in November and well above the 300-kilogram limit set by the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).   The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that Iran has almost tripled its stockpile of low-enriched uranium since November of last year. This has caused international concern as it would be enough to make one nuclear bomb, should it be further enriched. However, it is still well below the amount needed for a bomb and IAEA has stated that Iran is still complying with the 2015 nuclear deal, which limits the amount of uranium enrichment.']",

Prime Minister Omar al-Razaz said in an interview with the Jordan Times that the plan, which was recently unveiled by Trump, could have ""dangerous implications"" for the two-decade-old treaty.  Specifically, Razaz said that the proposed plan gives Israel sweeping control over the Jordan Valley, a key security buffer zone for Jordan, as well as a disproportionately large amount of land for the establishment of a future Palestinian state.  He also said that the plan fails to take into account Jordan's role in ensuring the security of Israel, and that the lack of regional consultation around the plan could hurt regional unity.  Razaz reaffirmed Jordan’s commitment to the peace treaty with Israel and regional peace and stability, but warned that the plan could threaten the prospects for a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region.  Jordan’s Prime Minister Omar Razzaz has warned that US President Donald Trump’s proposed Middle East peace plan could jeopardize the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.  Razzaz told the Jordanian parliament on Tuesday that the “Deal of the Century” plan, which Trump is expected to unveil in the coming weeks, could put the treaty in “jeopardy”.  He said that the Jordan-Israel peace treaty should remain the basis of any plan and that any changes to its terms should be discussed and agreed upon by both countries.  Razzaz said that the US should respect Jordan’s position and the terms of the peace treaty, and that the Jordanian government would be alert and ready to “confront any attempt to undermine the two-state solution”.  Jordan has been a vocal critic of Trump’s plan, with Jordan’s King Abdullah II telling US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January that he saw no role for Washington in seeking a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.']",
474,"Israel's Netanyahu on course to win most seats, but may be short of majority","['According to the latest predictions from Israeli, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on track to win the most seats in the upcoming elections. However, it is not yet known whether he will be able to secure a majority needed to form a government, meaning he may have to form a coalition with smaller parties. Netanyahu has been in power since 2009 and is currently seeking a fourth term in office. Opinion polls have suggested he is likely to win the most seats, but whether he can secure a majority is still uncertain.  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be on course to win the most seats in Tuesday's election but may not have won enough to form a government with a majority of legislators.  Early exit polls showed Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party winning 30 to 33 seats in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. Netanyahu's main rival, the centrist Blue and White party, was expected to receive 28 to 32 seats.  While Likud was expected to win the most seats, it was still uncertain whether it would be able to form a 61-seat majority coalition with its allies and potential partners. The coalition-building process could take weeks, with Netanyahu likely having the first opportunity to form the government.  If Netanyahu succeeds in forming a majority coalition, it will mark the fifth time he will have become prime minister since 1996.  With nearly all the votes counted in Israel’s parliamentary elections, it appears Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on course to win the most seats in the Knesset, but he may fall short of the majority needed to form a government.  Overseas and absentee ballots have yet to be counted, which could change the overall results.  With 97% of the votes tabulated, Netanyahu’s traditional allies - his Likud party and the ultra-Orthodox parties - appear to be within striking distance of the majority needed to form a new government.  Netanyahu's challenger, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, appears to have fallen short of his goal of forming a new government with a 61-seat parliamentary majority.  The final results are expected Wednesday afternoon. If Netanyahu fails to win a majority, Israel could face a third election within a year.']",

However, exit polls suggest that his right-wing and religious bloc may be just short of the 61 seats needed for a majority. Netanyahu has signaled that he will seek to form a coalition government, and he may be able to do so with the help of smaller, religious factions.  While the Likud party has come out ahead in the election, the bloc of parties around it has not been able to garner enough support to form a solid majority. This could lead to weeks of negotiations as Netanyahu attempts to form a coalition.  The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu’s leadership and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Netanyahu has been heavily criticized for his handling of the crisis, with Israel having one of the highest infection rates in the world per capita.  Netanyahu has been in office for the past 11 years, making him the longest-serving leader in Israel's history. The election was widely viewed as a referendum on his leadership and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. If Netanyahu succeeds in forming a coalition government, he is likely to remain in power for the foreseeable future.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conservative Likud party are projected to win the Israeli election, according to an exit poll released Tuesday night.  Netanyahu is projected to receive 36 seats, just one short of a majority in the 120-seat Israeli Knesset. The center-left Blue and White party, led by former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, is projected to receive 33 seats.  The right-wing bloc of parties that Netanyahu leads is projected to receive 60 seats, just shy of the 61 needed to form a majority government. A coalition of parties on the left and in the center could form a coalition with the 61 seats needed to form a majority.  If Netanyahu can’t form a coalition, then Blue and White could be asked to form a coalition. That could push Netanyahu from power.  The official results won’t come until Wednesday evening. Until then, everything is still uncertain.']",

480,Once the Amazon rainforest passes the point of no return it could be gone in decades,"[', or even fewer. The forests are so vital to the planet, however, that scientists and environmental groups are working hard to prevent it from reaching that tipping point.  The Amazon rainforest houses several wildlife species, as well as producing oxygen and creating a vital balance to our planet’s climate. If it were to pass the point of no return, it could cause a tremendous imbalance to the planet’s climate and potentially lead to drastic changes in weather patterns and the destruction of thousands of species. In addition, it could cause a global shortage of freshwater due to the destruction of an essential water cycle component.  In order to prevent it from reaching this tipping point, efforts must be made to reduce deforestation and illegal logging as well as increase reforestation in the region. Governments, conservation groups, and citizens must come together to create a plan that can protect the Amazon rainforest and ensure its longevity. Additionally, educating people about the importance of the rainforest and its connection to global climate change will be essential in order to ensure that this vital resource remains intact., not centuries. The exact timeline depends on numerous environmental factors, such as deforestation rates, the effects of climate change, and the rate of natural regeneration. As the rainforest is destroyed, the region would become increasingly prone to drought and other extreme weather events, making it harder for plants and animals to survive. Additionally, with fewer trees and plants to absorb carbon dioxide, increased levels of carbon dioxide in the air will lead to global warming and other climate-change effects. As the Amazon rainforest continues to shrink, the world would lose many of its irreplaceable species and its immense biodiversity, impacting the global climate and the livelihoods of thousands of people who rely on the rainforest's resources.']",

The Chilean police believe that the gang had a well-organized plan, with the robbers driving off in three vehicles.  The Chilean Air Force and other law enforcement agencies quickly launched an investigation into the theft, with images of the robbers being shared on social media and a reward of up to $2 million being offered for information leading to their capture. As of yet, no arrests have been made, nor have any of the robbers been identified. It is believed that the stolen funds were part of a government cash transfer program that had been sent to the airport as part of efforts to help those most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The balance of power and resources, the very basis of much of daily life and existence, would be drastically changed. The labor force, the care-work sector, the educational system, and many other aspects of our lives would be drastically understaffed and under-resourced.   In this dystopian world, there would be a massive increase in gender-based violence due to the lack of female presence in the public sphere. Women would no longer have a voice to speak out against domestic abuse, sexual assault, and other forms of violence against women. The patriarchy would be rampant, with men continuing to dictate the terms of life and dictate the rules of society without consequence.  In Mexico, the absence of women would likely have a devastating effect on the social fabric. Women are typically the ones in charge of raising children, ensuring they have access to education and a safe and secure home. Without women, there would undoubtedly be an increase in poverty, unemployment, and violence.  In short, a world without women would be a dangerous one, with increased gender-based violence, poverty, and insecurity throughout Mexico and the world. A strike against gender violence is a necessary step towards a world where women are safe and respected, and it is imperative that all citizens stand with women in Mexico to make this a reality.  A world without women would be an unimaginable loss, a tragedy, and a sign of immense suffering and injustice. Without women, our societies would be missing half of its population, an essential group of people who have contributed immensely to the social, economic, and cultural life of the world.  Without women, our economy would suffer. Women make up a large proportion of the economic base in many countries, where they often play an important role in the informal economy, working in jobs that are often undervalued, or not even measured by statistics. Women also often work hard to provide for their families, often in ways that are not recognized by official systems or the law.  A world without women would also mean a decrease in creativity and innovation, with fewer contributions from the unique perspectives of women. Women have long been innovators of new technologies, businesses, and ideas that contribute to progress and society’s success.  But a world without women also means a world without safety and freedom. Gender violence, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, and exploitation, would increase as women become an easy target.

493,Rare white giraffes killed by poachers at Kenyan wildlife sanctuary,"['It is with great sadness that we report that a pair of rare white giraffes, the only known ones in the world, have been killed by poachers at a Kenyan wildlife sanctuary. The female and her calf had been living in the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy in Garissa County, in the northeast of the country.  The conservationists who manage the sanctuary became aware of the killings on Tuesday, when they found the carcasses of the giraffes, which they believed to have been shot with a high-caliber weapon.  The white color of these animals is caused by a genetic condition called leucism, which affects only the pigmentation and leaves the skin of the animals unpigmented. Even though the condition is genetic, the conservationists fear poachers could have targeted these animals for the unique coloration.  The Hirola Conservation Program has started an investigation to find out who was responsible for the killings. The conservationists have asked the public to help identify the culprit and bring them to justice. They are also urging local communities to be on the lookout for any suspicious activities and report them to the authorities.  We hope that justice is served swiftly and those responsible are held accountable for their actions. Our condolences go out to the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy and the families of the two white giraffes.  It is with great sadness and outrage that we report that two rare white giraffes were recently killed by poachers in Kenya. The white giraffes, a mother and child, were found killed by poachers at the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy, located in the Ijara District of Garissa County, Kenya.  The white giraffes were considered a rare sight and a source of local pride. They had been spotted on and off in Kenya since 2016, but it is believed that this family was the only known pair of white giraffes in the area.  The poachers are believed to have killed the giraffes in pursuit of their valuable hides and meat. In a sad twist, the giraffes had been fitted with radio collars just two weeks prior to their deaths in order to track their movements.  We urge governments and wildlife organizations to step up anti-poaching measures, increase surveillance of wildlife reserves, and do their utmost to protect endangered wildlife. The loss of these two giraffes is a tragedy and a reminder of how vigilant we must all be in order to protect the world’s remaining animal species.']",

Legal representatives of the Prime Minister argued that Thabane should be granted absolute immunity from prosecution because he is the Prime Minister of Lesotho, and that the prosecution of him for the alleged murder of his wife would be politically motivated.  The High Court did not make a ruling on Tuesday and is expected to hear further arguments from both sides in the coming weeks.

500,"African countries at severe risk if outbreaks aren't detected early, says Africa CDC head","['Countries in Africa that are most easily affected by the spread of infectious diseases and without early detection are at the highest risk. These include countries with weak health systems such as Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Burundi, and South Sudan. These countries have limited resources, inadequate health infrastructure, and face significant socio-economic challenges. Early detection and containment of outbreaks is critical in order to mitigate their spread and prevent further suffering.  Countries at particular risk for the spread of infectious diseases include Ethiopia, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Uganda. These countries have some of the weakest health systems in Africa and lack the resources to identify and respond quickly to disease outbreaks. Early detection and response are essential to contain outbreaks and prevent them from spreading further. Investing in systems to strengthen surveillance, rapid response, and preparedness capacity is key to prevent and control public health emergencies.  Countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Guinea are at a particularly high risk of experiencing severe outbreaks of infectious diseases if they’re not detected and managed early. These countries have weaker health systems, limited access to healthcare, a lack of critical medical infrastructure, inadequate resources and a large vulnerable population – all of which present a huge challenge in containing and mitigating the spread of disease. In addition to these challenges, these countries have limitations in the ability to detect and respond to potential outbreaks due to the lack of trained medical personnel and surveillance systems. This increases the risk of an outbreak developing into a major health crisis, one that could easily overwhelm the health system and cause preventable deaths in the communities. The Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) is working closely with these countries to strengthen their health systems, expand their surveillance systems, build capacity for early detection and response, and support the provision of quality healthcare for all.']",

546,Nathaniel Hendren says Katlyn Alix knew risk in Russian Roulette-style game that killed her,"['At the time of her death, Katlyn Alix had reportedly agreed to play a game of Russian roulette with Nathaniel Hendren, the man who has been charged in her shooting death. According to authorities, Katlyn had willingly put a bullet in the cylinder of the revolver and spun it before handing it off to Nathaniel, who then pulled the trigger.

547,Suburban officials want to ditch red light camera company after corruption case,"['Suburban officials are likely to ditch a red light camera company after a corruption case revealed a bribery scheme involving company employees and local traffic engineers. The revelations highlighted the need to ensure public contracts are conducted with transparency and integrity and to make sure public safety is ensured. Officials who are responsible for the contract must examine their past practices and determine what can be done to improve the system of selecting contractors, negotiating contracts, and monitoring the performance of the contractors.  Suburban officials may be looking to sever ties with a red light camera company after a corruption case involving the company emerged. In the case, the company is alleged to have bribed several public officials in order to secure contracts for its services. In response, local officials have expressed concerns about the potential implications of the case and are now considering whether to terminate their contracts with the company. Depending on the severity of the allegations, they may also choose to take further disciplinary action against the officials involved. In any case, the scandal has highlighted the need for tight oversight and accountability when it comes to public contracts.  Suburban officials around the country are closely monitoring developments in a major federal corruption case against the parent company of a red-light camera firm as they consider whether to jettison the firm's services.  The case has raised questions about the ethics of red-light camera companies and whether such firms should be allowed to operate in municipalities at all. The Chicago-based SafeSpeed LLC, owned by the company RedFlex, was caught up in a bribery probe involving the city of Columbus, Ohio’s red light camera contract.   The company has been suspended from operating any traffic enforcement cameras in the state of Ohio. Following the news, numerous municipalities have cancelled their contracts with Redflex over concerns about their integrity.  In order to make sure their communities don't become embroiled in similar legal issues, many local governments are reviewing their own contracts and taking a closer look at the red-light camera companies they are doing business with. Although municipalities may choose to keep RedFlex on their rosters, they will likely closely monitor their operations and make sure the company is adhering to the highest ethical standards.   Many local leaders are also exploring other alternatives, such as using crash data to inform traffic enforcement initiatives, which could reduce the need for red-light cameras.   The outcome of the case against RedFlex could have long-term implications for its business as many government officials may be hesitant to continue working with the firm if it is found guilty of corruption.']",

551,Judge overturns Utah death row inmate Von Lester Taylor's double murder conviction,"['On June 24th, 2020, a Utah judge ordered the reversal of Von Lester Taylor's double murder conviction in the 1998 shooting of two men in Salt Lake City, citing evidence that was withheld at trial and ineffective representation by his attorneys. Taylor was sentenced to death in 2001 after he was convicted of shooting two men multiple times while they were in their car. The judge ruled that the state withheld evidence that could have supported Taylor's argument of self-defense, and that his attorneys did not adequately represent him at trial. Now, Taylor's conviction has been reversed and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings. According to court documents, Taylor maintains his innocence and has said that he was protecting himself when the shooting occurred.  On Tuesday, a judge overturned the double murder conviction of Von Lester Taylor – a Utah death row inmate who has been on death row since 1995.  Judge Andrew H. Stone of the Utah Court of Appeals ordered the 3rd District Court to set aside Taylor’s conviction and death sentence, finding that the jury instructions given in his case were “plainly erroneous.”  Taylor was convicted in 1995 for the 1994 murders of Leah Brown, 21, and Jon Holcomb, 20, in Utah County. Taylor became the only person in Utah to be sentenced to death for a crime committed before the state’s death penalty law was changed in 1996 to make it easier to impose capital punishment.  Judge Stone found that the jury instructions in Taylor’s case were inadequate because they did not explain to the jury the difference between premeditated murder (which is punishable by the death penalty in Utah) and felony murder (which is not punishable by the death penalty). In his decision, he wrote that “it is constitutionally impermissible for a state to execute someone for a crime they did not understand they committed.”  The Utah Attorney General’s Office plans to appeal the ruling, which could send the case back to the trial court for a possible retrial.']",

553,Private event industry hit hard in midst of ban on large gatherings in Oregon,"['The event industry in Oregon has been particularly hard hit by COVID-19 due to a statewide ban on large gatherings. This law, which was put into place in March in response to the pandemic, has caused a significant decline in the number of private events, such as weddings, corporate functions and other gatherings, held in Oregon.  As the pandemic continues, the event industry is facing an uncertain future, as it is unclear when the ban on large gatherings will lift and when private events will be able to resume. In the meantime, event industry workers are being laid off, venues are struggling to stay afloat, and many events have had to be canceled or postponed indefinitely. Additionally, many couples who had planned to get married in 2020 have had to delay their nuptials until a later date.  The event industry in Oregon is in a precarious position, as there is currently no end in sight for the ban on large gatherings. Despite this, many people in the industry remain hopeful that private events can resume soon, allowing them to get back to work and for couples to have the weddings of their dreams.  The event industry, particularly private events such as weddings, birthday and anniversary parties, corporate events and other non-commercial events, has suffered significantly due to the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent ban on large gatherings. The ban has impacted the livelihoods of event planners, venues, caterers, DJs, florists and other vendors, who are all unable to make money while the ban is in place.   For those that have managed to hang on and remain open, they have had to adapt quickly to the changing environment. Some have begun to offer virtual events and other creative ideas, such as hosting socially-distant events with smaller numbers of people. Others have diversified their services to offer things like online workshops, online classes, and food delivery services.   The pandemic has put a major strain on the event industry, and it may take some time for it to recover. Many private events have had to be postponed or cancelled, and refunds have had to be issued. This has caused a significant financial strain for many of the vendors and event planners who rely on these events for their income.   It is uncertain as to when the ban on large gatherings and events will be lifted, but for now, event vendors and planners have had to get creative in order to stay afloat. Hopefully the industry will be able to recover quickly and resume normal operations once the ban is lifted.']",

The NBA, which relies heavily on television broadcast rights and ticket sales for revenue, is facing a major setback if the season is delayed for an extended period of time. With no games being played, the league has already lost millions of dollars in potential TV broadcast and ticket revenue.

Trump has also called for the repeal of the use of the FISA court for warrants, which many civil libertarians argue could be used to circumvent constitutional due process guarantees.  Trump's responses to the coronavirus pandemic have also caused anxiety on Capitol Hill. Trump and his administration have been criticized for not taking the virus seriously in the early days of the pandemic, for attempting to downplay and politicize the spread of the virus, and for failing to lead a comprehensive national response. He has also been accused of pressuring states to prematurely reopen businesses, which some experts believe could lead to greater spread of the illness. The president has also held rallies with large crowds despite warnings from health experts and has often contradicted the advice of his own public health officials.  President Donald Trump has taken a hard stance on certain surveillance policies through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and responded to the coronavirus pandemic in ways that have caused considerable anxiety on Capitol Hill.  Trump has pushed for reforms to the FISA process, arguing that the law, which allows for foreign intelligence gathering, has been abused by intelligence officials. In March 2020 he called for the reforms to ensure that “the rightful privacy rights of all Americans are fully respected.”  Despite calls from members of Congress and public health experts, Trump has hesitated to take strong, decisive action to address the coronavirus pandemic.

Over the weekend, Trump tested negative for coronavirus and his doctor said the President is not contagious and there is no need for him to be tested again.  However, the White House has indicated that it is considering additional testing for the President in the near future.  If Trump were to get a second test, it could indicate the level of spread and the effectiveness of public health measures the President and his administration have taken to combat the virus. The White House has said it would be a ""very good thing"" if the President were to get a negative result, meaning there are fewer people in the community with the virus and the infection rate is declining.  Given the President's frequent interactions with people, a second negative test could also help to allay worries of a potential outbreak at the White House, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of the White House's contact tracing program.

580,Why it matters A LOT that Trump hasn't been tested for coronavirus,"['It matters a lot that President Trump has not been officially tested for the coronavirus for a few reasons. First, as the leader of the country, it is important for the President to model good behavior and follow the same protocols that he is asking of the general public. His decision not to be tested could be interpreted as a lack of concern for the seriousness of the virus and could undermine the importance of social distancing measures that have been implemented by the government. Second, if he were to contract the virus and show symptoms, it would be difficult to trace his contacts and make sure that anyone he had been in contact with was tested and quarantined in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Finally, his refusal to be tested could be viewed as an act of denial about the severity of the situation, which could further deter people from taking the virus seriously and following instructions from the government and health care professionals.  It matters a lot that President Trump has not been tested for coronavirus because he is the leader of the United States and the public relies on him for guidance on how to handle the virus. If President Trump were to be tested for coronavirus and had the virus, it would be a sign that the virus is even more widespread than previously thought, and his infection would set a concerning example for the nation. It would also be concerning as President Trump is frequently seen in public and has made contact with many people, both in the White House and elsewhere, meaning his potential infection could further spread the virus. Knowing whether or not the President is infected would also give the public a better idea of the effectiveness of preventative measures being taken, as President Trump has access to the best resources and preventative services available.']",
581,Health officials often turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions,"['Health officials often do not turn to praising Trump when facing tough coronavirus questions. Instead, they focus on providing facts and advice about the virus and how best to confront it. While some health officials may mention Trump's support for certain strategies and initiatives, this is usually done in a factual rather than effusive manner. In addition, health officials often take the opportunity to emphasize the importance of following scientifically proven strategies to prevent the spread of the virus, rather than praising the president.  Health officials often turn to praising President Trump when facing tough questions about the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. This may be done in an effort to appear non-partisan and show their support for the president's efforts. They also might be trying to deflect criticism or show that they are focused on their individual objectives instead of the larger political context.  It is not uncommon for health officials to turn to praising President Trump when faced with tough questions about the coronavirus pandemic. This is often done as a way to deflect uncomfortable questions about the government's response to the pandemic. It is also seen as a way to show support for the President, which could potentially be advantageous when it comes to receiving resources or funding needed to fight the virus.']",
582,Here's what Trump's coronavirus emergency declaration does,"[', and doesn't do  President Donald Trump's emergency declaration will free up an estimated $50 billion in federal aid for states, local governments, and tribal governments to use to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. It will also allow the federal government to provide more funding, if needed, to pay for medical equipment and supplies, as well as hiring additional personnel in the health care system.  The emergency declaration will also unlock additional resources under the Stafford Act, a law that allows the federal government to give money to state and local governments for natural disasters. This money can be used to cover expenses like medical supplies, housing for vulnerable populations, and transportation.   The declaration does not, however, provide funding for paid sick leave for workers affected by the outbreak and it does not provide direct aid to individuals or families struggling financially due to the outbreak. It also does not provide any additional legal authority to local or state governments to alter their operations or impose new restrictions.   President Trump's emergency declaration for the coronavirus pandemic will free up $50 billion for state and local governments to combat the outbreak. It also gives states more flexibility in spending existing federal money from the disaster relief fund, such as for creating new temporary hospitals, expanding medical infrastructure, and procuring medical supplies. The federal government will also be able to tap into additional funding sources, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget.  The declaration also triggers the Stafford Act, which will allow state, local, and tribal governments to request specific types of federal aid to help fight the virus. That includes allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to provide grants and loans to health care providers and making it easier for state and local governments to access federal funds.  Finally, the emergency declaration also grants the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) the authority to provide support for state and local emergency management officials, such as providing medical equipment, temporary housing, and other support.

Biden has sought to bring Sanders’ supporters into the fold by expressing agreement on policy issues and emphasizing his admiration for his former rival, but he must do more to win them over completely. To do this, Biden will need to focus on what he can offer that Sanders could not: a more centrist approach to governing that may be more palatable to some moderates and disaffected Republicans. He must also emphasize a more united front against President Trump, which could be appealing to Sanders’ supporters who are fed up with Trump and his policies. To win over Sanders’ supporters, Biden must show them that he understands and respects their values, that he is capable of advancing those values through sensible policy, and that he can unite the party behind him.  Joe Biden has a steep hill to climb to secure the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden has consistently led the delegate race so far, but he must now bring the supporters of former rival Bernie Sanders into the fold in order to secure the nomination and beat President Donald Trump in November's election. To win over Sanders' supporters, Biden must focus on convincing them of his commitment to progressive policies and his ability to unify the Democratic Party. He must also be willing to compromise on some of his policies and work to ensure Sanders' voice is heard in the Democratic Party going forward.

586,North Korea has launched at least three unidentified projectiles,"[', according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The launch comes after months of stalled disarmament talks between the U.S. and North Korea.  The projectiles were launched from Wonsan, a city on the east coast of North Korea, into the East Sea. The South Korean military is currently monitoring the situation and analyzing flight data to determine the type of projectiles that were launched.  The launch comes amidst stalled disarmament talks between the U.S. and North Korea which appeared to be ending when U.S. President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Since then, North Korea has refrained from nuclear and missile tests, despite U.S. efforts to build diplomatic relations.  The launch also comes shortly after Trump met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Seoul, where the two leaders discussed potential progress on talks with North Korea.  These launches could be a sign that North Korea is growing frustrated with the current lack of progress in talks, and is attempting to pressure the U.S. into resuming negotiations. It could also be an attempt to test new missile systems or other military hardware. off its eastern coast early Thursday.  It is the latest in a series of weapons tests by the North in recent months and comes after officials in Pyongyang said the country was in the final stages of preparedness to conduct another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test.

It is unclear what kind of projectile was launched, though some reports suggested they could be a type of ballistic missile. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency cited an unidentified military source as saying the North had fired two short-range ballistic missiles.

But his Future Forward Party was dissolved by Thailand's constitutional court on February 21 and, just days later, police issued an arrest warrant for Mr Thanathorn on sedition and computer crimes charges.

He was later stripped of his MP status over the speech, but at the time he defiantly vowed to fight on.

596,They plan to march for gender equality. In Pakistan,"[', there is a need for greater gender equality in many areas. Unfortunately, gender equality is still an uphill battle in Pakistan, with limited legal protections and a society still divided on the issue. Therefore, marching for gender equality is a great way to show solidarity to the cause and help spread awareness of the issues. It is also a great way to bring people together to collectively demand change. The march could include speeches, rallies, and other activities which would be used to raise awareness and push for greater gender equality., the movement for gender equality has been led by various activists and organizations who have campaigned to create awareness, build public opinion and advocate for legislative changes in the country. This has included advocating against gender-based violence, promoting economic and educational opportunities for women, and working to bring about social and cultural shifts. In recent years, the Women's March in Pakistan has become a prominent event, with thousands of women marching in solidarity for gender equality and raising awareness about these issues., where the gender gap is especially profound, marching for gender equality is an effective way to make change and raise awareness. The first step is to find allies, both organizations and individuals, who are already advocating for gender equality in Pakistan. They can then work together to plan a march in a public space and use social media and other platforms to spread their message. There are a few things to keep in mind when planning such an event:   1. Assess the risks: It’s important to conduct risk assessments beforehand to identify potential risks such as counter-protests, physical violence, and legal repercussions.  2. Invite allies: Invite organizations, activists, and allies to join the march. This will help increase numbers and create a sense of solidarity.  3. Choose an appropriate route: Select a route that is safe and accessible for marchers.  4. Choose a day and time: Choose a day and time that works best for the majority of marchers. Daytime marches may get more attention but nighttime marches may be safer for marchers.  5. Prepare a ‘call to action’: Pick a few specific calls to action to focus on during the march. These should be specific and achievable goals around gender equality.  6. Get the word out: Use social media, print media, radio, and other platforms to spread the word about the march.   7. Provide security: Safety is a top priority, so it’s important to make sure there is adequate security, especially if counter-protests are expected.  8. Have a plan: Have a plan of action in case of an emergency. This could include having a buddy system, having an emergency contact or a phone number, and having a meeting place in case marchers get separated.']",

For more than 20 years, he has been keeping Macao's maritime past alive – in miniature. While Macao has a long history of boat and shipbuilding, the industry has all but disappeared in recent years. Cheong is the last known shipbuilder in the city and is dedicated to creating models of Macao's traditional ships, from elegant Chinese junks to sturdy Portuguese trading vessels.  Cheong uses traditional methods of construction. He begins by sourcing the best quality wood – usually rosewood or Chinese mahogany – before carefully crafting the planks, masts, sails and other components of his miniature boats. He then painstakingly assembles the model, glueing, screwing and nailing each piece in place, before finishing off the model with paint and detailing.  The result is a beautiful, carefully crafted piece of history that Cheong can be proud of. He believes that by building these models, he is not only keeping the memory of Macao’s maritime past alive, but also passing the traditional craft to future generations.  Macao's master shipbuilder, Ng Shun-cheong, is keeping the city's maritime past alive through the delicate process of creating model ships by hand. Working in a small shop in the heart of the city, Ng has been crafting miniature boats from simple materials for nearly five decades. Using scraps of wood and plastic, Ng works with a steady hand, representing with accuracy the rigging, lines, and scales of ancient boats, from merchant ships to fishing boats.  Ng's skills have been passed on to him through generations of shipbuilders and have been recognized by the local government, which has provided him with an official apprenticeship program and a permanent exhibition of his work within the city.  Despite his advanced age, Ng remains dedicated to the craft and has no plans to retire. Through his meticulous work, Ng ensures that Macao's maritime heritage is never forgotten and always appreciated. For this, his model boats are a symbol of perseverance and of the city's commitment to preserving its past.']",

It was designed by the Vietnamese architect Dang Viet Nga and was completed in 1990. It is described as an ""architecture of the imagination"" and is considered to be one of the best examples of 'Organic architecture' in Vietnam.  The eccentric design of the Crazy House is inspired by nature. The building itself resembles a giant tree, with each room resembling a hollowed-out beehive or giant bird's nest. Staircases, bridges, and other spaces between rooms form a labyrinthine of passages giving the impression of being inside a fairytale. The building is decorated with both humorous and surreal sculptures, making it a haven for photographers and artists.  The Crazy House is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, and it is said to be a great place for inspiration and relaxation. Not only is it a great place to stay for a night or two, but it also serves delicious food, providing a unique and memorable experience.  Designed by the local artist Dang Viet Nga and built in the early 1990s, Vietnam’s Crazy House, also known as Hang Nga Guesthouse and Art Gallery, is described as a surrealist, Alice-in-Wonderland style in the jungle of Dalat. This landmark is a unique combination of fantasy and organic architecture where guests can explore a complex network of treehouses, caves, tunnels, secret rooms, and abstract animal sculptures.  Viet Nga first created the concept of the Crazy House in her imagination, then carefully designed it and constructed it with the help of her father, a trained architect. The building's organic form was inspired by Viet Nga's fascination with nature, which she wanted to express in an architectural form. She combined both traditional and modern architecture in an unexpected way, which became known as “Organi-Conditionalism”.  The Crazy House has been both admired and criticized since its completion. Many people find the building's surrealist and dreamlike atmosphere captivating, and have praised the artist for her creativity and artistic vision. Others have been critical of the structure for its lack of practicality and for its potential for danger, as the building is somewhat unstable and the pathways between balconies and stairways can be difficult to navigate.  Despite the criticisms, the Crazy House has become a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over the world. It has been featured on several television shows and was even chosen to be a filming location for the movie “Troy”. It has come to represent both the striking architecture of Vietnam and the country’s embrace of creative expression.']",

622,Why oil prices are crashing and what it means,"['Oil prices have been crashing due to a combination of supply and demand factors. First, oil demand has been reduced due to the economic contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders have drastically reduced the demand for transportation fuels. Secondly, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies failed to reach an agreement that would reduce production and support oil prices. This has resulted in an oversupply situation in the global oil market, putting downward pressure on prices.   The fall in oil prices can have significant implications for the global economy. Cheaper oil may provide relief for consumers, but it is bad news for oil producing nations and oil companies. These countries and companies are likely to suffer from reduced income due to lower oil prices. There is also the risk of deflationary pressures, as lower oil prices can lead to a decrease in consumer prices, making goods and services less expensive. Finally, lower oil prices can lead to a decrease in investments in renewable energy, as it will become less competitive compared to oil.  Oil prices are crashing due to a combination of factors. Firstly, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, global economic activity has been significantly weakened and demand for oil has decreased as factories, businesses and transportation services are closed or scaled back. Additionally, a price war has started between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s largest oil producers, resulting in an oversupply of oil in the market and rapidly-falling prices.   The crash in oil prices means that most consumers will benefit from lower prices at the pump and in other ways, such as lower costs for businesses. However, industry sectors that are heavily dependent on oil, like airlines and oil and gas companies, will suffer as their profit margins are reduced. Lower prices will also lead to lower government revenues, less investment, and job losses in some areas. Finally, lower prices are likely to increase global emissions as the incentive to move towards renewable energy sources is weakened.']",

Additionally, local residents can help by planting trees in their own yards, supporting initiatives to replant trees in public areas, and volunteering to water and care for city trees. Lastly, cutting down trees should be a last resort, and only done if there is a valid reason and if other options aren't available.  Trees are a vital part of our environment as they provide oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, reduce air pollution, provide habitats for wildlife, and help moderate the climate. It’s estimated that the US loses 36 million trees a year due to development, disease, insects, and other factors, which can have a negative impact on our environment.  The loss of trees is alarming because they are essential to our survival and the health of our planet. With the loss of trees, we can experience intense heat waves and flooding, as trees provide shade and absorb water. We can also experience higher levels of air pollution. Trees also provide important wildlife habitats, many of which are now disappearing due to development and deforestation.  Fortunately, tree loss can be prevented. Communities can plant trees, protect existing forests, and create laws to prevent further destruction. Individuals can help by donating to organizations that plant trees, volunteering to plant trees in their own neighborhoods, and supporting laws that protect against tree destruction. We can also all make an effort to reduce our consumption of wood and paper products to help lessen the destruction of existing forests. If we all work together, we can make a difference and help save our trees and our planet.']",
625,Rising seas are turning Miami's high ground into hot property,"['As rising sea levels continue to threaten coastal cities around the world, Miami is turning its high ground into hot property. Already, developers and investors are buying up land at higher elevations in Miami-Dade County, hoping to benefit from both current and future flooding conditions. At the same time, the city is making plans to reshape its infrastructure and shorelines to better accommodate rising waters. By investing in land above sea level, developers and investors are looking to capitalize on both current market conditions and the long-term effects of climate change.  Miami's high ground is becoming increasingly valuable as sea levels rise due to climate change, making it the most sought-after real estate in the city. As sea levels creep up, low-lying coastline properties are flooding with more regularity. This has created an increased demand for ground located higher up, in the form of single-family homes on elevated lots, condominiums in high-rise buildings, and other real estate investments. The surge in demand has driven up prices for high ground properties, with waterfront lots being especially expensive. Acknowledging the effects of climate change, investors are flocking to higher ground as a hedge against further flooding.  Rising seas are making real estate on Miami's higher ground increasingly desirable. Miami is a low-lying coastal city that is very prone to flooding and is facing the brunt of climate change. As sea levels continue to rise, it makes sense for people and businesses to purchase real estate closer to elevation. In addition to being a more desirable location for potential homeowners, higher ground can also provide a valuable competitive advantage for businesses. Higher ground can also provide some form of protection from potential flooding or storm surges. As a result, Miami's higher ground has become a much sought-after commodity, with prices steadily increasing.']",
626,Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"['Rich people have the power to help save the planet from climate change in many ways. Many of these methods involve using their money, influence, and resources to invest in green solutions and create a sustainable future.  For example, rich people can invest in green energy sources, like solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower, to reduce the amount of emissions from fossil fuels. They can also research and develop more efficient energy sources.  Additionally, rich people can use their money to support public initiatives and campaigns that promote climate protection. They can create and fund scholarships for students studying in green fields or even hire lobbyists to push for green policies.   Rich people can also reduce their own environmental footprint by using less electricity and water in their homes, taking greener transportation, and eating more sustainable foods.   Finally, they can use their influence and resources to advocate for climate action and rally support from other wealthy people to join in the fight.   By taking all of these steps, rich people can be instrumental in helping to save the planet from climate change.  Rich people can help save the planet from climate change by taking individual actions to reduce their own carbon footprints. This could include investing in renewable energies such as solar and wind power, using public transportation or electric cars and avoiding air travel when possible. They could also use their influence and wealth to support measures that encourage the adoption of clean energy and green technologies. Finally, wealthy individuals could also use their resources to fund research, education and advocacy efforts aimed at combating climate change.']",

633,The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games,"['The tourism legacy of the Olympic Games can be incredibly positive and long-lasting. The event often raises the profile of the host city, can increase economic activity through increased visitor spending, and can also boost the local sport sector. Additionally, the infrastructure and facilities created for the Games can often be repurposed for long-term, post-Olympic use. The Olympics can also spur greater investment in the city’s tourism infrastructure, from improved airports and transport links to the construction of new attractions. The event can also build a positive legacy of legacy of international understanding, civic pride and a culture of volunteering.  The Olympic Games have left a major legacy in the tourism industry. While most of the attention is usually given to the sporting achievements of the host nation, the legacy of the Games has a lasting impact on the tourism industry.  The most immediate impact of the Olympic Games is on the local destination. Host cities often experience a huge influx of tourists who come to visit the Olympic venues and watch the events. This influx of tourists can be an economic boon for the host city, as hotels and restaurants are full, airports are busy, and souvenir shops and stands are popping up. In addition to the direct impact of the event itself, many cities also use the Olympics to launch and promote major investment projects, such as the construction of new hotels, public transportation infrastructure and roads.  Furthermore, hosting the Olympics can create a lasting reputation as an international destination. Major events like the Olympics often attract media attention, which in turn can bring exposure to the host city, increasing tourist visits and investment in the years ahead. Additionally, the experience of hosting the Olympics often prompts cities to invest in new infrastructure and public amenities, creating higher standards of living and more appealing destinations for travelers.  In the long run, hosting the Olympic Games can create a lasting legacy that transcends the immediate benefits of tourism. The experience of hosting the event can create a sense of pride and civic engagement, boosting morale and leading to greater participation in both sports and cultural activities. The legacy of the Olympic Games also often includes an increase in cultural awareness, as different nations and cultures come together in a celebration of sport and unity.']",

637,How this outbreak is adding to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies,"['The coronavirus pandemic has created a huge amount of uncertainty in the international arena. As military forces around the world shift their focus away from traditional security challenges and towards COVID-19 mitigation efforts, the risk of miscalculations between rivals is heightened. With rivals seeing each other as weaker due to their focus on the outbreak, they may be more likely to take escalatory action. Furthermore, countries are engaging in economic competition over scarce resources, increasing the risk of economic warfare. This could lead to an increased use of cyber weapons and conventional military platforms, which could increase the risk of miscalculation and accidental escalation.  The outbreak of a deadly virus such as COVID-19 adds to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies in two ways. Firstly, powers may overestimate the capabilities of their enemies in containing the virus, leading to military posturing or other provocative actions. Secondly, the economic and social impacts of the outbreak may lead to destabilization and political unrest, which may make enemies more likely to act out. This adds to the risk of miscalculation and the potential for conflict.  The coronavirus outbreak is adding to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies, as it is leading to a strained and unpredictable global environment. With tensions already high between major powers such as China, the United States and Russia, the current crisis is increasing the risk of competing interpretations and misinterpretations of the other side’s actions and intentions. With less communication and understanding between all parties, there is an increased chance of misinterpretation and inaccurate assumption of intentions, potentially leading to further escalation and conflict with catastrophic consequences.']",

642,In Earth's early history,"[', the atmosphere was primarily composed of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. This early atmosphere was much denser and warmer due to high levels of carbon dioxide, which acted as a greenhouse gas. The concentration of carbon dioxide gradually decreased as photosynthesis began to produce oxygen, forming the present-day atmosphere. This new atmosphere contained much lower levels of carbon dioxide and higher levels of oxygen, allowing for the development of aerobic organisms and complex life., the planet was a much different place than it is today. The atmosphere was largely composed of methane, ammonia and carbon dioxide, the oceans were primarily composed of water vapor, and the surface of the planet was mostly covered in molten rock. The temperature of the planet was also much hotter than it is today, reaching temperatures of up to 1000°C in some places. Additionally, the planet was subject to frequent bombardments from asteroids and comets, which provided much of the material that would eventually form the Earth's crust., the Earth was a hot, hazardous, energetic place. High temperature and the lack of an atmosphere made it difficult for life to form. Earth's first atmosphere was composed of gases like ammonia, methane, water vapor and hydrogen sulfide. Early Earth lacked oxygen, leading to an environment inhospitable for current life forms.  The Earth began to cool about 4.4 billion years ago when enough heat had dissipated into space. As Earth cooled, the energy from intense volcanism and meteorite impacts created a humid, steamy atmosphere. Water droplets in the atmosphere began condensing and forming clouds, leading to subsequent rain and the formation of oceans.  Eventually the Earth's atmosphere changed and stabilized to what it is today. Ozone was created, blocking out harmful radiation from the sun. Oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, making it hospitable for the development of modern life forms. The presence of oxygen combined with the Earth's magnetic field also helped protect the planet from further meteor strikes, further promoting the development of life on Earth.']",

647,Italy is a test of how a Western economy bear an almost-total shutdown,"['as efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus. The country implemented a nationwide lockdown on 9 March 2020, taking particularly strict measures to contain the virus, such as closing all non-essential businesses and banning people from leaving their homes except for essential activities. This led to a rapid collapse of economic activity and a contraction in GDP of 8.9% in 2020.  The government has taken steps to help the Italian economy recover, such as providing tax breaks and subsidies to businesses, expanding social welfare programs and introducing a jobs support plan. However, the future of the Italian economy remains uncertain due to concerns over the potential second wave of pandemic and its impact on consumer spending and business confidence.  The effects of an almost-total shutdown in Italy offers an example of how a Western economy can bear the burden of such measures in the face of a pandemic. The Italian economy has contracted significantly in the first quarter of 2020 due to the shutdown, with the Italian economy shrinking by 5.4%. This recession is the largest in the Eurozone area since 2009.  The Italian government has put in place several measures in order to cushion the blow from the shutdown. These measures include tax reduction, liquidity injections, capital injections, debt moratoriums, and increased grant aid. These measures are intended to help support businesses, prevent job losses, and support those who are suffering financially due to the crisis.  At the same time, the Italian government has also stressed the importance of restarting the economy as soon as possible, and has put in place measures to this end. Reopening plans vary by region, but the overall idea is to gradually relax the restrictions while still taking into account the risk of the virus spreading.  In conclusion, the Italian government's efforts to mitigate the impact of the shutdown offer a clear example of how a Western economy can bear the burden of such measures in the face of a pandemic. Through the combination of financial support and gradual reopening plans, Italy is managing to find the delicate balance between protecting the public health and ensuring economic stability.']",

Speaking at the Women in the World Summit in New York, Berners-Lee called for greater efforts to make the web more inclusive and accessible to all genders, particularly focusing on topics such as privacy, safety, and economic opportunities. He noted that while the internet has provided huge benefits to many, it still has not delivered on its promise to provide a level playing field for women and girls.  The inventor of the web highlighted the persistent digital divide, which continues to leave women and girls without adequate internet access, education, and economic opportunities. He explained that this digital gap may have huge implications for the future, citing that a recent survey found that only one in five girls between the age of 13 and 17 feel confident using digital technologies.  He urged that organisations, governments, and tech companies must join forces to bridge the digital divide and make the web more equitable. New regulations should be introduced that protect people’s privacy and safety, as well as initiatives that promote digital literacy and create more economic opportunities for women.  By taking these steps, Berners-Lee argued, we can ensure that everyone can benefit from and contribute to the internet, allowing women and girls to achieve their potential and finally bring the web closer to its true potential.']",

The two men were sentenced to two years and one year in prison, respectively.   The two men had been running a fraudulent scheme since 2018, when they began impersonating the French finance minister and his assistant. They used their false identities to solicit money from a number of individuals, falsely claiming that they could provide access to government aid and contracts.   The fraudsters were arrested in 2019 and have since been charged with criminal conspiracy, counterfeiting, and forgery. They have been found guilty and will now face the consequences of their actions.   The case is yet another reminder that scamming is a serious matter and that fraudsters often receive hefty prison terms for their crimes. It is important for everyone to remain vigilant and to be wary of those attempting to scam them, no matter who they claim to be.  In 2018, three French fraudsters were sentenced to prison after trying to impersonate French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The trio, identified only as Arthur, Mehdi and Arslan, had called a number of companies and government departments and posed as the minister in an attempt to get the recipients to transfer money to their accounts.

651,Mars rover expected to launch this year delayed until 2022,"['NASA's Mars 2020 mission, which was slated to launch this July, has been delayed until 2022 after the coronavirus pandemic caused delays in testing the spacecraft. The mission is intended to send a robotic rover to explore Mars' surface and search for signs of past microbial life.  NASA officials said the delay was necessary to ensure the mission would be a success. Additionally, they noted that they need more time to test the spacecraft and its instruments, as well as prepare and deliver the rover to Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  The rover is expected to launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, which is now scheduled for launch sometime in 2022. After arriving at the Red Planet, the rover will collect samples of Martian soil and rock for return to Earth for further study.  The mission is part of NASA and ESA's ExoMars program, which is designed to explore the Red Planet and search for evidence of past and present life. While the mission has been delayed, NASA and ESA remain committed to exploring Mars and look forward to the exciting discoveries the mission will bring.  NASA has announced that the launch of the Mars 2020 rover, which was scheduled to launch this year, will be delayed until 2022 due to the global coronavirus pandemic and its effects on the space agency. The Mars 2020 mission had been slated for July 17 of this year.  The mission is now expected to launch in late summer or early fall of 2022, a shift that will delay the rover's arrival on Mars by approximately two years.  NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is responsible for leading the mission, stated that the delay was necessary in order to ensure that the mission could be completed safely and successfully. The delay will also give the agency extra time to ensure that the rover is equipped with the latest technology and data to effectively complete its mission.  This delay will likely cause a ripple effect of other delays in the Mars exploration program. Most notably, the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, which had been set to follow in 2022, will now have to wait until 2024 to launch.   NASA has also stated that, despite the delay, the mission's objectives and goals remain the same – to search for evidence of past microbial life. The rover will also collect rock and soil samples that can be brought back to Earth by future missions.   Despite the delays, NASA remains optimistic about their exploration of the red planet, with plans for more missions in the future.']",

We all make decisions in our daily lives, but sometimes we are so focused on the end result that we forget to take ownership of those decisions.

Decisions such as whether to attend college, purchase a house, or begin a career are ones that should be carefully thought out and considered.

Furthermore, even if they are able to get the financial capital they need to start their businesses, they are still likely to lack the necessary networks, mentorship and support traditionally offered to their male counterparts. This makes it more difficult for them to navigate the often complex business environment and limits the success of their startups.  The lack of access to capital can be partially addressed with the help of government initiatives, such as microfinance, grants, subsidies and other forms of financial assistance specifically meant for female entrepreneurs. This can help bridge the gender gap in access to financial capital, which is a critical piece of the puzzle in building successful businesses. Furthermore, female entrepreneurs can benefit from the support of mentors, networks and other resources from the business community.  Overall, African female entrepreneurs are held back primarily by the lack of access to capital, and the gender-based social norms that give them less access to capital than their male counterparts. However, with the right measures, such as government initiatives and access to mentorship and networks, female entrepreneurs can still make tremendous progress and have a major impact on the continent.']",

We are actively participating in the Afghan peace process, in close consultation with the Afghan people and their government.  A successful peace process would end the conflict between the Afghan government and the Taliban and create conditions for long-term stability in the country. It would bring an end to the suffering of the Afghan people and create a better future for them and their children. It does not mean peace overnight, but it could pave the way for a more secure and peaceful Afghanistan and a more stable security environment in the region.  NATO is committed to supporting an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, including the full participation of women at all stages and the respect of international humanitarian obligations and human rights. We are providing advice and support to the Afghan government and people to ensure that any agreement is consistent with the Afghan Constitution and the principles of democracy, human rights, and rule of law.  NATO will remain in Afghanistan in a non-combat role supporting the Afghan government and people in the fields of security sector reform, institution building, and counter-terrorism as long as there is a need and our Allies and partners agree.

669,If the Taliban regain power,"[', they could impose rules, laws and restrictions similar to the ones they imposed when they were in power in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. These rules would likely include a strict interpretation and enforcement of Sharia law, a ban on music, television and many other forms of entertainment, restrictions on women's rights and freedom of movement, compulsory Islamic education, and a ban on non-Islamic religious practices. The Taliban would also likely impose a strict adherence to their own interpretation of Islamic dress and behavior. in Afghanistan, it could have many disastrous effects. It could severely limit the rights of women in the country and reinstate their oppressive laws. It could also bring a resurgence of terrorist activity and destabilize the region. It could also push Afghanistan back to a place of war, famine and poverty. Additionally, it could lead to international condemnations and sanctions. The international community would likely also act to contain the spread of any extremist views by the Taliban., they could implement a system of government like the one they had before 2001. This system would likely involve the implementation of a very strict interpretation of Islamic law and the harsh enforcement of restrictions on women's rights, religious minorities, and freedom of speech. The Taliban would also likely establish a totalitarian rule, where the government can control all aspects of the lives of ordinary citizens and clamp down harshly on any dissent or opposition. This could include activities like public executions and severe punishments for anyone who does not comply with the Taliban's rules.']",
670,Biden victories leave Sanders speechless,"['The Biden victories in the Super Tuesday primary races left Bernie Sanders speechless. After the results became clear on Tuesday night, Sanders reportedly said nothing, appearing stunned at the massive victories of his rival. Joe Biden had amassed a total of 9 out of 14 states, giving him an insurmountable lead over Bernie Sanders. It was a dramatic shift from the previous week's Nevada caucuses, where Sanders had held a decisive edge. In his speech Tuesday night, Biden proclaimed that he was now the clear Democratic frontrunner and that it was time for the party to unite behind him.  Bernie Sanders was apparently left speechless after Joe Biden’s victories in the southern Super Tuesday states.  According to a report from the Associated Press, Sanders was “silent and visibly emotional” after taking in the news of Biden’s victories in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.  Sanders, who is still in the race, was joined by his wife, Jane, and campaign staff at his hotel in Burlington, Vermont. He reportedly refused to comment to the Associated Press.  However, sources close to the campaign told the outlet that he was “shell-shocked” by the results, which come after Biden’s sweeping victory in South Carolina on Saturday.  The Vermont senator had been the frontrunner heading into the voting, but has since been overtaken by the former Vice President. Sanders is expected to address the media about the results later on Tuesday.']",

672,Trump's speech won't erase his bumbling response on coronavirus,"['No, Donald Trump's speech will not erase his bumbling response to the coronavirus. The speech certainly has its merits, but it does not make up for the actions he has taken in the face of the pandemic. Trump's lack of decisive action in March and April, when the virus was beginning to spread in the United States, has been heavily criticized by public health experts, and his decisions to downplay the seriousness of the pandemic have been widely condemned. Any speech is unlikely to undo these events and the ways in which they have undermined public trust in the government's handling of the outbreak.   No, it won't. President Trump's speech might provide some temporary relief to the public, but it can't erase his initial response to the coronavirus crisis. Trump's initial response has hurt his reputation, and it is something he will have to work to repair. Only through continued efforts to protect the public and show that he is taking the virus seriously can he start to make up for his earlier mistakes.  No, President Donald Trump's speech will not erase his bumbling response to the coronavirus pandemic. Though President Trump may attempt to reframe the narrative with an address to the nation, the public will still remember his missteps and mixed messages over the past several months. Even if the speech is successful in rallying support for the White House’s pandemic response, it will not undo the damage caused by the administration’s perceived mishandling of the virus.']",
673,Why Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters,"['Bernie Sanders' campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination was largely based on his progressive agenda and promise of sweeping economic reforms, but he failed to strike a chord with black voters. This could be due to a variety of factors, from Sanders' lack of a clear plan to address the systemic racism that disproportionately affects African Americans, to the racialized attacks he faced from within the Democratic Party, to his failure to meaningfully engage with the African American community on the campaign trail. Additionally, Sanders' focus on economic issues, while important, may have left many black voters feeling as though he was not paying enough attention to other issues they care about–such as criminal justice reform and addressing police brutality. Lastly, Sanders’ socialist identity could have been a turn-off for some African Americans who, historically, have been more likely to support center-left policies and candidates.  Bernie Sanders struck out with black voters due to a lack of recognition and exploration of the experience of African Americans in the political discourse. Sanders was not able to effectively communicate his message to this key constituency and failed to connect his rhetoric with the issues and struggles of African Americans. Additionally, Sanders did not have the same level of name recognition and celebrity support as some of his competitors and failed to create a groundswell of grass-roots support among black voters. As a result, he was unable to make a meaningful impression in the black community and earn their trust and support.']",
674,Trump's coronavirus speech was a disaster,"['Donald Trump’s coronavirus speech on March 11th was widely panned for its lack of detail on any concrete steps the US government would take in the face of the pandemic. While he made several announcements about his administration’s response to the outbreak, Trump largely relied on broad strokes and false assurances that the situation would soon be in hand. Critics pointed out that he failed to offer any new plans or detailed solutions, while offering unrealistic promises that the problem would soon be resolved. Trump’s speech did little to inspire confidence in the public or to bring clarity to the government’s response.  President Donald Trump’s speech during the coronavirus pandemic was widely viewed as a disaster. In his speech, Trump downplayed the severity of the virus, promoted unproven and even dangerous treatments, and fired off inaccurate comments about the virus and the response. He also falsely claimed that the virus would soon go away, and that the impact of the pandemic had been overblown by the media and Democrats. These untruths undermined public confidence in the government’s response and put thousands of Americans at risk.  President Donald Trump's coronavirus speech was widely judged to be a disaster. He was criticized for not sounding a more serious tone about the severity of the pandemic, for not correctly conveying the science, and for using contradictory and misleading information. He was also faulted for not offering a clear plan for addressing the crisis, and for suggesting that the virus would simply go away on its own.']",
675,The huge divide between Biden and Sanders,"['The main difference between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders is their views on progressive policies and their approach to achieving goals. Biden is a more moderate Democrat and supports policies that build on the existing policy framework. He generally believes in incremental change, using existing policies and laws to improve upon the existing system. He is also more open to compromise and working with the other side than Sanders. Sanders is a more progressive Democrat who supports radical changes to the system. He supports a government-run single-payer health care system, and other progressive reforms to tax and welfare policy. He also tends to be more adversarial when it comes to working with the other side. on the issue of health care and student debt has made it difficult for the two candidates to find common ground. On health care, Biden has proposed expanding the Affordable Care Act and allowing Americans to purchase a public health insurance option, while Sanders has advocated for a single-payer health care system, otherwise known as ""Medicare for All."" Biden opposes Sanders' plan, arguing the change would be too expensive and disruptive. Biden has also supported a plan to make tuition at public universities free for families making less than $125,000 a year, while Sanders has called for all public colleges and universities to be tuition-free. Biden prefers a more incremental approach, believing that large, sweeping changes can be too disruptive to the economy. The two have also disagreed on the issue of student loan debt, with Biden calling for an increase in loan forgiveness, while Sanders has proposed canceling all student loan debt.  Ultimately, there is room for compromise between Biden and Sanders on health care and student debt. Biden is open to the idea of providing a public option, while Sanders is open to the idea of tweaking his Medicare for All plan to make it more palatable to more moderate Democrats. There could also be a compromise on student debt, such as increasing the amount of loan forgiveness and making public college tuition more affordable without completely eliminating all tuition. If Biden and Sanders can find common ground on these issues, they could work together to create policies that are beneficial to both.']",
676,What we're missing about age and the presidency,"['One of the most important aspects of the presidency that is often not discussed in relation to age is experience. Experience is a critical factor for success in any role, but especially for the president of the United States, who has the responsibility of managing one of the most complex and powerful nations in the world. While a candidate’s age can be an important factor in determining their qualifications, it is not the only factor. The ability to make informed decisions, work with diverse people, and understand the current political landscape are all essential components of the president’s job, and these qualities are best honed through experience and practice. Therefore, it is crucial to weigh the benefits of a long career in public service along with any concerns about age when evaluating potential presidential candidates.  One thing we’re missing about age and the presidency is that age isn’t necessarily a limitation, as there have been plenty of presidents who have served in their 70s and 80s. The only limitation is that the President must be at least 35 years old, according to the US Constitution. We’re also missing that age isn’t always a factor in how someone will fare as President. It’s more about their experience and how they tackle the challenges the job presents.']",
677,Coronavirus shows up Trump's compassion deficit,"['The coronavirus pandemic has brought to light President Donald Trump's lack of concern for the safety and security of Americans. Despite warnings from experts, Trump has downplayed the potential danger of the virus, consistently underestimated the number of cases, and failed to provide adequate resources to combat it. He has also used the pandemic as an opportunity to rally his political base, furthering division among citizens instead of unifying families and communities. Trump's refusal to acknowledge the impact of the virus has been made evident through his refusal to enact stronger measures, such as nationwide social distancing and long-term economic policies, which could help reduce the number of cases and alleviate the economic impact of the virus. Trump's lack of compassion and disregard for the wellbeing of the American people is a glaring example of his inability to lead.  The coronavirus pandemic has shed light on the lack of compassion that President Donald Trump has demonstrated throughout his tenure as president. Trump has often disregarded the safety and well-being of the American people, choosing instead to focus on his own political interests. Trump has failed to provide consistent and clear guidance on how to deal with the pandemic, instead blaming the media and the Chinese government for its spread. He has downplayed the severity of the virus, dismissing the reality of the crisis by comparing the mortality rate of the virus to that of the flu, and stating that it would soon ""vanish."" Trump has notedly not shown empathy for those who have died, not once publicly acknowledging their deaths, and despite his power and influence, has failed to take a more direct approach in providing relief to those who are struggling. This lack of compassion and empathy, especially during a crisis, is directly in contrast to the behavior of some of his predecessors, and is indicative of his poor leadership and decision making in the face of a global pandemic.']",

Before anything else, the priority in any situation must be helping those in need. Therefore, the first step in any scenario should be to address the welfare and safety of the people who are affected by or involved in the situation. This means providing aid, support, and resources to those in need, whether that is through direct assistance, emergency services, or fundraising efforts.  The first step to help people facing economic hardship due to the current economic crisis is to provide immediate assistance to those in need. This could include providing financial assistance, such as direct cash payments, access to resources for food, housing assistance, medical care, employment assistance, and assistance with basic needs such as clothing and transportation. Additional measures could include increasing existing government programs such as unemployment insurance, and expanding access to social safety net programs such as Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC. Governments may also want to consider instituting temporary freezes on rents, mortgages, and utilities to help citizens weather the crisis. Other measures designed to help people in the short-term could include reducing the amount of taxes owed for those in lower income brackets and offering incentives for those able to keep paying.']",
681,It would be a disaster for us to have to choose between Sanders and Trump,"['A choice between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders for President would be a disaster for the United States. Both candidates are very polarizing figures, and it is highly unlikely that either of them would be able to work constructively with the opposing party to pass legislation or to improve the country. In addition, both candidates have proposed controversial and potentially damaging policies that could have a serious negative impact on the economy, foreign relations, and more. It is best for the future of the country that we avoid such a divisive situation and instead focus on working together for the greater good.. Sanders and Trump are polar opposites on virtually every issue, from healthcare and taxation policy to attitudes on immigration and foreign policy. Sanders is a progressive who believes in the power of government to address social and economic inequalities, while Trump is a populist who favors traditional conservative and nationalist policies. While Sanders and Trump may share some common ground on certain issues such as trade, their overall positions are too different for a meaningful comparison to be made.  That would be a terrible situation to be in. Fortunately, the choice you'll have to make on Election Day is between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, not Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Biden is a mainstream Democrat with moderate policies and a long history of public service, while Trump has a long record of damaging policies, lies, and corrupt behavior.

He has had a few setbacks in his business career, including the failure of his Bloomberg Tradebook division in 2001, but overall he has always found success.  Michael Bloomberg is no stranger to failure. As the founder, CEO and Chairman of Bloomberg L.P., Bloomberg has experienced many successes and failures throughout his career.

However, Biden's decisive victory on Super Tuesday, winning 10 out of 14 states, has narrowed the race to a single-candidate contest with Biden as the clear front-runner. After Biden's success, Sanders has since suspended his campaign.   Super Tuesday showed Biden's broad support among different constituencies of the Democrat party.

685,Warren Buffett has the right answer to crony capitalism: women (opinion),"['Yes, I believe that empowering women is one way to combat crony capitalism, as Buffett’s own investments in female-led businesses demonstrate. Crony capitalism benefits a privileged few and works against the interests of everyone else. Women are often disproportionately affected by its ill effects, so it makes sense to empower them to create positive change. Specifically, women should be included in the decision-making and economic power structure, and they can work to ensure that resources are deployed in ways that benefit all stakeholders. Through their leadership and advocacy, women can challenge the status quo and fight against crony capitalism. In addition, supporting female entrepreneurs and providing resources and opportunities to develop skills, knowledge, and networks can help create a more equitable economy. By doing so, women can help create a more equitable world.  The answer to crony capitalism is not easy, and there is no simple solution. But one effective way to address it is to increase the number of women in top executive positions.   Having more women in business leadership roles could bring more transparency, accountability and competition to the corporate sector. For example, research by Harvard Business Review found that companies with higher numbers of women in leadership roles are more likely to be innovative and to have better financial returns.  Women also tend to bring a different set of values to the corporate environment, often with more focus on collaboration and stakeholder interests. This could help to reduce the tendency for decision making to be driven by self-interest and cronyism.  Buffett himself has been a strong advocate for women, both in business and in society. He has supported female entrepreneurs and the development of the pipeline of female talent, along with promoting equality and diversity in the corporate sector.   In addition, Buffett has strongly supported measures to improve transparency in corporate decision-making processes, such as through the use of board-vote disclosure statements, which could help reduce cronyism.  Finally, Buffett’s investment strategy focuses on long-term value creation, which also helps to reduce the potential for cronyism. By avoiding short-term gains, he encourages companies to focus on long-term strategic objectives and to take a more responsible approach to decision-making.  There is no easy answer to crony capitalism, but increasing the number of women in leadership positions and implementing greater transparency and accountability measures can be an effective way to reduce its prevalence. Buffett’s actions show he understands this, and with his support of women and his focus on long-term value creation, he is helping to pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable form of capitalism.']",

It is important to empathize with the struggles and challenges that coronavirus has caused for people around the globe. It is also important to talk about the preventative measures that can be taken to slow the spread of the virus, such as social distancing, and to emphasize the positive steps that people are taking to care for one another.

687,The trade war put the economy on its heels. The coronavirus will be much worse (opinion),"['in terms of its economic impact. The trade war was more of a nuisance when it comes to the economy because it mostly involved tariffs, regulations, and levies. However, the coronavirus is much more serious because it is a global health crisis, leading to widespread job losses, business shutdowns, disruption of global supply chains, and a sharp decline in consumer spending. As a result, financial markets have seen unprecedented volatility, and governments around the world have had to implement massive fiscal and monetary stimulus packages to keep their economies afloat. The economic impact of the coronavirus will likely be much more severe than the trade war, making it a much bigger economic challenge. as it has affected people in a more direct way than the trade war has. The trade war has been a battle of tariffs, but the virus has been an invisible enemy that has disrupted commerce, travel, and personal contact. It is also much harder to predict the long-term implications on the economy due to the virus, as the effects of the virus are still unfolding. In addition, the global nature of the pandemic has meant that many countries are affected at the same time, making any kind of recovery even more difficult. Therefore, the coronavirus is likely to have a much larger and more damaging effect on the global economy than the trade war has.']",

This unprecedented turnout tipped the scales and pushed Biden ahead in key states like Pennsylvania and Georgia.   Many credit the ground game of Texas Democrats, who mobilized a wide swath of the state’s diverse population: young people, people of color, people who care deeply about healthcare, immigration, education, and criminal justice reform. The message was also a powerful one: vote to protect the future of the state and the nation.  The Lone Star State has long been known for its conservative leanings, but Biden’s victory in Texas has shown that the state is ready for change.

698,Your favorite crime shows hinder this life-and-death cause,"['This is a difficult question to answer because it depends on the effect that crime shows have on the individual viewer. For some people, crime shows may inspire them to take action to make a difference in the lives of those affected by crime, while for others, crime shows may desensitize them to the tragic reality of crime. Therefore, the ultimate effect of crime shows on the life-and-death cause will depend on the viewer's reaction.  Crime shows often feature sensationalized depictions of serious crimes and those affected by them, which can cause viewers to have a distorted perception of crime and criminal justice and the individuals who are involved in them. This distorted perception can influence their beliefs about the criminal justice system, fueling a false narrative and hindering the cause of true justice.  Crime shows, by their very nature, tend to glamorize and sensationalize crime scenes and the criminal justice system, which can potentially distort people’s perception of the reality of criminal justice. As such, watching too much of these shows can lead people to have an overly optimistic view of a criminal’s chances of being exonerated or winning a case, even when the odds of them being released or exonerated are slim. Additionally, crime shows can also lead people to think that the criminal justice system is fairer than it actually is, and can give a false sense of security.

Research shows that girls face significant gaps in their understanding of financial literacy compared to their male peers. They are also less likely to receive guidance on how to manage their finances and more likely to receive incorrect information.

714,SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,"['While a third party could be a viable alternative to the current two-party system, the likelihood of this happening is very low. The American political system is designed to make it difficult for any third party to gain a foothold. The two main parties control much of the political power and fundraising resources, making it difficult for any third party to compete. Additionally, the way Congressional districts are drawn makes it more likely that the two major parties will hold onto their seats of power. Finally, many voters are hesitant to vote for third parties, feeling their vote would be wasted.  It's possible that a third party could create the conditions necessary to get us out of the current political impasse. A third party could work to bridge the divide between the two major parties by emphasizing common ground rather than focusing on differences. This could help create a more unified political landscape in which both sides feel they have an equal opportunity to put forward their issues and have them heard. Additionally, a third party could inspire change by introducing new ideas, policies, and strategies that could help break the current stalemate and help create a more cooperative environment.']",
715,Confronting the cult of partisan media,"['Confronting the cult of partisan media requires confronting the underlying institutional incentives of media producers. For instance, focusing on delivering sensational content, such as inflammatory headlines and cherry-picking of stories, can increase viewership and hence lead to higher earnings for these media outlets. Consequently, political issues are given a partisan spin, which can further polarize society.   To counter this, governments and media organizations need to take steps to restore public trust in accurate and impartial reporting. This can be done by introducing new regulations and policies to promote greater media scrutiny and accountability. Media organizations should also diversify their sources of information and be transparent about the sources of their stories. Additionally, media outlets should strive to be honest and unbiased in their reporting, and strive to provide a fair and balanced view of current events. Finally, public education campaigns can also help to inform people about the risks associated with biased reporting and to promote civil dialogue across political divides.  The cult of partisan media refers to the tendency for news outlets to become increasingly biased towards certain political ideologies. This trend has increasingly been seen in recent years, especially in the United States. In order to confront this trend, it is important to encourage news outlets to present unbiased news and to prioritize facts over opinion. Additionally, it is important to encourage citizens to seek out multiple sources of information and to view news with skepticism. Finally, education on media literacy and an increased focus on media ethics among journalists can help to ensure that media outlets remain nonpartisan.']",

The branding will only cause confusion and distrust among the public, who may think nothing more than that the outlet is in league with a foreign government. This will only lead to further confusion and misunderstanding of news media, rather than a clearer understanding. Moreover, branding news outlets in this manner could have a chilling effect on freedom of the press, as it could lead to self-censorship and a reluctance to report on stories deemed too sensitive or critical of the government.  Branding news outlets as foreign agents will not make them any more transparent. In fact, it may cause the opposite effect as it could create an environment of distrust and suspicion. News outlets are already under an immense amount of scrutiny and pressure to produce high-quality, unbiased, and accurate news.

729,Trump's 'I want nothing' defense doesn't hold water,"['Donald Trump’s defense that he “wanted nothing” from Ukraine in exchange for military aid is highly unlikely to hold up in court. The evidence of Trump's intent to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, in exchange for U.S. military assistance, is strong and growing by the day. Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president is being viewed as highly incriminating, with Trump explicitly asking for a “favor” in return for the aid.  This is compounded by the testimony of numerous current and former White House officials, who have revealed that they were aware of a quid pro quo arrangement related to the Ukraine aid. All of this has led to an impeachment inquiry into the President. Thus, Trump’s defense that he “wanted nothing” from Ukraine is highly unlikely to be successful in court.

If the Democrats manage to win a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2020 election, they could introduce articles of impeachment against the President.   However, it is important to note that even if the Democrats do manage to impeach President Trump, his removal from office would still require a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which is currently controlled by the Republican Party.  Impeachment of a president is a decision that is ultimately up to Congress, as it is within the power of the legislative branch to impeach the president. It requires a majority vote in the House of Representatives, followed by a two-thirds majority in the Senate.

Furthermore, Trump's suggestion to ""rescue"" Kavanaugh was not to address the alleged wrongdoing, but rather to reward the accused with a powerful job in the White House. It is highly inappropriate for Trump to suggest this, and it undermines the #MeToo movement and sends the wrong message to survivors of sexual assault.  Donald Trump's recent suggestion that the Senate should ""rescue"" Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from the ""anger and the unknown"" of the sexual assault allegations against him is completely ridiculous. Despite the thorough FBI investigation that followed the allegations, Kavanaugh remains under a cloud of suspicion and doubt due to the very serious accusations that were made against him. Trump's suggestion would do nothing to erase the impact of the allegations or to address the concerns of Kavanaugh's many critics.

744,Cracks emerge in Trump's wall of GOP support,"['Although President Donald Trump has remained popular with the Republican base, many Republican Senators and Representatives have distanced themselves from the President in light of recent controversies.

In recent weeks, several Republican lawmakers have spoken out against Trump, including Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Cory Gardner (R-CO).

This lack of action is a disgrace and it could have serious consequences for our planet and future generations.. Even though he has been president for four years, he has still not done anything to combat climate change. He has pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord, rolled back environmental regulations, and is currently trying to pass a new rule that would strip protections for wetlands, streams, and other waterways. Trump has even gone so far as to try to deregulate the production of methane, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases. This is completely unacceptable and shows a complete disregard for the future of our planet. Climate change is real and it is happening now. We must take action to protect the planet for future generations.. Climate change is causing extreme weather events and causing rising temperatures, sea levels, and ocean acidification. By not taking action to address the global climate emergency, President Trump is violating the human right to a safe and healthy environment, endangering the health and safety of millions of people around the world.']",
756,Simone Biles: I went from foster care to the Olympics,"['It has been quite a journey! From struggling in the foster care system to achieving one of the greatest accomplishments of my life—becoming an Olympic athlete. It’s hard to put into words the feeling of having earned four Olympic gold medals, but there is one thing that I know for sure—my story of resilience and determination is only just beginning. I want to use my platform to inspire others to follow their dreams, even when the odds are against them. No matter your past, you can accomplish great things when you are willing to put in the hard work and never give up.  That's an incredible accomplishment! I'm so proud of you for following your dreams and achieving such an amazing feat! You're an incredible inspiration to everyone. Congratulations!  When I was six years old, I was placed into foster care. I felt alienated, scared and alone. But I had a strong faith in God and an indomitable will that kept me going.  I persevered and soon became a star in the world of gymnastics. I trained hard, worked hard, and kept my eyes on the prize. Today, I’m the most decorated American gymnast of all time, with four Olympic gold medals, eleven world championship gold medals, and multiple other awards.  But more than just being an Olympic champion, I’m also a role model and an inspiration to others who come from similar backgrounds. To them, I say, never give up on yourself and always reach for the stars. Anything is possible if you believe in yourself and put in the work!']",
757,A dark matter hurricane is headed our way,"['There is no scientific evidence to support the idea of a ""dark matter hurricane"" headed towards Earth. Dark matter is an invisible form of matter that scientists believe makes up the majority of the universe's mass and is not known to interact with any other type of matter, including Earth. and the only way to stop it is with a black hole.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to use a black hole to stop a dark matter hurricane. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with any other type of matter, including light, so it would not be affected by a black hole's powerful gravitational force. The only way to stop a dark matter hurricane would be to use some form of energy or particle to disrupt the dark matter particles that make up the storm.  Dark matter hurricanes are a theoretical phenomenon in which a large mass of dark matter particles moves through space in a concentrated manner similar to a hurricane. There is no evidence that such an event is imminent.  At this time, there is no evidence that dark matter hurricanes exist. There is still much to be discovered about dark matter and its properties, so it is possible that dark matter hurricanes could exist in some form. However, it would be premature to suggest that a dark matter hurricane is headed our way.']",
758,An Incredibly Fast 'Dark Matter Hurricane' Is Blowing Past Earth Right Now,"['An incredibly fast-moving cloud of dark matter is flying by Earth right now. This mysterious hurricane of dark matter is thought to be traveling at a speed of almost 250 km/s, or 560,000 mph. This marks the first time a cloud of dark matter has ever been observed moving this speed, providing further evidence that dark matter exists.  Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter believed to make up around 85 percent of the matter in the universe. Scientists are still unsure about the composition and behavior of dark matter, but the hope is that observations like this one could help to answer some of the most elusive questions about the universe.  The cloud of dark matter, nicknamed 'The Dark Matter Hurricane', was first discovered in 2019 when an international team of scientists used the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) Very Large Telescope to observe it. ESO’s data allowed the scientists to map out the motion and speed of the cloud, making it the first time dark matter has ever been observed moving at such speeds.  The researchers believe the cloud is likely composed of small particles of dark matter, which could help to answer some of the long-standing questions about the mysterious matter.  Although the cloud is flying by Earth right now, it poses no risk to us here on the ground. Dark matter is invisible, so while it may be close, it’s impossible to see or detect from Earth. Plus, since the hurricane is composed of particles, it’s unable to interact with regular matter.  The research team plans to continue observing the cloud of dark matter as it passes by our planet in an effort to learn more about its makeup and behavior, hopefully providing new insight into the mysterious matter that is believed to make up most of the universe.']",

Cohen had previously pleaded guilty to eight felonies, including two for campaign finance violations for the payments. Cohen said Trump knew the payments were wrong, and that he had acted with the purpose of influencing the election.  Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, admitted in federal court to violating campaign finance laws at the direction of Trump in the form of hush payments to two women who allegedly had affairs with Trump. Cohen revealed that he was reimbursed by Trump for the hush payments and that they were intended to influence the 2016 presidential election. In court papers, US prosecutors have accused President Trump of directing Cohen to make the payments in order to keep the women quiet in the weeks before the 2016 election.  In testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's longtime personal lawyer and fixer, provided evidence that the president directed him to commit a crime by arranging payments to two women who alleged they had affairs with Trump.   Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations related to the payments. He testified to Congress Wednesday that Trump personally directed him to coordinate the payments shortly before the 2016 election.   Cohen provided a series of emails, text messages and other documents to back up his claim, including a check for $35,000 that he said was signed by Trump himself in 2017 to reimburse him for the payments. He also said that Trump was aware of the payments and was in communication with him about them at the time.  Cohen also said that Trump had him lie to Melania, his wife, about the payments, and that Trump had also asked him to lie to Congress about his involvement in an effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.   The testimony raised new questions about the president's involvement in the hush money scheme, and could put him in legal jeopardy.  The House of Representatives is now investigating the matter.']",

In addition, the team should also consider how to create effective communication pathways and alert systems to ensure that the information collected is shared and acted upon in a timely manner. Finally, the research should focus on ways to mitigate potential biases and errors that could arise from models and algorithms that are built on incomplete or inaccurate data. answer  The term ""technocratic government"" refers to a form of rule in which decisions are made based on considered and informed technical knowledge, rather than on the basis of ideological principles or any type of traditional political order. In a sense, it is a form of leadership which is designed to put knowledge and expertise first, rather than the opinions or interests of certain influential individuals or groups.  Technocratic governments usually rely on the expertise of specialists in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and economics to inform policy decisions. This often involves using evidence-based decision-making to develop plans for action, and using data-driven analysis to inform the formulation of policy.  An important feature of a technocratic government is the separation of power from politics. This means that decisions are not made on the basis of political considerations, such as the interests of a particular party or group, but rather on the basis of expert technical knowledge and analysis. This can lead to a more efficient and better-informed decision-making process, as the people in charge are specialists in the field, rather than politicians who may be more interested in advancing their own personal agendas.  One of the major advantages of a technocratic government is that it can lead to more efficient policy implementation. With decisions being made on the basis of expert knowledge, there is less chance of mistakes or costly missteps due to a lack of understanding of the issues at hand. Another advantage is that it can help to ensure that policies are based on the best available evidence, rather than relying on the personal opinions or preconceived notions of politicians.  Despite these advantages, technocratic governments also have some drawbacks. For example, the reliance on experts can lead to a form of elitism, as the opinions of ordinary citizens may be overlooked in the decision-making process. Additionally, the lack of a political element can mean that it is difficult to hold technocratic governments accountable for mistakes or missteps. Finally, technocratic governments can be vulnerable to abuse, as powerful individuals or groups may be able to use their expertise to gain control of a government and pursue their own interests.  Overall, technocratic governments can be seen as a way of ensuring that decisions are based on expert knowledge and evidence-based analysis, rather than politics and ideology. However, it is important to bear in mind the potential drawbacks']",
778,Barack Obama: America will take the giant leap to Mars,"['As part of my Administration’s commitment to space exploration, I’m proud to announce that America will take the giant leap to Mars. We’re aiming to send humans to orbit Mars by the 2030s and return them safely to Earth, and to one day remain on the Red Planet for an extended time. To get there, we’ll need to develop new technologies, strengthen international cooperation, and increase public-private partnerships. Through these efforts, the next generation of explorers will no longer be bound by the imagined restrictions of today. Instead, they will be able to explore distant worlds and forge a new frontier in the history of human progress.  Building on the progress we have made to explore our solar system, I am proud to announce that America will take the giant leap to Mars — and become the first nation to place boots on the red planet. We’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history.   Our journey to Mars will be a difficult one. It will require our scientists and engineers to push the boundaries of innovation, and our astronauts to take risks that have never been attempted before. But I have complete confidence in our team of explorers. We have the talent, experience, and vision to make this journey a reality.  Together, we will write the next great chapter of American exploration. With a vision and a plan, we will continue the spirit of discovery that defined the beginning of the space age and take the next giant leap for mankind.']",

While Zika virus is spread by mosquitos, HIV is spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, and other blood-to-blood contact. Additionally, the two diseases cause very different symptoms and complications. Therefore, it is unlikely that Zika virus could become as widespread and as dangerous as HIV.  No, Zika is not likely to be the next HIV. Zika is a virus that is primarily spread by mosquitoes, while HIV is a virus that is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids. In addition, the symptoms and treatments of Zika and HIV are very different, and the ways that each virus affect the body are also dissimilar in many ways.  No, Zika is not likely to become the next HIV. The Zika virus has a different transmission route (mosquitoes, versus sexual contact for HIV) and is not known to be capable of long-term infection. In addition, there have been a number of successful efforts to control Zika outbreaks, such as the use of insecticides, while current treatments for HIV remain limited.

It can be perpetrated by people who adopt extremist ideologies and have access to weapons, as well as people who have mental health issues and access to weapons. Homegrown extremism is a serious threat to America as these people can carry out acts of violence and terrorism without needing foreign support or knowledge. This makes homegrown extremism particularly difficult to stop as it can be difficult to identify potential perpetrators before they act. In recent years, there have been numerous attacks in the U.S. that were perpetrated by individuals with extremist ideologies or mental health issues. This trend points to the need for increased vigilance and security measures to combat this threat. white supremacists and violent extremists, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI reports that domestic terrorists have committed more acts of violence on American soil than international terror groups since 2013. The majority of these acts of violence come from white supremacist and other extreme right-wing groups, such as the alt-right and neo-Nazis. One study found that 81 percent of extremist-related homicides were committed by far-right extremists between the years 2009 and 2018.

787,David Axelrod: A surprise request from Justice Scalia,"['Justice Antonin Scalia made a rare request to lawyers involved in a case before the Supreme Court. He asked that they discuss a wide range of legal issues beyond those presented in the case.   This request was a surprise because Justice Scalia was known to be a proponent of narrow interpretations of the law and usually opposed such expansive arguments. His request in this case suggested he was open to considering broader implications of the case.   The request was a surprise in part because it was unexpected and in part because it ran counter to Justice Scalia's usual stance. Nevertheless, it offered the lawyers an unusual opportunity to explore legal issues outside of the narrow scope of the case itself.  Justice Scalia's surprise request is unknown at this time.  The recently-passed Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was known as a conservative, staunchly originalist jurist who often presented sharply-worded opinions, and often found himself at odds with colleagues of different ideologies. Though he is no longer with us, it is possible that someone could make a surprise request from the late Justice Scalia, to hear his insights on a certain matter, or to seek his opinion on a certain case or legal matter.

788,Donald Trump's Super Tuesday amnesia on race,"['Donald Trump has been criticized for largely avoiding any discussion about race during his two Super Tuesday victories. Despite being in the thick of the campaign trail and speaking to large crowds of Americans, Trump has yet to address the issues of racism, police brutality, and mass incarceration. He also hasn't spoken out against hate crimes committed by his supporters or used his platform to promote reconciliation between minority communities and law enforcement. Instead, he has often made blanket statements about the need for ""law and order"" and ""greater respect for our police."" These comments have been largely seen as pandering to voters, rather than actually acknowledging and addressing the injustices faced by people of color in the United States. It's also concerning that Trump has failed to take a stand against white supremacists who are known to support him, or to address the racism that has been pervasive throughout his campaign. By avoiding these issues, Trump is perpetuating the idea that race is not an important factor in American politics and that it should be ignored.  Donald Trump’s Super Tuesday triumphs have left many pundits asking how a man with a history of controversial statements about minority groups — from Latinos to African Americans — can be so popular with Republican voters. While Trump was quick to tout his victories Tuesday night, he was notably quiet about the role of race in the outcome.  Trump has previously drawn criticism for his comments about Mexican immigrants, for example, when he said many of them were ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" He has also made incendiary remarks about African Americans, arguing that many of them live in poverty and crime-ridden cities, and claiming that some of them are ""lazy.""  It appears that Trump has adopted a strategy of amnesia when it comes to race. He has failed to address or even acknowledge the role of race in his campaign thus far, and has instead focused on his promises to make America 'great again' and to address the issues of jobs and national security.  Whether this strategy will hold up in the long term remains to be seen. While Trump’s message of economic populism may be palatable to many, his positions on racial issues could be a major liability in the general election if he becomes the GOP nominee.']",

As such, it is far too early to tell if the First Amendment is “safe” from any potential policy changes proposed by President Donald Trump.  At this point, it is difficult to predict what Donald Trump's stance on the First Amendment will be. He has repeatedly made statements that could potentially be interpreted as threats to free speech, but he has not taken any direct action against the First Amendment yet. It is important for people to remain vigilant and active in protecting their First Amendment rights.

794,Generation X: Americaâs neglected âmiddle childâ,"['Generation X is often referred to as the “middle child” of America’s generations. This is due to the fact that Gen Xers, now aged 35 to 50, are sandwiched between Baby Boomers, the largest generation, and Millennials, the fast-growing new generation. Gen Xers have the unique challenge of living with the expectations of the Baby Boomers, a generation that prizes hard work and often traditional values, while also keeping up with the ever-changing technological advances and cultural shifts brought on by Millennials.  Gen Xers have often been overshadowed in the media and in cultural discussions. They lack the nostalgic romanticism of the Baby Boomers and the freshness of Millennials, making it almost too easy to simply ignore them. This lack of attention has led to the label of the “neglected middle child” of generations.  Thankfully, recent efforts to recognize Gen Xers have become increasingly common. In particular, Gen Xers are starting to be seen as a valuable asset in the workplace. They are creative thinkers, well-trained in technology and familiar enough with the traditional values of their Baby Boomer counterparts to bring a unique set of skills to the table.  As our culture continues to rely on technology more and more, Gen Xers are uniquely equipped to bridge the gap between Baby Boomers and Millennials. They understand both sides of the generational divide, and are often working in positions of power or influence at major companies and organizations.   Gen Xers also bring a unique skillset to the table as parents. As the parents of Millennials, they are often able to use their knowledge of technology to better guide their children through the digital world. Gen Xers are also quick to embrace the different values of their own generation and the generations that follow them. This makes them valuable bridge-builders between the generations.  The neglected “middle child” of generations deserves more attention and recognition. Gen Xers are a valuable asset in the workplace, and their unique perspective can help bridge the generational divide. With more recognition and appreciation of Gen Xers, our culture will continue to benefit from their skills.']",

Social Apathy: Boomers are also known for their lack of concern for the social issues that affect younger generations, such as climate change, poverty, and social inequality. They have done little to stem the tide of these issues, instead providing lip service and empty promises for solutions.   3. Political Polarization: Boomers are arguably the most politically divided generation in history, and their stubbornness to budge on their respective issues has resulted in gridlock on Capitol Hill. This has resulted in the inability to reach a consensus on anything, from healthcare to immigration.  4. Cultural Misappropriation: Boomers have been accused of cultural misappropriation, often taking and “owning” ideas and practices of marginalized groups and then trying to pass them off as their own. This has caused significant cultural harm as well as long-term damage to knowledge of and respect for cultural diversity.   5. Selfishness: Boomers have been labeled as self-centered and selfish, often to the detriment of other generations.

799,Generation X Is Sick of Your Bullshit,"['',  'It Happened One Night',  'The Grapes of Wrath'  Generation X has had enough of the hypocrisy, elitism and blatant disrespect that has been displayed by people, organizations and businesses. We’re tired of being talked down to and spoken over. We’re sick of having our ideas and hard work dismissed out of hand. We’re fed up with being expected to conform to someone else’s way of doing things. And we’re done with having to please everyone else before considering our own needs.

801,My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"['Justice Antonin Scalia was a unique and often polarizing figure in the American judicial system. He was known for his strict interpretation of the law and his often acerbic and combative public comments. He was a passionate advocate for his judicial philosophy, often arguing with his colleagues on the Supreme Court about the correct interpretation of the law.  Although I disagreed with many of Scalia's views and rulings, I found his commitment to the law and his intellectual rigor to be admirable. His willingness to debate ideas and engage in passionate arguments, even if we disagreed, was a testament to his commitment to the law and our system of justice.  I believe that Justice Scalia's open-mindedness, his willingness to thoroughly discuss and debate the law, and his commitment to the Constitution were some of his best qualities. While I may not have always agreed with his opinions, I respected and admired his ability to argue his points effectively and concisely.  Justice Antonin Scalia and I disagree on the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, I support the modern liberal interpretation of the Constitution while he favored the more originalist and textualist approach.  Justice Scalia's approach looks at the plain language of the text and tries to limit interpretations to what it says. He interpreted the Constitution as static document that employs a static set of rules. He considered the original intent of the framers to be paramount, and he dismissed legal principles such as stare decisis, which looks to precedent, as unimportant.  I, on the other hand, believe that the Constitution can be interpreted more liberally. This approach uses the text of the Constitution to keep it relevant to the modern times. This interpretation uses precedent and rational interpretation to expand the application of the document. With the liberal interpretation, the Constitution is thought of as a living document that adapts with the changing times.  While Justice Scalia and I had a fundamental disagreement about our approach to the Constitution, we were both passionate about protecting the civil liberties of the people. We both respected the Bill of Rights and its importance to protecting the freedoms of all people. We both held a deep respect for the rule of law and the legal system as a whole.  Ultimately, I believe that Justice Scalia and I were able to communicate our beliefs and understand each other's opposing views. We may have disagreed, but we both agreed that the Constitution was a document that should be respected and followed.']",

805,Is it ethical to colonize Mars? (Opinion),"['Whether it is ethical to colonize Mars is a complex issue that depends on a variety of personal and societal values. Some would argue that it is our ethical responsibility to explore new frontiers and establish new settlements, while others would argue that the resources used to colonize Mars would be better spent addressing issues on Earth. Ultimately, the decision to colonize Mars is a personal one that must be informed by a thoughtful consideration of its ethical implications.  It depends on the specific circumstances of the colonization. In general, it would be unethical to colonize Mars without considering the potential impact on the planet's environment and any existing forms of life on its surface. Similarly, any potential human inhabitants should be considered and treated ethically, respecting their rights and interests.  No, it is not ethical to colonize Mars. While colonizing another planet may seem like a good way to take the pressure off of our overcrowded planet, it does not address the root causes of overpopulation. We should instead focus on finding solutions to our environmental and social problems, such as reducing energy and resource consumption and improving access to healthcare, education, and other services.  This is a difficult question to answer and opinions on the matter may vary greatly. From a moral and ethical perspective, one could make a case that it is not ethical to colonize Mars without having fully evaluated the potential impacts on its environment and its native inhabitants (if any). On the other hand, one could also argue that it is ethically acceptable to colonize Mars if done in a responsible and sustainable manner, and with respect for the planet and its resources. Ultimately, this is a complex issue and it is up to each individual to decide what they believe is the most ethically justifiable position.']",
806,How 'Back to the Future' blew it,"['When it was released in 1985, Back to the Future was an instant hit and continues to be one of the most beloved films of all time. But, like all movies, it has its flaws.   First, Marty's time travel hijinks are seen by most to be scientifically implausible. From a plot perspective, it is never explained why the flux capacitor in the DeLorean needs to reach 88 mph in order to start time travel. Additionally, the time travel seems to be inconsistent, with both Doc Brown and Marty experiencing time-slips as they travel when they shouldn't.  Next, the film's handling of certain themes can also be called into question. Regrettably, a few of the jokes seem to be dated and offensive today, including Dr. Emmett Brown's quote about nuclear test sites. Additionally, there are a few sequences of the movie that are often seen as excessively violent, including the scene where Marty is chased by the Libyans.  Finally, some of the plot elements are totally implausible, too. For example, there is the scene where Marty visits the past and introduces rock music to his parents' generation, something that would not have been possible given the styles of music that were popular in the 1950s.   Despite these flaws, Back to the Future remains a beloved classic, and it's easy to see why. The movie is filled with charm and humor, and it still delivers an entertaining and nostalgic ride.']",
807,I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"['1. Don't judge others: Having been judged so much as a child, I can understand how easy it is to form judgments of others- and how hurtful those judgments can be. Instead, I strive to take the time to get to know someone before judging them.  2. Allow your children to be themselves: I don't try to mold my children into what I think they should be, but rather, I try to create an environment that supports and encourages them to be who they are.  3. Lead by example: My own experiences taught me that children learn by example, so I strive to model the kind of behavior I want my children to display.  4. Embrace differences: Even though I didn't have a lot of friends when I was a kid, I was able to embrace the differences in others and that helped me to build stronger relationships as an adult. I encourage my children to do the same.  5. Support: Kids who feel supported and accepted are more likely to succeed. I strive to provide my children with the support, encouragement, and love they need to feel confident in themselves and make positive decisions.  1. Be Kind: Bullying is a major issue in schools, and unfortunately it’s something most kids will face at some point in their life. Growing up, I was certainly one of the kids who others targeted. But I learned early on that kindness is the best response to those who act out of cruelty. I’m passing this lesson on to my kids and encouraging them to be kind to others, even when it’s difficult or uncomfortable.  2. Don’t Take It Personally: Being unpopular in school can be hard, but it’s important to remember that it often does not reflect on your worth as a person. I was reminded of this with my own kids when they had moments where they felt excluded or judged by their peers. We can’t control how others treat us, but we can control our own response.  3. Celebrate Your Uniqueness: I was never the popular kid, but that doesn’t mean I couldn’t find my place in the world. Once I started to focus on my own unique strengths, I was able to make friends and find my niche. I encourage my kids to do the same and to celebrate the things that make them unique.  4. It’s OK To Reach Out For Help: It’s hard to feel like an outsider, but it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. It’s OK to reach out for help if you need it. I’ve been honest with my kids about my own experiences growing up and letting them know it’s OK to ask for help if they ever need it.']",
808,Biden on 'Colbert' -- shockingly frank and noble,"['During his recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Vice President Biden gave a surprisingly frank and noble assessment of his time in office. He opened up about the frustration of not being able to do more, his concerns about the upcoming presidential election, and his admiration for the young people in this country fighting for social change. Biden was also candid about his own shortcomings, admitting fault for not pushing hard enough on the healthcare bill and other initiatives. His words were inspiring and grounded in the need to work together to build a better future.  When former Vice President Joe Biden appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in August 2020, he was both shockingly frank and noble.  In his interview, Biden discussed a range of issues from racial justice to the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He spoke candidly about the dismay he feels over the president’s lack of empathy and understanding. He discussed the need for police reform and even offered a plan for achieving it. However, he also talked about the importance of acknowledging the work that countless officers have done to protect their communities.  Biden also discussed the need for systemic racism to be addressed in order to ensure true equality and justice. And he spoke about the need for empathy, both when confronting racism and in regards to the ongoing pandemic. He called on Americans to use their power and resources to help those most in need during the crisis, rather than turning inward.  Overall, Biden’s appearance on the show was a refreshing display of honesty and compassion. He spoke candidly about the issues of the day and did so with a sense of empathy and understanding.

He also encourages people to support research into the causes and prevention of miscarriage. Finally, Zuckerberg encourages people to remember that it's okay to be sad and to take the time to grieve.']",
810,How outrage over Cecil killing misses the point,"['Outrage over the killing of Cecil the lion by a foreign trophy hunter has brought much-needed public attention to animal conservation issues. However, the outrage may be misplaced. Despite Cecil's celebrity status, focusing too much attention on one single animal may ignore the larger issues at play.  There are millions of animals in the wild facing more immediate threats than hunting. The threat of habitat loss due to human encroachment, climate change, and pollution is far more widespread and destructive than hunting. This means that the death of Cecil is a symptom of a much larger problem that requires more than just outrage to solve.  What is needed is broader and more effective steps to protect wildlife and their habitats. This could include improved regulations, better enforcement of existing protections, and increased funding for conservation. Moreover, the discussion needs to move beyond hunting and trophy hunters to encompass a broader array of issues, such as habitat destruction and poaching.  Cecil's death was an unfortunate tragedy, but his death should not be the focus of the conversation. The outrage over Cecil should be productive in a way that leads to long-term solutions, rather than just an isolated incident. If it can do this, then it will be a positive step in the right direction.']",

It is a huge honor and privilege to serve in this position, and many people are eager to put their name in the running.  There are so many people running for president in 2020 because the presidential election is an important opportunity for citizens to express their voice and shape the future of the United States. The current president, Donald Trump, has been a very controversial figure, so many people are eager to challenge him for the presidential nomination. Additionally, the wide range of candidates running for president reflects how complex and diverse the American public is, with a variety of viewpoints and opinions at stake in this election.']",

To do this, a comprehensive approach that includes diplomatic, financial, and humanitarian assistance, is required.   The United Nations should lead the diplomatic effort for peace in Syria. UN diplomats should focus on finding a political resolution to the conflict. This should involve engaging with all of the relevant stakeholders, including the Syrian government, armed groups, and regional powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran.   The international community should also provide financial and material assistance to the most affected areas. This could include assistance for medical care, access to food and water, and reconstruction of homes and infrastructure.   Finally, the international community should provide humanitarian assistance to those who have been displaced by the conflict. This should include providing access to services such as education and healthcare, as well as assistance for those who need to resettle in other countries.

814,Why can't America have high-speed trains?,"['America has the potential to have high-speed trains, but there are many barriers preventing it from becoming a reality. These factors include cost, lack of existing infrastructure, geographic challenges, and political opposition. High-speed trains are expensive to build and require extensive maintenance and operation costs. In addition, the US has fewer existing rail corridors that could be upgraded to host high-speed trains, as compared to other countries that have more densely-populated land. Finally, many politicians have been reluctant to invest in high-speed rail projects due to political considerations such as the perceived cost of the projects or opposition from those who prefer other transportation modes.  America has started to invest in high-speed rail projects, but so far progress has been slow due to a combination of factors. These include a lack of political will, a lack of funding, the need to acquire land and rights-of-way, environmental issues, and long lead times required to plan and build large infrastructure projects. Additionally, the vast size of America and the relatively low population density makes high-speed rail more challenging in comparison to smaller countries like Japan and France where the system has been more successful.  There are a few reasons why America does not have high-speed trains. One of the major obstacles is the lack of funding. The United States does not have the same levels of investment for rail infrastructure as many other countries do. Additionally, there are physical limitations to retrofitting existing train tracks for high-speed use. Finally, the geographic spread of the US makes high-speed trains less feasible compared to a more compact European country.']",
815,The marriage apocalypse may be coming (Opinion),"['The marriage apocalypse may be upon us. As the number of unmarried adults continues to increase, so too does the number of divorces. According to research conducted by the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, the divorce rate in the United States is at a 40-year peak, with the number of divorces taking place doubling in the past twenty years.  At the same time, marriage is becoming less desirable as a whole. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2018, only four out of ten Americans believe marriage is necessary to have a successful relationship. These trends make it seem like the institution of marriage is on the brink of an apocalypse.  The reason for this marriage apocalypse is multi-faceted. For one, the number of people deciding to get married is decreasing. In 2017, approximately 59 percent of adults 25-34 were married, compared to 72 percent in 1978. This could be attributed to a variety of factors such as economic insecurity or a lack of faith in marriage as an institution.  The cultural landscape is changing as well. More and more people are turning to different forms of commitment, such as living together and raising children together without the formality of marriage. This could be due to the stigma associated with divorce, and the many potential adversities that come with it.  The traditional notion of marriage is also becoming outdated. In today’s society, it is acceptable to commit to a partnership without marriage. This is especially true for people who are not legally able to marry, such as same-sex couples.  It is unclear what the future of marriage will look like, but it seems inevitable that it will be drastically different from how it has been historically. The marriage apocalypse may very well be upon us.']",
816,Without God,"[', life is meaningless  Without God, life has no purpose and no direction. Life can be filled with joys and sorrows, but it can also be filled with an emptiness and a lack of meaning. God gives purpose and hope to life. He offers us a relationship and a way to live life to its fullest potential. Without Him, life can feel meaningless and empty.  Without God, many people feel a sense of loss or lack of purpose in life. Some may struggle to identify with a moral code or code of ethics and feel disconnected from the larger spiritual community. Without God, some may feel as though their lives lack significance, while others may find comfort in the freedom to live without rules or expectations. Some may struggle with feelings of guilt or regret because they have no religious outlet to turn to for absolution or peace. Others may find a new connection and appreciation for the complexities and beauty of life, feeling inspired by their newfound autonomy.,” Rothko was reported to have said, “I am nothing.” For Rothko, God and spirituality were key components of his creative process and his work, often serving as a source of guidance and inspiration. Rothko believed in the power of art to serve as a spiritual force, believing that it should be used to evoke emotion and create moments of reflection and introspection. He used the canvas to explore the complexities of life and the human condition, while at the same time hoping to convey a sense of divinity and a universal message of hope and understanding.']",
817,Nudity doesn't shock us anymore,"['Nudity has become more commonplace in many different forms of media and entertainment, so it is no longer seen as necessarily shocking. Rather than being seen as a taboo subject, many people now view nudity as a form of expression or art. Although some people may still be uncomfortable with seeing nudity in certain situations, it is no longer seen as something that is universally unacceptable.  The shock factor of nudity has reduced significantly in the last several decades due to its ubiquity and the availability of nudity online. People have become desensitized to it and with the rise of social media, it has become so commonplace that it no longer has the power to shock people like it once did.  Nudity, in some contexts, has become commonplace in today's society. What used to be considered scandalous is now commonplace in movies, television shows, fashion magazines, and other forms of media. As a result, nudity no longer shocks us as much as it once did.  That may be true for some people, but for many others nudity still shocks, offends, and causes discomfort. It is important to remember that everyone has different cultural values and history, and some people may take offense to nudity even if the majority of the population does not.']",
818,Why more women choose not to marry,"['There are many reasons why more women are choosing not to marry. Some of these reasons include wanting to pursue career and educational goals without the constraints of traditional gender roles, the increased availability of alternative sources of companionship and intimacy, and the prevalence of divorce and changing gender norms. Additionally, the changing financial landscape has allowed women to become more financially independent, which may lead to a preference for remaining single. Additionally, many women are choosing to focus on their personal journeys, rather than dedicating their time and energy to a marriage.  There are many reasons why women choose not to get married. Some may have had a bad experience in the past, or have seen relationships around them fail, and this has led them to be more cautious or skeptical about traditional marriage models. Others may find that the idea of being legally bound to someone for the rest of their life is too restrictive, or overwhelming. Some women feel that their career and social networks are more important to them than a marriage, and don’t see the point in getting married. They could also recognize the freedom that comes with being single, and have no desire to give that up. Financial independence is also a huge factor that can permit women to stand on their own two feet and stay away from marriage if desired. Ultimately, it’s a personal decision that should not be judged by anyone else.']",

Although CBD is generally considered safe, research on its use in children is very limited at this time.  The legal status of CBD oils differs depending on location, so it is important to research the appropriate regulations. It is advised to speak with a qualified medical professional prior to giving any form of CBD product to a child.  CBD oils are not recommended for use in children due to the lack of regulation and research on the safety and effectiveness of the product for this population. As such, it is recommended that parents consult their pediatrician before considering a CBD product for their child.  No, unless prescribed by a doctor. CBD oil is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and research on its safety and effectiveness in children is limited. Therefore, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before using CBD oil in children.  No, I do not use CBD oils for my child. CBD is not recommended for children due to concerns around possible side effects and interactions with other medicines.']",
821,Why Does My Kid Prefer My Partner?,"['It is natural for children to feel more connected to one parent over the other, and this can be especially true if your child has lived away from one of you for an extended period of time. Your child may also feel more comfortable with your partner due to their familiarity, or if your partner is more nurturing or patient. It could also be because your partner is more invested in playtime and hobbies that your child enjoys, or simply because your child is drawn to the different dynamics of your different relationships. Ultimately, your child may just resonate more with your partner for unknown reasons, and it is important to respect your child’s feelings and to understand that this preference can change over time.  It is normal for children to develop a closer bond with one parent over the other. This could be due to many factors, including the parent providing more attention, access, or rewards. It is also possible that your child feels more comfortable expressing their feelings to one parent more than the other. It is important to recognize that children need and deserve attention from both parents and talking with your partner about how to ensure your child is getting the attention and affection from each of you is likely beneficial.']",

823,Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House as Wall Street Suffers Rout,"['Congress is nearing a deal with the White House to pass a massive stimulus package in order to combat the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin continued late into Wednesday evening, and the two sides have reportedly made progress on key sticking points. The deal could come as soon as Thursday morning, although there is no guarantee of a deal being made.  On Wall Street, stocks suffered a brutal selloff Wednesday as fears of a potential new wave of coronavirus-related restrictions weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1,861 points, its worst one-day point drop since March. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also posted steep losses.  The proposed stimulus package includes direct payments to Americans, unemployment benefits, and help for small businesses. It is expected to be the largest economic rescue package since the Great Recession over a decade ago. If a deal is reached, it must still pass through both houses of Congress and be signed by President Donald Trump in order to become law.  Congressional leaders and the White House are nearing a deal on a massive economic stimulus package to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, amid a stock market rout caused by investors' fears of the virus' impact on the U.S. economy.  The tentative agreement, which is expected to be completed on Tuesday, would include billions of dollars in direct payments to individuals, loans to small businesses, extended unemployment benefits, and aid to beleaguered industries such as airlines, hotels, and other travel-related businesses.  The deal comes after days of negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and top White House economic advisors, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who have been trying to craft a deal that would pass both chambers of Congress and be signed by President Donald Trump.  The package is expected to include direct cash payments to most individuals and households, as well as $250 billion in loans to small businesses. The direct payments would be based on income, potentially including up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. The size of the payments would be reduced for those who make more than $75,000 a year and eliminated for those earning more than $99,000.  Additionally, the bill could also include an additional $250 billion in extended unemployment benefits, as well as billions of dollars in aid to states and cities impacted by the virus. The bill is also expected to include some form of aid to the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic.  The agreement comes as Wall Street has been roiled by fears of the economic impact of the virus, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 1,000 points on Monday. Analysts have warned that the virus could push the U.S. economy into recession and have called for urgent action from Washington to stave off a prolonged economic slump.']",
824,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['In the wake of a nationwide wave of protests following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, President Donald Trump is struggling to unify a nation that has never been so divided and on edge.  Since Floyd’s death, mass demonstrations have taken place in cities across the country, calling for a reckoning on why black Americans are disproportionately affected by police brutality and death. Trump, who was criticized for his response to the events in Ferguson, MO, in 2014, has been visibly absent from the national dialogue, rarely addressing the issue of police brutality and largely avoiding the subject in his public statements.  When the protests first began, Trump issued a brief statement on Twitter, insisting that “law and order must be restored.” But as the demonstrations have continued, his public appearances and comments have done little to address the underlying issues or attempt to heal a fractured nation. Instead, the President has seemed more preoccupied with sending a clear message to protesters - that any violent unrest will be met with overwhelming force from the military and local police.  He has also refused to condemn white supremacist groups, instead repeating his campaign mantra of “law and order” and encouraging local law enforcement to take a hard-line stance on protesters.  Without a clear strategy to address the systemic racism that has led to Floyd’s death, Trump’s attempts to unify the nation have largely fallen short. In a nation where people of color make up the majority of the population, Trump’s handling of Floyd’s death and the protests that ensued has only widened the racial divides that already exist in the United States.  Trump’s lack of a unified message on the issue has left him appearing as an impotent bystander, unwilling or unable to lead or shepherd the nation through these turbulent times. His refusal to offer strong words of unity and healing has further strained the political divides that have characterized his time in office, leaving many to wonder how the nation will ever be brought together.']",
825,Louisiana Postpones April Primary as 4 More States Prepare to Vote on Tuesday,"['Louisiana will delay its April 4 primary election, becoming the fifth state to do so as the U.S. continues to grapple with the novel coronavirus pandemic.  The state had already extended early voting out of an abundance of caution and urged voters to take advantage of its broadened mail-in ballot system.  The delay comes just days before four other states -- Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio -- are set to head to the polls on Tuesday.  Louisiana officials said the decision to delay the primary was taken in response to new restrictions put in place by Governor John Bel Edwards to help contain the spread of the virus.  The decision came just hours after Donald Trump extended federal social distancing guidelines through April 30.  The state's election date has now been pushed back to July 11, with early voting resuming on June 29.  The delay is being met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a necessary step to protect the public, while others expressing concerns about the potential for disenfranchisement and voter suppression.  Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said the state was ""committed to ensuring that all Louisianans have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote, even in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis.""']",
826,Afraid of Coronavirus? That Might Say Something About Your Politics,"['It appears that people's political leanings can have an effect on how they feel and think about the coronavirus. Those who lean more to the left tend to be more worried and concerned about the virus, while those who lean right tend to be less worried. This could be due to a variety of factors, including the fact that those on the right may downplay the severity of the virus due to its potential economic and political impacts, while those on the left may be more concerned about public health risks and the need for social distancing and other preventative measures. Ultimately, it appears that one's political perspectives can have a large influence on how they view the coronavirus.  The fear of the Coronavirus is certainly a logical and rational one and one that can affect everyone regardless of their political beliefs. However, studies have shown that how people view the virus and how they act to protect themselves from it may be strongly linked to their political beliefs.  In a survey conducted by Politico/Morning Consult and published in May of this year, it was found that Republicans and Independents are less likely than Democrats to take safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Over 70% of Democratic respondents reported that they always wear a face mask when they are outside their home, compared to 59% of Republicans and 43% of Independents. Democrats were also more likely to report that they have canceled trips and social events and that they have been social distancing.  This survey suggests that how fearful a person is about the Coronavirus may be related to their political views. Democrats appear to be more likely to be concerned about the virus and take safety precautions, whereas Republicans and Independents are less likely to do so. This may be due to differences in how conservatives and liberals view the virus in general, including how serious of a threat it is and how much the government should intervene in the response.']",
827,Joe Bidenâs Young Voter Problem: They Donât Think Heâs Listening,"['Joe Biden is an experienced politician and is well-respected by many, but he has had some struggles when it comes to the younger voting demographic. This is mainly because many young voters don't believe that he is listening to their concerns, or that he is actively addressing them. Biden has made some attempts to reach out to younger voters, such as introducing plans to make college more affordable and embracing progressive stances on issues like student loan debt and the Black Lives Matter movement. However, he needs to do more to demonstrate his commitment to listening to and addressing issues of importance to younger voters. He should create a platform that allows young people to interact with him more directly, and to provide him with more direct feedback on the policies and issues he is pushing for. Additionally, Biden should continue to speak up about issues that are important to these younger voters, such as climate change, student loan debt, and youth activism. It is essential for Biden to prove to these voters that he is willing to listen to their perspective and to make changes that reflect their needs and desires.  Joe Biden's young voter problem is one of the biggest issues his campaign team is facing. His ability to secure the votes of young people is seen as key to his victory in the 2020 election. Biden's campaign has been struggling to reach the youngest voters, with many feeling he's not listening to the issues they care about. This disconnect is causing a lot of people to stay home on election day or to cast off their votes to third party candidates.  To address this issue, Biden's team needs to find a way to connect with young voters. He should focus on issues that are important to them, such as climate change, student loan debt, and access to healthcare. Biden should make sure young people know he is listening and that he is willing to take action on the issues they care about. He also needs to reach out to young people directly, by attending rallies and utilizing social media.  Ultimately, Biden's team needs to make sure young people know their votes will be heard and that their voices will be considered in the decision-making process. By doing so, Biden can demonstrate that he is listening and that he is serious about addressing the issues that matter to young people. Joe Biden has the chance to win over young voters and make sure he is elected president in November.']",
828,American Astronomyâs Future Goes on Trial in Washington,"['The future of American astronomy is currently being put to the test in Washington D.C. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently considering a proposal for a new $4 billion observatory to be located in the desert of Chile.   The proposed observatory, dubbed the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), would be the most powerful observatory ever built, with a light gathering capacity that would dwarf the capabilities of telescopes currently in operation. It would allow astronomers to map the entire night sky, from the deepest corners of the universe down to our own backyard—and beyond.  The NSF will decide whether or not to approve the project based on its merits, which include the potential to increase our understanding of dark energy and dark matter, the search for Earth-like planets outside our solar system, and the ability to detect asteroids that could potentially impact Earth.   Arguments in favor of the project include its potential as an engine of economic growth, and the fact that it would create a long-term legacy of scientific exploration and discovery. Proponents of the project also point to a study funded by the NSF that found that the economic benefits of the LSST could potentially outweigh the cost of the project.  On the other hand, some critics argue that the money for the LSST could be better spent on more pressing needs, such as medical research, poverty alleviation, or other STEM initiatives. Others worry that the project could be delayed by unforeseen technical difficulties and/or cost overruns.  The LSST is currently undergoing a rigorous evaluation process. So far, the project has received both strong support and skepticism from scientists, politicians, and the public. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not the project gets the green light will fall to the NSF, who must weigh the potential scientific and economic benefits of the LSST against its cost.']",
829,Trump Administration Moves to Speed Coronavirus Testing,"['The Trump administration is moving to speed up coronavirus testing to combat the spread of the virus. They plan to make testing faster and more widely available. This includes expanding emergency use authorization for home-testing kits, sending testing machines directly to nursing homes and other high-risk populations, and working with commercial labs to increase testing capacity. The administration is also making efforts to locate and secure enough testing supplies, like swabs and chemical reagents. Additionally, the administration is working towards several public-private partnerships to coordinate research and make testing more available in areas that are experiencing a surge in cases.   In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump Administration has announced a series of measures designed to speed up testing and reduce the backlog of coronavirus tests.  The first step announced by the Administration is a partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and five major commercial laboratories, including LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics, and CVS Health. These five labs will be given access to the CDC's diagnostic test kits and will be able to rapidly produce and distribute the COVID-19 test results to clinicians and hospitals.  The second step announced by the Administration is a pilot program, called ""Check, Test and Protect,"" which will allow the CDC to coordinate with states to set up sites for free testing. The sites will be located throughout the US and will be funded by federal and private sources.  Finally, the Administration is working with the private sector to expand the number of tests available to the public. The goal is to make tests more easily accessible and affordable for all Americans.  All of these measures are a vital step in providing more rapid and accurate testing for the coronavirus, which will help to reduce the spread of the virus and save lives.']",
830,China Spins Tale That the U.S. Army Started the Coronavirus Epidemic,"['China has not claimed that the U.S. Army started the coronavirus epidemic. Although some Chinese state media outlets have suggested that the U.S. Army was possibly involved in the outbreak, those reports have not been backed up with any evidence.  In March 2020, the Chinese Foreign Ministry posted a tweet that suggested the “U.S. military brought the epidemic to Wuhan”. The tweet was widely criticized for suggesting that the U.S. Army was somehow involved in the initial outbreak without providing any evidence.  In April 2020, Chinese state-run media outlets, including the Global Times and the People’s Daily, ran several stories suggesting that the U.S. Army may have brought the virus to Wuhan. However, these claims have been debunked by the World Health Organization and independent researchers, who have yet to find any evidence to support this theory.  China has not officially accused the U.S. of being responsible for the coronavirus epidemic, and therefore cannot be said to be “spinning a tale” that the U.S. Army was involved.  China has denied any involvement with the Covid-19 pandemic and has instead spun a tale that the U.S. Army started the epidemic.  The Chinese government claims the outbreak began in a U.S. military lab in Maryland, citing an anonymous tip sent to a Chinese state-run media outlet in February. The Chinese government has since made unsubstantiated claims that the virus was created as a bioweapon by the U.S. Army and then released in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.  The U.S. has denied such accusations, and experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) have said there is strong evidence that the virus originated in a wild animal market in Wuhan and was then spread by human contact.  The attempt by China to blame the U.S. Army for the outbreak is a calculated attempt by the Chinese government to deflect from its own mismanagement of the outbreak. By focusing on the U.S. military instead of its own actions, the Chinese government is hoping to salvage its international reputation.']",
831,Trump Falsely Tries to Tie Obama to C.D.C.âs âInadequateâ Testing System,"['In a false effort to tie former President Barack Obama to the current issues surrounding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) “inadequate” testing system, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that Obama was responsible for the system's shortcomings.  Although the CDC has faced criticism and been accused of inadequate testing, Trump’s attempt to blame Obama is unfounded. The Obama Administration began preparing for a potential pandemic by increasing the federal government’s strategic stockpiles of medical supplies and establishing an emergency operations center at the White House in 2009.  In addition, the Obama Administration worked to equip the CDC with the necessary resources and authority to respond to outbreaks. This included providing states with additional funding for public health programs and establishing a task force to better coordinate pandemic preparedness.  Trump’s claims are not only false, but also distract from the current administration’s mishandling of the pandemic. Trump has failed to acknowledge the CDC’s warnings about the virus and has dismissed its recommendations for social distancing. Furthermore, Trump has downplayed the virus, further hindering the nation's response to the pandemic.  In comments made during a press conference, President Donald Trump falsely attempted to tie Barack Obama to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) ""inadequate"" testing system for the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said that the system was ""set up by the Obama administration"" and that it was ""so inadequate that we had to basically stat hammering it out,"" adding that the government was ""trying to correct it as we speak.""  However, Trump's comments are false. The CDC's testing system for the coronavirus pandemic was not set up by the Obama administration; the system was established in the Trump administration in early January of 2020. Furthermore, the CDC's testing system has been continually updated and improved upon by the Trump administration in the months since the pandemic started.']",
832,On Politics: âA Major Warâ,"['Between U.S. And China Is Unlikely  The potential for a major war between the United States and China is unlikely, according to several military and foreign policy experts.  Although the two countries have clashed economically and politically in recent years, with tensions rising over Taiwan, the South China Sea and more, both nations are well aware that any major military conflict between them would be catastrophic. There is also the concern that any military action could spiral out of control, leading to a conflict on a massive scale.  Instead, experts suggest that the two countries will likely continue to engage in low-level skirmishes and proxy wars, with the risk of a limited, large-scale conflict never completely vanishing. Without a doubt, both sides will be looking to preserve the peace, if possible, and seek ways to manage the rising tensions. Between China and the U.S. Is Unlikely  While there is certainly a great deal of tension between the United States and China, particularly in terms of trade policy, a major war between the two countries is highly unlikely. The political, economic, and military costs of such a conflict would be tremendous and the risk of it escalating into a nuclear exchange would be too great for either side to accept. Both countries rely heavily on each other in terms of trade and global influence, and while they will likely continue to come into conflict, a major war is improbable.']",

At Airports  Travelers coming from coronavirus hot spots have reported that they did not face any screenings at airports. After the coronavirus outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued travel advisories to discourage US citizens from traveling to certain countries that have a high risk of infections. Despite the warnings, many travelers have been allowed to board flights and make their way back into the United States without any quarantine or screenings at airports. This has raised concerns about the risk of further spreading the virus, which has already spread to more than 150 countries. In response to these concerns, the CDC has ramped up screenings for travelers from certain areas, as well as increasing its travel advisories.']",

836,Pentagon Asks to Reconsider Awarding Huge Cloud Contract to Amazon,"['The Pentagon has asked for a re-examination of a decision to award a $10 billion cloud contract to Amazon, a move that could open the door for other technology companies to compete for the prized contract. The contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program, is intended to create a cloud computing environment for the military, and Amazon is widely seen as the favorite for the contract.   The Pentagon's request for a re-examination is not a surprise. Microsoft has challenged the contract award process in court, alleging that Amazon had an unfair advantage, while Oracle and IBM have also objected. The request comes after the Government Accountability Office released a report in March criticizing the Pentagon's handling of the JEDI award.  The re-examination could potentially result in other technology companies being allowed to bid on the contract. If the Pentagon determines that the bidding process was flawed, it could choose to re-open the competition. This could give other tech companies the chance to vie for the contract, and it could mean that Amazon wouldn't automatically be handed the JEDI contract.  However, it is unclear how long the re-examination process will take, and it might not result in any changes. Amazon remains the favorite for the contract due to its vast experience with cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and the company has already been building a team to work on the project.  Regardless of the outcome, the process of re-examining the award is likely to take some time. In the meantime, it is an open question whether other companies will be given the chance to compete for the JEDI contract.']",

As the pandemic has advanced, government and health officials have warned that even the most influential individuals are not immune to the effects of the virus.  This risk was highlighted when Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive for the virus and was admitted to the hospital. Johnson is currently recovering in his home with the support of his medical team.   Other world leaders have seen their staff test positive for the virus. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, tested positive for the virus in late March. US President Donald Trump was among those who expressed his solidarity with the German leader.  The chief of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also revealed that some of his staff had tested positive for the virus. As a result, Ghebreyesus has taken extra precautions, including wearing a face mask at all times, and having his temperature checked regularly.  The risk of infection for world leaders is heightened due to their often busy and unpredictable schedules, meaning they are routinely exposed to a wide array of people, some of who may be infected. Thus, even the highest-level officials are not exempt from taking precautionary measures and adhering to the recommendations of their health officials.   World leaders who have tested positive embody just a fraction of the larger pandemic story. While the number of cases is concerning, it is essential to remember that the virus can be stopped if the right protective measures are taken. Governments are advising social distancing, frequent handwashing, and face masks to help contain the virus, and it is the responsibility of both world leaders and citizens to try and protect one another.']",
859,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['According to experts, the worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths range from 200,000 to 500,000. This estimate is dependent on the actions taken by individuals and the government to control and mitigate the spread of the virus. For example, if the majority of citizens adhere to government-mandated social distancing and the use of masks, the death toll could remain at the lower end of the estimate. However, if people fail to follow these safety measures, the death toll could be much higher.  The worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths vary depending on who is offering the estimate and when. For example, in April 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force estimated that the U.S. could see between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths from the pandemic. The CDC has also focused on a higher range of deaths, projecting that up to 200,000 people could die from the virus in the U.S. by June 1. Other estimates have been even higher. For example, one epidemiologist estimated that up to 2 million people in the U.S. could die from the virus by the end of the year.  The worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths range widely, depending on the size of the eventual outbreak, and the effectiveness of response measures taken by the government and the American public. Some of the estimates put forward by medical experts range as high as 2 million deaths in the U.S. by the end of 2020, although most estimates are much lower than that. More likely estimates hover around 200,000 deaths by the end of the year if measures such as social distancing are successful, although the number could be higher if the outbreak is not effectively contained.']",
860,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['The worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths range from between 500,000 to 1.7 million, depending on the intervention measures taken by federal, state and local authorities. The estimates come from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The IHME estimates that the death toll could range from about 138,000 to 601,000 if most U.S. states practice social distancing and other measures to contain the virus. Without any social distancing measures, however, the IHME estimates the death toll could reach between 501,000 to 1.7 million.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that between 160,000 and 214,000 Americans will die from COVID-19 by August 22, 2020. This estimate is based on the current trends and projections of the pandemic. This estimate does not take into account any additional mitigation efforts that may be implemented in response to the rising numbers of cases. There is also the possibility that the course of the pandemic could take a more severe turn which would result in a much higher number of deaths.  The worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths vary depending on the sources used. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an organization associated with the University of Washington, the current worst-case scenario is 308,000 deaths by November 1, 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicted a range of between 160,000 to 214,000 deaths in the United States by August 22, 2020.']",
861,Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System,"['Intensifies  The pressure on New York City to close its school system is intensifying as coronavirus cases surge across the city. City and state officials are weighing the risks of keeping students and staff in school buildings against the disruption and hardship caused by closing them during the pandemic.  In the last week, more than 3,000 new coronavirus cases have been reported in the city, surpassing the previous week’s record of 2,700 new cases. With the positivity rate now at 3 percent, schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said this week that the city is “close to a point where we may need to consider rolling back some of the reopening of our public schools”.  Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that the city is not yet close to that point, but on Wednesday he outlined new numbers that could trigger a closure. He said that if the city's weekly Covid positivity rate stays above 3 percent for seven consecutive days, he will close the schools, but he said the city's priority remains keeping schools open.  Meanwhile, the city's teachers union has called on the city to close schools in all parts of the city, while others have urged the mayor and chancellor to focus on closing “cluster schools” in areas with high infection rates and leave open those in neighborhoods with lower rates.  The decision to close or keep open New York City schools will have a major impact on the city's 1.1 million public school children and their families. It will also affect teachers and other school staff, who are among those at the highest risk of contracting the virus.']",

Every person is different when it comes to their risk and vulnerability. Make sure to consult with your health care provider and stay informed about the proper precautions to take.']",
867,Opinion | The Pandemic vs. The President,"['In 2020, the pandemic is trumping the President. As the Covid-19 continues to ravage the United States, infecting more than 11 million people and killing over 250,000 people since its onset, the President has been largely absent from the public discourse, instead choosing to focus on issues such as baseless accusations about the election, rallies for his supporters, and most recently his Covid-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization.   The pandemic has fully overwhelmed and disrupted the lives of many Americans, and yet the President has done little to reduce the severity of its impact or reassure a weary public. Instead, he has downplayed the virus, spread false information about it, and as of late has even neglected to provide consistent guidance on proper health and safety measures.   In the past, the President has had a profound impact on public opinion and the behavior of the American people. However, the pandemic has drastically upended that influence and has instead taken center stage in the minds and lives of many citizens. The pandemic has become the force that is steering the country and will undoubtedly be the defining feature of the 2020 political landscape, regardless of who takes the oval office come January.']",

869,Meet the New Drive-Through: A Coronavirus Clinic Serving Up Swabs,"['The novel coronavirus has caused a need for new and innovative ways to provide medical services. One of the latest methods is a drive-through coronavirus clinic. This drive-through clinic provides testing and diagnosis for patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Instead of having to wait in line, or even enter a building, the patient is able to get tested for the virus from the comfort and safety of their own vehicle.  The drive-through clinic offers a variety of services and testing including swab testing, blood tests, and antibody tests. The swab tests are used to detect the virus, while blood and antibody tests can indicate whether or not a person has had the virus in the past. Once a patient is at the drive-through clinic, a trained healthcare professional will administer the tests needed and provide the results after a few days. Results are typically available within 48 hours.  This new drive-through coronavirus clinic is providing much-needed services to people without having to put their health and safety at risk. It is a great example of how technology can be used to help people get the medical care they need during a pandemic.  The new drive-through clinic is part of a unique and innovative response to the coronavirus pandemic. Located in Grandview, Missouri, the clinic is the first of its kind, offering drive-through swabbing services. People who want to be tested can simply drive up to the clinic, then a trained medical staff member will take a nasal swab sample. The sample is then sent to a lab for testing and the results are sent back electronically to the patient.  The clinic is headed by Bradley Dean, MD, who has 16 years of experience in the medical field and was recently named the COO of Grandview Health Systems' Coronavirus Response Team. The clinic has seen over 200 patients since it opened in mid-April, and is a critical part of helping to curb the spread of the virus.  The clinic is open to anyone who wants to be tested, with no appointment necessary. Drive-through testing also enables patients to have their tests done in a safe, convenient, and time-saving manner. The clinic also prioritizes testing for those who are symptomatic or have been exposed, as well as those in high risk groups.  The drive-through clinic is a great example of how innovative technology and quality healthcare can be combined to provide a novel approach to our current coronavirus pandemic. By allowing individuals to get tested quickly and conveniently, the clinic will help spur a faster reaction to potential outbreaks and help our city move forward and get back to life.']",
870,Efforts to Control Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme,"['The United States is already taking unprecedented steps to contain the spread of the coronavirus, imposing quarantines, closing schools, banning large gatherings, and urging people to practice social distancing. However, it is likely that the measures to control the virus could get even more extreme.   Governments around the world have implemented drastic restrictions including travel bans, curfews, and lockdowns. In the U.S., these measures could become more widespread if the rate of infection continues to rise.   Closing the country’s borders completely is one of the most extreme measures under consideration. Many countries have already taken this step, but it would be logistically difficult and unprecedented in the U.S. The government could also implement travel restrictions such as requiring travelers to obtain special permission to move between states.   In addition, cities and states may impose more strict quarantine and isolation regulations. This could mean that people are required to stay home at all times and limit their contact with others. In some cases, people may even be required to wear face masks in public.   Finally, the government could step in and take control of private businesses in order to coordinate the distribution of resources and reduce the economic impact of the crisis. This could include nationalizing businesses, setting price controls, or suspending contracts.   These measures may seem excessive, but they are necessary for ensuring the safety and well-being of the public. We may yet see even more extreme steps implemented as the situation unfolds.']",
871,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['In the last few weeks, the United States has seen some of the most unpredictable and chaotic events in recent memory. At the center of it all is the President of the United States, Donald Trump. His ability to provide the leadership necessary to bring the nation together in a time of crisis is something that has come into question.  In the wake of four consecutive days of protests in response to the death of George Floyd, President Trump has made numerous attempts to address the nation. The President has advocated for law and order and called for the immediate deployment of the National Guard in certain states in order to limit the scope of the protests. He has also used Twitter to express his disappointment in the destruction of property.  At the same time, he has also made efforts to address inequality in the United States. He has called for the end of racial profiling, as well as support for the Black Lives Matter movement and peaceful protests.  It is difficult to deny that the President’s statements have not been without controversy. At a time when the nation is divided and on edge, many feel that the President’s words and actions have only added to the tension. His tweets have been met with criticism from both sides of the political aisle.  The President's actions over the past few weeks have been viewed by some as too little and by others as too much. He has been criticized for not condemning the protesters when they went too far, as well as for not forcefully speaking out against the excessive use of force by law enforcement.  At a time when the nation needs strong leadership, President Trump has struggled to provide the unifying voice that is necessary to bring the country together. Rather than bridging the gap between different demographics, the President is accused of polarizing the nation further.  It is clear that the President has been unable to successfully use his platform to provide a unifying voice for the country. In a time of national crisis, it is the responsibility of the leader of the nation to set the tone and demonstrate an ability to bring the nation together. Without this, the nation is likely to remain divided.']",
872,From Rocky Season to No Season,"['From one season to another, the change in weather can often bring significant changes to the way animals behave. Many animals, such as birds, migrate to different environments that offer the necessary resources for their survival during the colder months. Other animals, like mammals, hibernate to conserve energy and depend on stored fat until warm temperatures return. Plants and trees also respond to changing seasons, with some species dropping their leaves, while others flower and produce fruit. All of these changes, from Rocky Season to No Season, demonstrate the incredible adaptation and resilience of the natural world.  Rocky season typically refers to the dry season in areas with tropical climates. During this time of year, the air is generally dry and the skies are clear. This season typically lasts from late May to late October and is characterized by hot, dry weather. During this season, vegetation tends to be sparse and the landscape is often dry and arid.  No season is the complete opposite of rocky season and refers to periods of time when the weather is more consistent and predictable. During no season, precipitation is more likely, with rain being the most common type of rainfall. The temperatures are usually more mild and moderate, with none of the extreme fluctuations that accompany the rocky season. During this season, vegetation and plant life is generally more abundant and lush, and the landscape usually looks greener and less parched.']",

875,Itâs Not the Music. Itâs Not the Lyrics. Itâs the Drama.,"['The drama of music and lyrics is often overlooked, but it plays an important role in how the audience connects to the song. It's the dramatic arc of the narrative that captures the attention of the listener and drives the emotion of the song. A powerful chorus can evoke an emotional response, for example, or a repeated phrase can build anticipation as the song progresses. The drama added by the arrangement of different instrumentation, tempo, and dynamics can also make a huge impact on how the audience interprets the song. In essence, the drama of music and lyrics is what makes the song stand out from the rest and helps it become memorable to the listener.  The drama of a song is the emotion and feeling it conveys. The lyrics and music should work together to evoke meaningful emotions in the listener. The artist has to make sure that their message is being communicated clearly, whether it’s love, anger, sadness, joy, or any other feeling. The drama of a song comes from the combination of the lyrics, music, and performance. It's about how the artist conveys their message and how the listener interprets it.

879,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['1) Increase the number of dedicated Covid-19 testing sites across the country: Currently, the US has more than 1,400 testing sites. However, many of these are concentrated in the most populous states, such as California and New York. To increase access to testing, the federal government should partner with states, local governments and private organizations to expand the number of testing sites in less densely populated areas. This would ensure that individuals in rural areas and other underserved populations have access to testing.  2) Improve investment in resources for testing: The federal government should allocate additional funding for testing resources, including more equipment and personnel. This investment would help ensure sufficient testing capacity across the United States, particularly in underserved and rural communities.  3) Increase access to Covid-19 testing: All states should make Covid-19 testing more easily accessible by expanding how individuals can access tests, including through online or toll-free telephone numbers. By making it easier to access testing, individuals can get tested sooner and take the necessary steps to protect themselves and others.  4) Create an online platform for test results: To reduce the burden of waiting for test results, the federal government should set up an online platform where individuals can check their test results as soon as they are available. This would enable individuals to take the appropriate steps to protect themselves and others while they await their results.  5) Streamline the approval process for test kits: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should streamline its approval process for new Covid-19 test kits. This would help ensure that the new test kits are approved quickly and available for use in a timely manner.  6) Promote education about Covid-19 testing: Health organizations and the government should focus on educating the public on the importance of getting tested for Covid-19. This could include promoting free or discounted test kits, providing accurate and up-to-date information about testing guidelines, and emphasizing the importance of taking the necessary steps to protect oneself and others while awaiting test results.  7) Increase access to at-home testing: To make testing more convenient and accessible, the government should encourage the development and use of at-home testing kits.

880,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['1. Increase Testing Capacity: The first step in fixing the coronavirus testing mess is to increase the capacity for testing. This should include increasing the availability of testing centers, hiring more personnel to staff them, and purchasing and using more supplies and equipment.  2. Expand testing criteria: Many countries have limited testing criteria either due to lack of resources or limited understanding of the virus. Expanding testing criteria to include people who may have been exposed but do not have typical symptoms would help to identify and contain the virus.  3. Create Test Scheduling Apps: Creating apps that allow people to schedule coronavirus tests for themselves or loved ones and to view test results would help streamline the process and make it easier and faster for people to get tested and to access their results.  4. Improve Compliance of Quarantine and Isolation Laws: Many countries have laws in place to try and contain the virus but often lack enforcement. Improving compliance of quarantine and isolation laws could help to reduce the spread of the virus.  5. Enhance Communication and Education: Improving the communication around coronavirus testing and educating people on why it is important and how to get tested could reduce some of the confusion and anxiety.  6. Empower Local Governments: Local governments often have the best understanding of their communities’ needs and how to best meet them. Empowering local governments to make decisions about testing, quarantine, and isolation could help ensure that the most effective measures are taken.  7. Improve Testing Data Maintenance: Upgrading current systems of data maintenance would allow for better tracking of testing progress, better management of resources, and better contact tracing.']",

All over the world, governments have enacted lockdown measures to limit the spread of the virus, businesses have shut their doors, and public places have been deserted. But the situation could still get much worse before it gets better.   If the virus continues to spread in the coming weeks, it could overwhelm hospitals and health care systems, leading to even more deaths. At the same time, existing economic disruptions could deepen as businesses struggle to stay alive and layoffs increase, leading to even more financial insecurity and poverty.   The pandemic could also have longer-term impacts on society, such as permanent changes in how we interact, work, and travel. In some countries, the hard-won progress made in recent years toward democracy and human rights could be reversed, as authoritarian leaders take advantage of the chaos.   In the face of all this, it’s understandable to feel a sense of dread. But it’s important to remember that we still have a chance to shape our future. Effective measures such as social distancing and widespread testing can help contain the virus and prevent an even worse outcome.

884,Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus,"['Testing  The US government has failed to deliver on its promise to expand coronavirus testing. This failure has had disastrous consequences for the nation and its citizens, as the virus continues to spread unabated across the country.  The testing failure began early in the pandemic when the Trump administration failed to take decisive action to expand testing capacity. This allowed the virus to spread unchecked as cases soared. Eventually, the government was forced to allocate billions of dollars to expand testing capacity, but this effort has been woefully inadequate.  The testing efforts have also been hampered by widespread shortages of testing supplies and poor communication between the federal government and the states. The result has been delays in testing, long wait times, and a lack of transparency regarding the actual number of tests being conducted.  The US needs to drastically improve its coronavirus testing system if it is to effectively contain the virus. This means investing in additional testing supplies and increasing communication between the federal government and state health departments. The government also needs to be more transparent about test results and take action to ensure that everyone who needs a test can get one quickly.  The ongoing failure to address the coronavirus test capacity crisis is a sad indicator of the incompetence of the federal government’s response to this pandemic. It is time for the government to deliver on its promise to increase testing capacity so that it can save lives and help the nation get back on its feet.']",

The coronavirus pandemic should have been taken seriously from the very beginning. But instead, the president downplayed the severity of the outbreak and told his supporters that everything was “under control” and going “very well.” He even refused to wear a mask at times and attended large gatherings, sending a message that the virus was not a serious threat.  But it is. And the consequences of the president’s actions have been dire. Cases of COVID-19 have skyrocketed in the United States, with record numbers reported in many states. Hospitalizations are at an all-time high, while physicians and nurses are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients who need care. And sadly, thousands of people have died from the virus.  It’s a devastating scenario, made even worse by the fact that it was preventable.

886,Opinion | Letâs Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses,"['I believe that courts should move online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses so that the court system is not overwhelmed and the accused can be processed more quickly. This could help the court system process cases more quickly and efficiently, as well as save time and money for both the accused and for the government. Additionally, this could reduce overcrowding in jails and prisons, as well as reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. By eliminating or reducing bail for nonviolent offenses, it would also ensure that those who are accused of certain offenses are not punished simply because they do not have enough money to post bail. This would, in turn, help to reduce the likelihood of individuals committing additional crimes in order to be able to pay their bail.   Overall, moving the court system online and suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would help to speed up the process of justice, reduce the spread of disease among detainees, and reduce the risk of individuals returning to a life of crime.  I believe that the court system should move online and suspend bail for non-violent offenses. In this era of social distancing and virtual work, courts should make use of technology to continue to process cases. This would provide a safe and efficient way to keep cases moving while keeping people safe.  It would also be beneficial to suspend bail for non-violent offenses. Many prisoners are held in jails because they cannot afford to pay bail, which can take up to weeks or even months. This creates a financial burden on families, as they struggle to make the payments or wait in jail until the case is resolved. Suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would help ease the strain placed on already strained budgets and would ensure those accused of nonviolent crimes can remain free until their court date.  Finally, moving courts online and suspending bail for non-violent offenses could help reduce recidivism rates. Declining to set high bail for non-violent offenders and allowing them to remain at home, with access to work, family, and other support systems, could prove beneficial in the long-run and help ensure that those accused of non-violent crimes are more successful when they re-enter society after their case has been resolved.   Ultimately, transitioning courts to an online platform and suspending bail for non-violent offenses could lead to improved public safety, reduced recidivism, and a fairer justice system.']",

888,The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.âs Digital Henchman,"['The rise of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (M.B.S.) has been accompanied by a corresponding rise in digital authoritarianism. This is largely due to the savvy use of digital technology by M.B.S. and his supporters, including the use of a ""digital henchman"" to control online discourse and monitor dissidents on social media.  The digital henchman is essentially a network of trolls and bots that are programmed to spread pro-M.B.S. propaganda, disrupt conversations, and manipulate public opinion in the crown prince’s favor. These digital henchmen are often used to target critics of M.B.S.’s policies and smear them through online harassment and character assassination.  Unfortunately, the use of the digital henchman has come at a cost. The rise of digital authoritarianism has had a negative effect on civil liberties and freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the use of trolls and bots to manipulate public opinion has increased the mistrust and polarization of Saudi society.  As a result, M.B.S.’s digital henchman has proved to be counterproductive, and has been largely abandoned by the crown prince in recent months. M.B.S. has instead turned to more traditional methods of silencing his critics, such as imprisoning and harassing dissidents.  The rise and fall of M.B.S.’s digital henchman highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of modern authoritarianism. On one hand, digital technology can be used to control and manipulate public opinion in an attempt to consolidate power. On the other hand, the use of digital authoritarianism can be risky and is often met with backlash and even further alienation of the regime.']",

The days were long and exhausting. Each day, I had to arrive at the hospital before sunrise. I had to report to a specific wing of the hospital and wait to be directed to a specific patient. I was responsible for doing intake screenings, which included taking temperatures and asking relevant questions about contact and exposure to COVID-19.   I was constantly worried about keeping myself and my family safe. I knew that I had to be vigilant about handwashing, wearing a mask, and keeping my distance from potential carriers of the virus. It was a challenging time, and the fear that accompanied it was palpable.   I worked in the hospital for a few months until the situation stabilized, and while it was a hectic and overwhelming time, it was also a time of incredible courage and resilience. I worked alongside dedicated healthcare workers, who worked tirelessly to ensure that their patients were taken care of. I was so inspired by the strength and determination of these medical professionals, and by the willingness of the community to come together and support one another.   As the pandemic continues to impact our lives, I will never forget the courage and hope that I witnessed in the early days of the crisis.

890,Opinion | Theyâve Contained the Coronavirus. Hereâs How.,"['The coronavirus pandemic has been one of the most daunting public health crises of our time, but there is good news. Through a combination of public health measures, such as social distancing, contact tracing, mask-wearing, and targeted lockdowns, many countries have successfully contained the spread of the virus and brought the pandemic under control.  The key to success lies in the combination of multiple interventions that work together to reduce transmission. While social distancing has been widely adopted, contact tracing has been another key piece of the puzzle. By quickly identifying people who have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, contact tracing can help stop the spread of the virus by isolating infected individuals.  Mask wearing has been another important tool in containing the virus. While masks aren't a substitute for social distancing, they can reduce the spread of droplets that carry the virus and help to protect both the wearer and those around them.  Targeted lockdowns can also be helpful. By limiting activities and gatherings in specific areas, such as those with higher rates of transmission, it can help to slow the spread of the virus and buy time for hospitals to prepare for potential surges in cases.  Finally, public health campaigns have also been instrumental in raising awareness of the virus and encouraging people to take safety precautions, such as washing their hands and wearing masks.  Overall, it is clear that a combination of public health measures can be effective in containing the spread of a virus. While no measure is foolproof, the successful containment of the virus in many countries has proved that it can be done.']",
891,Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It.,"['The coronavirus pandemic has brought the phrase ""flatten the curve"" into our everyday lexicon. Though the phrase was coined by epidemiologists, it's now been adopted by politicians and celebrities alike. President Trump and Fox News have been among the loudest advocates for flattening the curve.  The idea behind flattening the curve is straightforward: By implementing social distancing and other measures, we can slow the spread of the virus and prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Flattening the curve does not guarantee that everyone will survive the virus — but it does buy us time to develop treatments and build up supplies of vital medical equipment.  It's encouraging that we now have some degree of consensus on the goal of flattening the curve. However, the success of this strategy hinges on whether we can agree to take the necessary steps to achieve it — and whether we can convince those who are skeptical of it. Trump and Fox have done much to raise awareness, but they must continue to make the case for why social distancing and other measures are necessary.  Ultimately, flattening the curve requires consistent messaging, widespread compliance, and a concerted effort on all levels — from the federal government down to individuals. The next step is to ensure that we all work together, regardless of political affiliation, to do what's needed to make the curve truly flatten.']",
892,The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"['The mystery of the missing bus riders was solved when investigators discovered that the bus riders had been kidnapped by a gang of criminals. The criminals had forced the bus riders onto a waiting van, and then driven them to a remote location where they were kept for several days until the ransom was paid. After the ransom was paid, the bus riders were allowed to go free. The police were finally able to identify and arrest the gang members, and all of the missing bus riders were returned to their families safely.  The mystery of the missing bus riders could have a few possible explanations. The first is that the bus riders may simply have missed their bus stop or got off at a different stop than the expected one. Another possibility is that the bus riders got off the bus earlier and took another form of transportation. It is also possible that someone may have kidnapped the bus riders or that they were a victim of foul play. Lastly, the bus riders may have simply decided to not take the bus and gone somewhere else instead.  The mystery of the missing bus riders is a case that may never be solved. This story began in December of 2016 when five students from Washington State University's campus in Seattle, WA, boarded a bus to get home one night. However, the bus never made it to its destination, and all five students, who have not been seen since that night, have been listed as missing persons.   The police have been investigating the case ever since, but there have been few clues or leads. The passengers' belongings were still on the bus when it was found abandoned, and there were no signs of foul play. The only information that has been uncovered is that the bus driver had checked in with the dispatcher twice and then reported the bus as being stuck in traffic. Unfortunately, there has been no trace of the passengers since that call.  While there is still a chance that the students may pop up somewhere, the mystery of the missing bus riders has yet to be solved. It is possible that the students may have voluntarily left the bus and gone on their own way, or that foul play was involved and the students were taken against their will.  At this time, the only hope of solving this mystery is to keep looking and to ask anyone who may have seen or heard something that could lead to clues. Until then, the mystery of the missing bus riders will remain unsolved.']",

Agnes of the Desert is a 1967 experimental film by the Spanish director Luis Buñuel, which became an international sensation after its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival. The film follows the story of a Mexican peasant woman, Agnes, who leaves her family to escape the oppressive confines of village life and seek spiritual enlightenment. Despite the low budget and lack of professional crew, the film's dreamlike imagery and surrealist elements, combined with Buñuel's signature dark wit, have earned it legendary status in the history of modern art.  The film is an early example of Buñuel's exploration of the psychological implications of restrictive societies and the hidden potential of the human spirit. Despite being made for a relatively small audience, Agnes of the Desert has impacted a variety of mediums, from theater and television to literature, inspiring generations of artists and filmmakers. The film is also one of the earliest works to bring the spiritual aesthetics of the Desert Fathers to a mainstream audience.  The acquisition of Agnes of the Desert is an important milestone in the museum's mission to preserve and showcase the very best of modern art, and to acknowledge the inspiring impact of the works of the modernist movement. The inclusion of the film in the permanent collection is a significant testament to its lasting power, and a testament to Buñuel's immense talent, whose work continues to captivate audiences around the world.']",

The actual number could be higher or lower, as it is dependent on a number of factors, including how effective social distancing measures are in slowing the spread of the virus, the availability of effective treatments, and the ability of medical systems to treat those who become severely ill.  The worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths, as of April 2020, vary significantly depending on the source. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that, assuming no effective interventions, anywhere between 160,000 and 214,000 Americans could die from coronavirus-related illnesses. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that up to 240,000 Americans could die from coronavirus-related illnesses. The White House Coronavirus Task Force estimates the potential death toll could reach as high as 3 million Americans.']",

The Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that the death toll could exceed 520,000 by the end of 2020. The White House has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 240,000 by mid-July.  The worst-case estimates for U.S. coronavirus deaths range from 200,000 to 2.2 million depending on the degree of social distancing and other preventive measures. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that if no preventative measures are taken, between 200,000 and 1.7 million people in the U.S. could die from COVID-19. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington is estimating that between 100,000 and 2.2 million people in the U.S. could die of the disease. It's important to note that these estimates only reflect the worst-case scenario and that the actual number of deaths could be much lower with aggressive measures such as social distancing and preventive actions.']",
900,Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System,"[', Modify Testing  The coronavirus pandemic has had a severe impact on the New York City school system and its students. In response, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Department of Education are taking a variety of measures to protect the health and safety of students and staff.  For the 2020-2021 school year, Mayor de Blasio has announced that the school year will be split into three parts, with all students beginning the school year remotely, before transitioning to a hybrid system in which some students attend school in person. He has also mandated that all students and staff wear masks and practice social distancing while attending in-person classes. The city has also implemented a modified testing regime, with selective school closure and a move to virtual learning if the infection rate increases in certain areas.  The city has also launched a number of new initiatives to help keep students and staff safe. This includes the distribution of half a million masks to students and staff, the introduction of enhanced cleaning protocols, and the installation of an additional 5,000 air filtration systems in buildings. Additionally, students and staff will also receive regular COVID-19 testing.  Despite these measures, the New York City school system is facing immense pressure from parents, students, and teachers to completely close schools and move to full-time virtual learning. The city is also struggling to ensure that all students have access to the technology and resources needed to effectively participate in the virtual learning model. A recent survey found that over 30% of city students lack access to the internet.  Overall, the New York City school system has been under immense pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor de Blasio and the Department of Education are taking a variety of measures to protect students and staff, while also attempting to provide an equitable and accessible remote learning experience. However, many parents and educators remain concerned about the potential risks associated with in-person instruction and are pushing for the continued implementation of virtual learning.']",

902,Opinion | The Pandemic vs. The President,"['The pandemic has been a wild ride for all of us, from the early stages of the novel coronavirus to the current situation of a severe, mutating virus that has wreaked havoc in our lives and the lives of those around us. We must now come to terms with the staggering number of deaths, the economic devastation, and the mental health fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has been at the forefront of the fight against the virus. While his initial response was widely criticized by his own party, the President has since taken drastic actions such as implementing a travel ban from China and invoking the Defense Production Act. His administration has also been very supportive of distribution of medical supplies and the implementation of testing. He has encouraged people to wear masks and has also provided federal assistance to small businesses.  However, it is widely argued that the President has failed to take this pandemic seriously, often downplaying the virus and continuing to host large events such as rallies and fundraisers, despite social distancing guidelines set forth by the CDC. His messaging has been inconsistent and confusing and he has not been much of a leader on the health care front. Trump has also used the pandemic to promote his political views and to undermine the efforts of state and local governments.  As the virus continues to spread, it is becoming increasingly clear that the President's response to the pandemic has been inadequate. He has failed to rise to the challenge and to provide leadership during a time of crisis. Sadly, the consequences of his failed leadership will be felt for years to come.']",
903,Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.,"['It is certainly heartbreaking to hear about two women falling ill from the coronavirus, and even more so to learn that only one of them survived. While the exact reasons for such an outcome are unknown and can vary from patient to patient, it is important to remember that the virus does not discriminate, and can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, race or ethnicity. It is also important to remember that everyone can take proactive steps to reduce their risk of contracting the virus, including following public health protocols such as wearing a face mask in public, social distancing, and frequently washing our hands with soap and water. Taking these steps will help ensure that we all have the best chance of staying healthy during this pandemic.  It is always tragic when someone falls ill with the coronavirus, and even more so when two people are affected. We are relieved to hear that one of them has survived, and we hope that the other recovers soon. It is also reassuring to know that there are treatments available to help patients recover from the virus. Despite the circumstances, this is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is hope and progress being made.']",
904,Meet the New Drive-Through: A Coronavirus Clinic Serving Up Swabs,"['and Tests  The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we live, and one of the newest innovations is the drive-through coronavirus clinic. These clinics are popping up across the United States, offering coronavirus testing and swabbing for those who may be infected.  The drive-through clinic works like your average drive-through: you drive up and are immediately greeted by a healthcare professional who is wearing protective gear and can ask you a few questions about your symptoms and possible exposure. From there, a simple nasal swab or saliva test can be administered through the window. Results are often available within an hour, and some clinics are able to provide results electronically.  The convenience of the drive-through clinic has made it an invaluable tool during the pandemic. By providing quick, efficient testing, the clinics are helping health officials identify cases early on and track the spread of the virus. They are also helping to reduce the burden on hospitals and other healthcare facilities, as those who may have been infected can get tested without having to book an appointment or wait in line.  The drive-through clinic is just one way that the coronavirus pandemic is changing the way we live. As more and more clinics are popping up in various states and cities, they are becoming a valuable resource for those who need testing and care.']",
905,Efforts to Control Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme,"['Since the coronavirus pandemic began, the U.S. has taken unprecedented steps to try to slow the spread of the virus. The most visible measures have included school closures, business shutdowns, travel restrictions, and stay-at-home orders. But now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that states consider even more extreme measures — such as mandating face masks in public, imposing strict social distancing rules, and closing down non-essential businesses — in order to help curb the spread of the virus.  These new recommendations come as the U.S. continues to grapple with record numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths. In many states, hospitals are struggling to handle the influx of patients and medical supplies are becoming increasingly scarce. In some areas, officials have even resorted to turning away patients due to a lack of beds or personnel.  At this point, it’s clear that the only way to truly get the virus under control is for everyone to take the necessary steps to keep themselves and those around them safe. Wearing a mask in public, washing hands often, and maintaining a physical distance of at least six feet are all important steps that can help reduce the spread of the virus.  The CDC’s recommendations are just that — recommendations — but states and local governments have the power to enact stricter measures should they deem it necessary. For example, at least 16 states have enacted some form of a face mask mandate, while several cities and counties have taken the additional step of imposing social distancing regulations. In some areas, government officials have even ordered the closure of non-essential businesses, such as movie theaters, bars, and hair salons.  Ultimately, it’s up to individuals to do their part in stopping the spread of the virus. But the government also has a role to play in instituting measures that can help slow the spread of the virus and protect public health. Hopefully, the steps taken thus far will be enough — but if not, there could be more extreme measures on the horizon.']",
906,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['The United States is quickly becoming a nation on edge, marked by a growing divide between Americans of all backgrounds, political persuasions, and ideologies. Amidst a pandemic, economic collapse, and nationwide protests highlighting the long-standing systemic racism within the United States, the ability of President Donald Trump to unify the country and lead remains in question.   Trump has not been able to rise to the occasion as many had hoped. His response to the protests has not been adequate, as critics say he has failed to touch on the root issues of institutional racism and inequality. Furthermore, he has been unable to articulate a strong and consistent plan to reinvigorate the economy, while other nations have implemented comprehensive plans, such as Germany’s $13.6 trillion package.   Trump’s lack of leadership has been further evident in his inability to foster dialogue and cultivate public support around proposed solutions. His rhetoric on the protests have been divisive rather than unifying, which has only served to further divide the nation. His comments, including his suggestion that protesters could be shot and an attack on religion, have been widely criticized.   Trump has also failed to bring together all sides of the political spectrum to create meaningful change. Although he has met with protestors and members of the Black community, it has been seen as a shallow and inadequate gesture, as no tangible progress or progress has been made.   Ultimately, President Trump’s lack of unifying leadership has hindered the country’s ability to heal and move forward in harmony. As the nation continues to be divided and embroiled in crisis, it is clear that the current president has not been able to effectively bridge the gaps between Americans and lead the country out of its current chaos.']",
907,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['As America deals with the COVID-19 pandemic and a nation on edge, President Donald Trump has struggled to unify the country. Since taking office, Trump has been a polarizing leader who has divided Americans along ideological, economic and racial boundaries. From his callous handling of natural disasters, to his inflammatory rhetoric and disdain for the media, Trump has created an atmosphere of mistrust and fear.  The president has had opportunities to lead the nation through turbulent times, but his lack of decorum and compassion has often left citizens feeling disheartened, frustrated and at odds with one another. Trump has seemed to prioritize his own political agenda over the needs of the people and the dire situation that many Americans are facing. His insensitive and tone-deaf remarks in times of crisis have alienated many who were hoping for a leader to bring the country together.  The president has continually failed to demonstrate empathy for the victims of the pandemic, instead choosing to tout his own successes and ignore any criticism. In addition, his rhetoric has further inflamed the deep divisions that have long plagued the United States. Rather than attempting to bridge these gaps, Trump has only widened them by stirring up anger and animosity amongst the population.  In the midst of a global pandemic and civil unrest, Trump has remained in the background, unable to provide the kind of leadership that the nation desperately needs. With his divisive policies, lack of empathy, and unwillingness to cooperate, Trump has failed to utilize his position of power to be a unifying force. Without strong and compassionate leadership to combat the current issues, the nation is left with a bystander in the Oval Office.']",
908,Afraid of Coronavirus? That Might Say Something About Your Politics,"['There is some evidence that people’s fears of the Coronavirus may be related to their political views. Studies conducted in the United States have shown that people who identify with the Republican Party were more likely than Democrats to feel afraid of contracting the virus, to believe that its severity has been exaggerated, and to be skeptical of the effectiveness of public policies to contain it. It was also found that those with more conservative views were more likely to use preventative behaviors to avoid the virus. This suggests that people’s views on the Coronavirus pandemic might be related to their political beliefs.  The fear of the Coronavirus pandemic is largely shaped by political beliefs. Those on the right tend to underestimate the severity of the virus, while those on the left tend to overestimate its severity. Those on the right are more likely to downplay the virus, while those on the left are more likely to take more strict preventative measures such as wearing masks and social distancing. This can be attributed to the fact that those on the right are more likely to view the virus as a potential threat to freedom and the economy, while those on the left are more likely to view the virus as a potential health threat to vulnerable populations. As a result, individuals’ reactions to the pandemic are largely shaped by their political beliefs.']",

This is a time to rest and reflect, and usually a welcome respite from the hot and busy days of Rocky Season.,  the change of seasons can be a difficult time for many. During Rocky Season, the weather tends to be warmer and more humid than during No Season.

Itâs the Drama.,"['It's true that the music and lyrics of a song can contribute to an emotional experience for the listener, but the most important factor in creating a powerful and memorable song is the drama. The drama within the music and lyrics helps to evoke a visceral reaction from the listener. A great song creates a narrative that the listener can relate to, and then builds up the tension until the resolution that the listener was expecting. Without drama, the song would feel flat and uninspired, and would most likely not be memorable. Therefore, the drama is the most important factor in creating a powerful and memorable song.  For many people, the most important part of a song is not the music, not the lyrics, but the drama. The drama of a song is what captivates the listener and makes them feel the emotions of the song. It's the drama that brings the story of the song to life.  The drama of a song is often created by the nuances of the music and the lyrics. The interplay between a song’s melody, rhythm, and lyrics creates an emotional atmosphere that draws a listener in.

Despite the fact that she was abducted by Boko Haram along with her colleagues, Hauwa refused to renounce her Christian faith and was later executed. Her courage and dedication to her work inspired many other women to stand up against Boko Haram and to continue providing aid and assistance to those affected by the conflict.

The best way to prevent that from happening is to take the steps necessary to stop the virus from spreading, such as following safety protocols, getting tested regularly and supporting one another whenever possible.  At this moment, it is impossible to predict exactly how much worse the coronavirus pandemic could get. We can make predictions, however, based on what has happened so far and what scientific experts are saying.   The coronavirus pandemic has already had an unprecedented effect on the world population and the global economy. In the United States alone, over 25 million people have contracted the virus and over 400,000 people have died. In many other countries, the numbers are even higher.   Experts are predicting that the pandemic is likely to get worse before it gets better. As the virus continues to spread, more people will be infected. And because the virus mutates, there is a possibility that it could become more contagious, more deadly, or more resistant to vaccines.   If the virus continues to spread and mutate, there is a possibility that it could become harder to control. This could mean that more people would succumb to the virus and that restrictions such as lockdowns and social distancing would have to be extended for longer periods of time.   It is also possible that the virus could become more widespread in countries where healthcare systems are already overburdened. This could lead to higher death tolls and even more strain on medical infrastructure.   Experts are still trying to understand the virus, and it is unclear how much worse it could get. However, it is likely that the virus will continue to spread and mutate, and that its effects on the world will be felt for some time.']",
921,Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus,"['It is clear that the government has failed to effectively respond to the coronavirus pandemic. From the very beginning, the government has been slow to act to protect its citizens and has instead focused on the economy. This late response and lack of strategic planning has led to a lack of comprehensive testing, inadequate funding of safety measures, and a general lack of clear guidelines.  The government’s failure has been particularly exacerbated in the United States. This failure is partially due to the federal government’s refusal to work with the states to create consistent rules and regulations. Similarly, the federal government has failed to provide essential protective items, such as masks and PPE, for the most vulnerable citizens.  Furthermore, it appears that the government is more concerned with the economic impact of the pandemic than protecting its citizens. The Trump administration has continually refused to extend weekly unemployment benefits, which has led to a rise in poverty and inequality. Furthermore, the government has failed to put in place policies that would protect businesses from collapsing due to the pandemic.  The government’s failure to effectively respond to the coronavirus pandemic has caused immense pain and suffering for many Americans. The government must be held accountable for its lack of action and must work to ensure that citizens are protected and governments are prepared for future crises.']",
922,Opinion | Itâs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"['The Trump administration's response to the pandemic has been an epic embarrassment and failure. From the president's cavalier dismissal of the virus to his unwillingness to provide needed testing and treatment to his refusal to follow the guidelines from experts, the American people have been left to fend for themselves.  Now, with a record number of cases and deaths, the Trump administration's gross negligence and mishandling of the crisis is on full display. The president has attempted to distract from the reality of the situation, by labeling himself a ""wartime president"" and repeating empty platitudes about ""winning"" the fight against the virus. The president's rhetoric has been wholly ineffective, and the U.S. is now the epicenter of the global pandemic.  Rather than practice social distancing and implement other measures to protect the public, the president continues to hold large indoor rallies and host gatherings with minimal mask wearing. Unfortunately, as we have seen in places with similar gatherings, such as the White House, these events have become dangerous breeding grounds for the virus.  The Trump administration should take responsibility for their mismanagement of the crisis. It is time to put an end to the MAGA marches and gatherings, and instead focus on the measures that are necessary to contain the virus: wearing masks, social distancing, appropriate testing and contact tracing, and having federal and statewide policies that prioritize public health.  It is time for the Trump administration to lead by example and do what is necessary to contain the virus. Anything less is a disservice to the American people.']",
923,Opinion | Letâs Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses,"['The criminal justice system in the United States is in need of reform. The current system has been shown to be overly punitive and disproportionately affects minority communities, leading to overcrowded prisons and a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty. There is a need for changes that will make the system more equitable and efficient. One solution would be to move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses.  Moving courts online would allow for faster resolution of minor cases, freeing up resources and allowing judges to focus on more serious cases. Additionally, it would be more convenient for both the accused and the court system as the accused would not need to appear in person, saving time and money. Furthermore, moving courts online would allow for greater access to justice, allowing those unable to appear in person to have an equal chance in court.  Suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would also have a positive effect. This would make justice more accessible to those unable to afford bail, which would reduce the population of pretrial detainees, leading to less overcrowding in jails. Additionally, it would reduce reliance on cash bail, which disproportionately affects low-income groups, by removing the incentive to commit crime in order to pay for bail.  Overall, moving courts online and suspending bail for nonviolent offenses could have a positive impact on the criminal justice system. It would make the system more efficient and equitable, as well as reduce overcrowding in jails. It is time for the criminal justice system to move into the 21st century and embrace technology to improve access to justice for all.']",

The marquees are dark, The actors all away, The song of the night Is a lonely one, today.  The crowds all gone, The music all hushed, Distant from us now But still felt, in a way.  A sigh through the night  As it drifts on the wind, The songs of Broadway Will rise again.  The tap of dance, The soft sound of lyrics, The joy of a night will live on in our spirits.

925,The Rise and Fall of M.B.S.âs Digital Henchman,"['The rise and fall of M.B.S.’s (Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS) digital henchman is an interesting story that can teach us a lot about the power of technology to influence politics and power dynamics. In the early days of MBS’s reign in Saudi Arabia, he used a digital henchman network of mostly anonymous social media accounts to shape the public conversation about his rule and suppress dissent. He used a system of bots, automated scripts, and fake accounts to spread positive messages about himself and his government, and to target opponents of his rule.  At first glance, it seemed as though MBS’s digital henchman was successful. His popularity grew, as did his grip on power in the kingdom. However, this success was short-lived. MBS’s henchman was eventually exposed for what it was: an army of bots and trolls spreading disinformation and propaganda. This revelation diminished MBS’s public support, and the Saudi people rose up to challenge his power.  The rise and fall of MBS’s digital henchman is a cautionary tale about the misuse of technology in politics. It shows us how powerful tools can be used to manipulate public opinion and suppress dissent, even in a country where freedom of expression is supposedly protected. It also serves as a reminder that, while technology can be a powerful tool, it must be used responsibly and ethically.']",
926,Opinion | A Story From Inside the Coronavirusâ Early Whirlwinds,"['I had come to understand that the coronavirus was serious business, and yet, like many, I wasn’t prepared for how quickly and deeply it would affect my life.   In early March, I started to feel a tickle in my throat, a minor soreness that I attributed to the cold winter air. But I also noticed an exhaustion that seemed to come out of nowhere, one that couldn’t be solved with a good night’s sleep. Then, the coughing started.   My first thought, of course, was that I had contracted the coronavirus. I went to my doctor, who ordered tests—which all came back negative. He said it was probably just a cold and recommended that I rest and drink plenty of fluids.   Still, I continued to worry. I took extra precautions, working from home whenever possible, avoiding large gatherings, and wearing a mask in public.   My symptoms eventually got worse, and I started to experience body aches and a fever. I was terrified; I thought the final test was going to come back positive. Thankfully, it didn’t, but I was diagnosed with a severe case of the flu.   I was relieved, but my experience was a reminder of how quickly things can change in the time of coronavirus. We have to remain vigilant and aware of what’s going on around us—and take care of our health in any way we can.']",
927,Opinion | Theyâve Contained the Coronavirus. Hereâs How.,"['The coronavirus pandemic is one of the greatest health challenges the world has faced in recent history. But some countries have managed to contain the spread of the virus and protect their citizens.  The key to success has been a combination of factors that are specific to each country and region, but many of the best practices are applicable worldwide.  Some of the most important ingredients for success are strict lockdown measures, the establishment of testing and contact tracing protocols, the implementation of physical distancing measures, the availability of personal protective equipment, the encouragement of good hygiene practices, and the provision of adequate healthcare staffing and resources.  In addition, some countries which have been successful at containing the spread of the virus have adopted public health incentives such as cash transfers, housing and food subsidies, and other forms of assistance for those who have been hit hardest by the crisis.  In most cases, the successful containment of the virus was only possible thanks to swift and decisive action from governments, as well as the compliance of citizens to the guidelines.  With the availability of vaccines, some countries have already begun to loosen their restriction measures and return to relative normality. However, it is essential that all of us remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines, as the fight against the virus is far from over.']",
928,Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It.,"['The way to flatten the curve of Covid-19 is through public awareness, individual and collective action, and robust governmental response. Unfortunately, President Trump and Fox News have done a poor job of advocating for these measures. Instead, they have focused on downplaying the severity of the virus, undermining public health experts, and spreading false information in an effort to protect their own political interests.  Trump has repeatedly questioned the credibility of the advice of public health officials, claiming that they were “wrong” about the virus and its potential impact. He has also attacked the media for their coverage of the crisis, further undermining the American public’s trust in the experts.  Fox News, meanwhile, has lent its platform to personalities who have spread false information about Covid-19, likening it to the common flu and dismissing the need for social distancing measures. By doing so, they have failed to reinforce the seriousness of the virus and the importance of following expert-backed protocols.  Overall, Trump and Fox have done a disservice to the American people by not amplifying the message of public health experts and by attempting to discredit their advice. By not adequately pushing the need to flatten the curve, these two entities have put many at risk. It is vital that they start taking the crisis seriously and work to support public health initiatives, as they owe it to their constituents.']",
929,The Mystery of the Missing Bus Riders,"['First, you should contact the bus company and report the missing riders. Ask if they can provide information such as video footage of the riders on the bus or the riders’ last known location. Additionally, you should contact the police and file a missing persons report for the missing riders. You should also inform the family members and friends of the missing riders. Ask if they have any information that might help locate the riders.  Next, initiate a thorough investigation. Check with local hospitals and shelters to see if the riders have been admitted, and contact area businesses to see if they’ve been seen around the area. Additionally, review all public transportation records for the past few days to see if the riders have used any other forms of transportation. You should also review any CCTV footage in the area to see if the riders have been spotted.  Lastly, reach out to the public. Ask people in the area if they’ve seen the riders, or if they know people who know the riders. If necessary, you can put up flyers with the description of the missing riders and ask anyone with information to contact the police or family members.  The first step to solving this mystery is to identify any potential suspects. This could include any drivers of other buses, local pedestrians or anyone else who had access to the area at the time of the disappearance. It is important to interview witnesses who may have seen something suspicious or unusual at the time of the bus riders' disappearance.  Once potential suspects have been identified, it is important to collect evidence. This includes CCTV footage, phone records and any other data that may help paint a clearer picture of what happened. It is also important to analyze any physical evidence that may have been left at the scene or collected from potential suspects.   In addition, any potential clues should be investigated. If the bus riders were seen taking any unusual routes or actions before their disappearance, these should be investigated further. It is also important to speak with family and friends of the bus riders to gain any additional insight.  Once all the evidence has been collected, a timeline of events should be created. This should include all the times and locations of the disappearance as well as any other pertinent events that may have occurred before or after. With this timeline, a clearer picture of what happened to the bus riders can be determined.  Finally, it is important to share all the findings and evidence with the appropriate authorities. If a suspect has been identified, they should be brought in for questioning to help further the investigation.   By following these steps, the mystery of the missing bus riders can be solved.']",

Air Transport  Cargo  Cargo is goods (or merchandise) transported by aircraft, it may refer to both mail and goods. It also includes goods carried in an aircraft's hold, such as freight. In the aviation industry, cargo is typically classified according to size and weight. The categories of size and weight include bulky cargo, loose cargo, mail, oversized cargo, palletized cargo, and unit load devices (ULDs).  Cargo is typically transported in two ways: by air charter, or by an airline's scheduled service. Air charter involves renting a plane and its crew for a specific mission. Airline service involves booking space for cargo on regularly scheduled flights.  Cargo air transport is an important part of the global economy. It facilitates international trade, makes it possible to ship goods quickly and efficiently, and helps reduce the cost of transporting goods from one place to another. Cargo carriers are increasingly using technology such as electronic data interchange (EDI) to track and manage shipments. EDI helps air carriers and their customers to exchange information about shipments in real time.   In recent years, the emergence of e-commerce has caused a rapid increase in the demand for cargo air transport. This is because the growth of e-commerce has created a large amount of demand for the rapid delivery of goods. As a result, airlines have been forced to increase their cargo capacity and services in order to meet this demand. This has led to greater competition in the industry and a decrease in airfreight rates, making cargo air transport even more attractive.']",

In a speech to the conservative Federalist Society in Washington, Mr Barr said the ""bogus narrative"" of collusion had been ""perpetuated for more than two years"".  The attorney general said the Russia probe was launched ""on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken"".  Mr Barr's speech reflects President Donald Trump's long-standing insistence that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia.  Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which has now concluded, found evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US election but did not establish that Mr Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow.  Mr Barr suggested that the clear lack of evidence of collusion should lead to questions about why the investigation had dragged on for so long.

958,BBC News,"['April 24, 2018  For the first time, scientists have been able to observe the effects of high-temperature superconductivity in action. The breakthrough was achieved by a team of researchers from the University of Tokyo, who developed a technique that allowed them to observe the physics of superconductivity at temperatures over 100 degrees Celsius.  The research was published in the journal Nature and offers a major breakthrough in the field of superconductivity. For many years, scientists have been unable to observe the physical properties of superconductivity at such high temperatures. This research has now made it possible to do so, and it could open the door to developing new materials that could lead to the development of more energy efficient devices and technology.  The team used a special laser to excite the electrons in a superconducting material and measure the electrical current as it passed through the material. This allowed them to observe the properties of the material at temperatures that had previously been inaccessible.  The research could be a major step forward in the development of superconducting materials, which could be used in many areas, including energy storage and transmission. Superconductors are able to efficiently store and transmit electricity without any resistance, and this could potentially lead to the development of more efficient electrical devices.  The team is now planning to explore the implications of their research further, and to see if they can find ways to increase the temperature range of their observations. They hope that their research will open up new possibilities for the development of more efficient electrical devices and technologies.']",

Sanders then pointed to the fact that his campaign has garnered support from voters under age 30 across the country, noting that he has won the youth vote in every primary contest so far.

After months of reflection, I am proud to endorse Joe in his quest to become the leader of our great nation.”  Booker's endorsement follows similar endorsements from other former Democratic presidential challengers, such as senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, and former mayor Pete Buttigieg. in  Democratic presidential race  Former Vice President Joe Biden has been endorsed by another one of his former rivals in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, Sen.

977,Super Tuesday: Why didn't more young people vote?,"['There are a variety of possible explanations for why more young people may not have voted in Super Tuesday. One possible explanation is a lack of knowledge about the voting process and the candidates running for office. Young people are often less engaged in the political process than other age groups, and may not have been aware of the election or how to register and cast a ballot. Another possible explanation is a lack of enthusiasm for the candidates or issues that were on the ballot. Many young people may not have found the candidates or issues motivating enough to prompt them to participate in the election. Finally, a lack of access to polls and registration sites may have been a barrier for some young people. Many states have restrictive voting laws that make it difficult for young people to access the polls or register to vote. These reasons, as well as other factors, may have contributed to the lower level of youth turnout for Super Tuesday.  While it is difficult to pinpoint one exact reason why more young people did not participate in Super Tuesday, there are several factors that likely contributed to the low turnout. Many young people lack the resources to easily participate in elections, such as the time and money needed to register to vote, and the ability to take time off of work or school to go to polling places. Additionally, young people may feel less informed than older generations about the political landscape, and may not have the same level of understanding of the issues and candidates at stake in Super Tuesday. Finally, young people may feel disconnected from the political process, and that their voice does not make a difference in the making of public policy. Thus, they may choose not to participate in elections.']",

979,Elizabeth Warren: Where did it go wrong for her?,"['Warren had a strong start to her campaign, but ultimately faced some significant headwinds. It began with a stiff primary race, in which Warren was unable to break away from the pack and establish a consistent lead in polls. Despite impressive fundraising numbers, a strong debate performance, and a strong grassroots campaign, she failed to translate that into a significant surge in the polls. Additionally, Warren’s plans, while well articulated, were often overshadowed by the more extreme proposals of two of her main opponents, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  In the end, Warren couldn’t break away from the pack and her support faded, with her ultimately withdrawing from the race after coming in third place in the Iowa caucuses. Ultimately, her inability to remain a viable candidate despite strong initial performances was likely due to a combination of factors, and her failure to break away from the rest of the pack in a crowded primary race.  Elizabeth Warren's campaign for president went wrong in several ways. First, she was unable to build a broad enough coalition of supporters to propel her to the White House. She struggled to excite the Democratic base and her poll numbers never reached the levels of her top rivals. She also faced an onslaught of attacks from President Donald Trump, who labeled her ""Pocahontas"" in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. Furthermore, her campaign failed to adequately address questions about her healthcare plan and other policy proposals. Finally, her campaign's resources were outmatched by those of her main rivals.']",
980,Anthony Zurcher,"['[T]he revelations coming out of a congressional report on the controversial tax practices of President Donald Trump’s family do not appear to pose any immediate legal threat to the president.  That being said, they should concern the president’s supporters and those who are curious about how America’s economic elite use the tax code to their advantage. The New York Times report revealed a variety of aggressive and controversial tactics – including alleged fraud – used by the Trump family to pay as little as possible in taxes over the course of several decades.  The use of permissible, if aggressive, methods for lowering taxes is commonplace in the wealthy classes, but these revelations come as the Trump administration presses for a new tax code with an emphasis on simplification. At the same time, it’s proposing major changes that critics say would further tilt the system in favor of the wealthy, who have the means to pay for high-powered tax advisors like those on the Trump payroll.  It’s difficult to make the case for tax reform when the public is learning about potential tax avoidance schemes used by the president and his family for years. The growing public scrutiny of the Trump family’s unorthodox approach to the tax system is likely to affect the prospects of his tax policies, as well as the president's political standing with voters.']",

983,Super Tuesday: BBC finds Bloomberg campaign offices empty,"['BBC reporters have uncovered that a number of the campaign offices of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is running in the Democratic primary for the US presidential election, are empty.  The reporters visited multiple locations across the US and found that in some cases no staff were present and that much of the equipment that should have been in the offices, such as phone lines, was missing. It is unclear what this means for the Bloomberg campaign, which was heavily dependent on his massive ad spending and the hundreds of offices across the country.  It is possible that the campaign is downsizing its efforts as the primary process moves toward Super Tuesday, when 14 states will decide whether or not to give their support to the former mayor. It is also possible that the offices are being used for other means, such as making calls and sending out mailers, which do not require physical offices.  The BBC has found empty campaign offices owned by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg in the crucial US state of Texas on Super Tuesday.   The offices were in the cities of Houston, Austin, Dallas and San Antonio and were rented by Bloomberg’s presidential campaign as part of its effort to compete in the state’s 15 March Democratic primary.  However, the BBC’s Jane O’Brian found that the campaign had already vacated the premises and almost all of the campaign staff had gone.  Bloomberg himself has not been to Texas since October, and he is currently focused on the other Super Tuesday states of Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama.   The billionaire candidate has ploughed millions of dollars into advertising and has hired thousands of staff to knock on doors in many of the 14 Super Tuesday states. But he has failed to gain much traction in Texas opinion polls.  Bloomberg’s campaign said the candidate had chosen to focus his strategy and resources on states with the greatest chance of success, and will continue to evaluate his strategy as the election cycle progresses.']",

990,Coronavirus updates: Borders shut as coronavirus cases rise,"['The number of coronavirus cases continues to rise around the world, and many countries are taking drastic measures to try and contain the virus. As of March 16th, many countries have closed their borders, restricted travel between countries, and issued national or regional lockdowns to try and limit the spread of the virus. Some of the countries that have taken such measures include China, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, India, and Australia. In addition to restrictions on travel, many countries are also closing schools, public spaces, and businesses in an effort to further limit the spread of the virus. As the situation continues to evolve, more countries are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks and months.  In response to the rising number of coronavirus cases around the world, many countries have tightened their borders to prevent the spread of the virus. Many countries have closed their borders to foreign visitors and are limiting the number of people allowed to enter the country. In some cases, they are placing restrictions on travelers from certain countries or regions, while in other cases they are suspending all incoming and outgoing travel.  In the United States, President Donald Trump has implemented several measures, including suspending all travel from the European Schengen area, which includes 26 European countries. Additionally, all nonessential travel has been restricted across the US borders.  Other countries have imposed even stricter measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In Russia, the government has closed its borders to the majority of foreign travelers. In the United Kingdom, the government has implemented a 14-day quarantine for anyone entering the country, and travelers from certain countries have been banned from entering the country.  As the virus continues to spread around the world, many countries are taking extreme measures to contain it. As a result, borders are more restricted than ever before, and travelers should expect longer wait times at airports and border checkpoints.']",
991,Coronavirus: Why does the UK have more modest controls?,"['The UK has taken a different approach to controlling the spread of the coronavirus compared to some other countries. While some countries have implemented strict lockdowns with travel restrictions, the UK has opted for a more nuanced approach, relying on mass testing, contact tracing, and social distancing measures such as the ""Rule of 6"".   The UK's approach is rooted in its public health system which has historically been more decentralised and less centralised than many other countries. This gives the government more ability to tailor their response to the local situations, rather than implementing uniform nation-wide measures.   The UK is also heavily reliant on voluntary actions, such as wearing face masks, instead of more stringent measures such as mandatory masks. This has been a controversial move and the government is now looking to introduce more stringent measures in response to a recent surge in cases.  The UK has adopted a more cautious approach to controlling the spread of coronavirus due to a variety of factors. The UK's health care system is already stretched due to its high rates of reliance on the National Health Service, and the government has expressed concern that imposing stringent measures would put extra strain on the system. The UK has also chosen to focus on strategies such as widespread testing and contact tracing as part of its efforts to keep the spread of the virus in check. This approach has been described as 'controlled suppression'.']",

995,Coronavirus pandemic,"['The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020. As of December 2020, the virus has spread to over 200 countries, with confirmed cases reaching 77,625,962 and resulting in 1,711,930 deaths.   Measures taken to combat the pandemic vary from country to country, with some implementing lockdowns, travel restrictions, and quarantines, as well as closing schools, non-essential businesses, and other public spaces. In addition to physical restrictions, many countries have implemented emergency economic response programs to mitigate some of the economic impacts of the pandemic. These measures have been used to support the health care system, protect jobs, and provide economic relief to individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic.   Governments around the world have also accelerated efforts to develop a vaccine to protect individuals from infection.

996,Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy,"['1. Different Responses: The UK has reacted differently to the outbreak than the Italian government. The UK has acted quickly to put in place social distancing measures including the closure of pubs and restaurants, while Italy put in place a total lockdown much earlier.   2. Different Health Systems: The UK has a different approach to healthcare, with the NHS focusing on preventative care rather than large-scale hospitalization of patients. This means that the UK has focused on early containment of the virus to try and prevent large numbers of cases, rather than having to resort to the same large-scale hospitalization as Italy.   3. Different Populations: The UK is more densely populated than Italy, making it more difficult to keep potential contact between individuals to a minimum. Additionally, there are differences in the overall health of the two populations that could influence the course of the virus. For example, Italy has a lower life expectancy and higher obesity rates than the UK, which could affect how individuals respond to the virus.  1. Heavier Restrictions: The UK government took strong measures early on, such as closing schools and restricting travel and public gatherings much sooner than Italy. This has helped to slow the spread of the virus.   2. Different Age Demographics: Italy has a much older population compared to the UK, with the average age at 45.7 compared to the UK’s 40.7. Age is a key factor when it comes to the potential severity of the virus, which will likely lead to a lower death rate in the UK.   3. Different Healthcare Systems: The NHS in the UK is one of the best healthcare systems in the world and is well-resourced compared to that of Italy. This means that the UK is more likely to have better resources for tackling the virus and for providing care to those who are suffering.']",

998,Coronavirus: Europe now epicentre of the pandemic,"['Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Europe has become the epicentre of the virus, with the highest number of cases and deaths in the world.  At the time of writing, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) estimates that more than 10.3 million cases have been reported in the region, with over 303,000 deaths. This is the highest number of cases reported in the world, surpassing the United States, which has reported 9.6 million cases.  The hardest hit countries in Europe have been the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy, all of which have reported over one million cases each.  The number of cases and deaths have been on the rise in most European countries over the past two months, with countries in Central and Eastern Europe such as Russia, Poland, and Hungary proving to be the most affected.  The virus is spreading quickly in Europe due to the continent's dense population, and the difficulty in implementing and enforcing restrictions on a large scale due to the prevalence of different health systems in different countries.  In addition, the continent has seen a slower response from governments in comparison to other areas of the world, as well as delays in testing and contact tracing.  Efforts by European countries to bring the pandemic under control have included restrictions on movement, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, and increased use of contact tracing. The European Commission has also announced a package of measures to help countries respond to the pandemic, including a €750 billion recovery fund.  As the virus continues to spread in Europe, it is essential that governments work together to coordinate their strategies and suppression efforts to contain the virus.']",
999,Coronavirus: English local elections postponed for a year,"['The government has announced that local elections due to take place throughout England this May have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The move was welcomed by local authorities, who had been calling for the postponement as many staff members already had to take on additional duties in order to deal with the impact of the virus on their communities. The government has said it will provide additional resources to help local authorities to carry on delivering services during the period.  The decision means that current councillors will remain in post until elections can go ahead in May 2021. The government has also said it will look into ways to ensure that each candidate in the elections can have a ""level playing field”, irrespective of their financial resources.   The decision will come as a relief to councils, who had been concerned about how they would manage the necessary arrangements for the elections in the middle of a pandemic. It also means that councillors will now have an extra year to deliver services and respond to the crisis.  The government has announced that all local elections in England scheduled for May 2020 are to be postponed for 12 months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Local elections for mayors in seven major English cities - including London, Manchester, and Liverpool - will also be postponed.  The decision has been taken in order to reduce the risk of the disease spreading through large gatherings of people. The government has said that the elections will take place in May 2021, at the same time as scheduled.  This decision has been met with criticism from some local politicians in England who argued that it was unnecessary to delay the elections and that there were other measures that could be used to ensure the safety of voters. Despite this, the government has made it clear that the safety of the public is its priority.']",

The changes in hormones can cause drastic shifts in energy levels and mood, as well as physical symptoms that range from hot flashes to exhaustion. During this time, it is important to take care of yourself and practice self-care. This may include getting adequate rest and sleep, engaging in light to moderate exercise, managing stress levels, engaging in relaxation techniques, and eating a healthy balanced diet. Additionally, it may also be beneficial to speak to your doctor about potential treatments or medications that may help manage symptoms during perimenopause.  Perimenopause can cause a variety of physical and mental symptoms, such as changes in sleep patterns, fatigue, and decreased energy. If you have gone from triathlon training to needing naps, it could be a sign that you are entering perimenopause and it is important to talk to your doctor about your symptoms. They can help to determine the best course of action to take in managing your perimenopausal symptoms.  Perimenopause is a natural transition period in a woman's life when her body begins to prepare for menopause. This transition can last up to 10 years and can begin as early as 30 years of age, typically leading up to menopause at around age 50. During this time, it is not uncommon for women to experience a variety of physical and emotional changes that can have a significant impact on their lives. These changes can include irregular menstrual cycles, hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings as well as fatigue, disrupted sleep, and changes in appetite. Many women also find that their energy levels can fluctuate during this time, leading some to go from seemingly normal levels of activity to needing extra rest and naps.

Hundreds of people, including scores of Muslims, were killed in the violence.  One of the most shocking images to emerge from the violence was a photo of a man, Mubashir, who was surrounded by a mob carrying sticks and stones.  Mubashir, who was later identified as a Muslim, had suffered a brutal beating and was on the brink of death when the photo was taken.  When the photo was circulated, no one thought he would survive. “No one who saw the photo thought I would survive,” he said.  But despite the odds, Mubashir managed to survive. He was eventually rescued by the police and taken to a nearby hospital. He said the experience was one he would never forget.  “It was a nightmare. I thought I was going to die,” he said.  Mubashir's story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in times of hardship and tragedy. He was able to survive despite the odds and his story serves as an inspiration to all of us to never give up in the face of adversity.  The Delhi riots of February 2020 left a lasting and deadly mark on the city and its people. One of the people most affected by the unrest was Zeeshan Khan, who was shot in the chest and left for dead in the violence.  Khan said that he had seen the photo of himself lying on the road, severely injured, but believed he had no chance of surviving.  “When I saw the photo, I thought I was going to die,” Khan told the BBC. “No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive. I was shocked that I survived.”  Khan was taken to a hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet and was in a coma for several days. He eventually recovered and was released from the hospital a month later.  He has since set up a charity to help victims of the Delhi riots and is advocating for justice for those affected.']",

While female urinals could potentially help reduce wait times in some situations, this is not necessarily a solution for all gender restroom situations. Female urinals do not provide the same level of privacy that stall restrooms do for women, and some women may feel uncomfortable using them due to their unfamiliarity. Therefore, the best way to reduce wait times in gender restroom queues is to provide more stall restrooms for all genders.  No, female urinals are not the answer to queues at the loos.

Additionally, there are several logistical, economic, and cultural barriers to implementing female urinals.  No, female urinals are not likely to be the answer to queues at the loos.

Examples of honour-based violence include forced marriage, domestic abuse, and even murder.  In their campaign, Chaymaa and Zainab want to help those affected by honour hate to speak out and seek help.

Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia issued the order after Manning had served 62 days in jail for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. According to the judge, Manning’s refusal to testify was not in itself a contempt of court and that her incarceration was “no longer necessary” to try and compel her to testify. Manning had been subpoenaed to testify in the investigation of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and in regards to the leak of classified documents in 2010.

1014,Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"['The political chaos in Guinea-Bissau has created an atmosphere of lawlessness and instability which could allow drug traffickers to use the country as a transit point for their operations. According to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), cocaine trafficking in West Africa is one of the most serious transnational organized criminal activities. The country’s air and maritime borders are poorly monitored and the government is unable to effectively police the country’s territory, making it easy for traffickers to use the country for their operations.  In addition, Guinea-Bissau is located on the West African Coast and has direct access to the Atlantic Ocean, providing easy access to international markets for narcotics. Furthermore, with the country’s weak economic and governance structures, it is difficult for the government to control and regulate trafficking activities.  The political and security situation in Guinea-Bissau, combined with its strategic location, makes it a favourable environment for drug traffickers. In order to combat the problem, the government needs to take steps to strengthen its law enforcement capabilities and to increase international cooperation in order to stem the tide of illicit drugs entering the country. Additionally, it is essential to develop effective strategies to counter the organized criminal networks that are exploiting the country’s vulnerability and exploiting the poverty of its citizens.']",

In the US, the Trump administration has announced a ban on all travel from much of Europe to the US in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. The ban, which will go into effect on Friday night, will exclude the UK.   The EU has followed suit, suspending all non-essential travel from outside the bloc for 30 days.   In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a ban on large public gatherings and restaurants and bars will be told to close.   Germany has closed its borders with Austria, France and Switzerland, while Italy has shut its schools and universities and imposed a nationwide lockdown.   In Australia, the government is considering closing its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents, but has not yet made a final decision.   Many countries are taking additional steps to contain the virus, including China, which has introduced quarantine restrictions in some cities, and South Korea, which has put more than 10 million people under home isolation.   The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a pandemic, and is urging countries around the world to take “drastic action” to contain the spread of the virus.']",
1018,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"['The most common symptoms of coronavirus are fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.

1021,Coronavirus: Europe now epicentre of the pandemic,"['The World Health Organization has declared Europe the new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic. Countries across the continent are witnessing a surge in cases as the seasonal flu starts to wane, leaving the space to be occupied by the deadly Covid-19 virus.  The virus has spread rapidly across Europe, with countries like France, Italy, Spain, and Germany recording some of the highest rates of new infections. Other countries in the European Union, such as Romania, are also experiencing a surge in cases.  European authorities have implemented a number of measures to restrict the spread of the virus, including lockdowns in some countries and travel restrictions between other EU member states. Despite these measures, the infection rate is still climbing in many European countries, suggesting that the virus is firmly in control.  Given the speed with which new cases are being reported, it is likely that Europe will remain the epicentre of the pandemic for the foreseeable future, though this could change as the situation evolves.  The coronavirus pandemic is now centred on Europe, according to the World Health Organisation.  The WHO’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the disease had almost completely affected Europe and the region accounted for the highest number of cases and deaths in the world.  The WHO has warned the pandemic could still get worse.  “We cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: all countries can still turn the tide on this virus,” said Mr Ghebreyesus.  The latest data shows Europe has recorded more than one million cases, with the UK and Spain having the most.  The WHO has also said that Europe is seeing an increase in the number of health workers contracting the virus. That is partly attributed to a lack of protective equipment and overcrowded hospitals.  In addition, it has warned that Europe could be facing a second wave of the virus in the coming months.']",
1022,Coronavirus: Why systemic problems leave the US at risk,"['The United States is at risk of a significant outbreak of the coronavirus because of systemic problems in the country's healthcare system, from insufficient testing to inadequate access to healthcare.  The lack of universal healthcare coverage in the U.S. means that uninsured individuals are less likely to get tested for the virus, and if they do, are more likely to be taken to emergency rooms that lack the resources to adequately handle the influx of patients.  In addition, the country has not invested enough in the public health infrastructure that would be needed for responses to infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus. The number of public health experts in the United States continues to decline, making it more difficult for health authorities to respond to outbreaks.  Furthermore, the U.S. also has one of the highest rates of chronic health conditions in the world, such as obesity and diabetes, which can make an individual more likely to become infected and experience more severe symptoms.  Finally, the gap between the richest and poorest in the U.S. continues to widen and this inequality can create an environment where virus transmission is more likely, due to less access to resources and lack of information.']",
1023,The mother and the murderer,"['This is a difficult situation. The mother would likely be naturally devastated by the news that one of her children is a murderer. It is hard to say how a mother would react in such a situation as it is highly individual and dependent on the specific circumstances. Some mothers might respond with shock, anger, and grief as they grapple to make sense of the situation. Others might be more understanding of their child’s actions and may have an easier time forgiving them. In any case, the mother would likely feel intense emotions and would need time to process her feelings and come to terms with the news. = The mother and the murderer are two distinct and separate individuals who have no connection to each other.  If the mother of the murderer is alive then she will likely face mixed emotions of horror and sorrow. The horror will stem from the fact that her own flesh and blood has taken a life, while sorrow may come from the knowledge of the suffering her son will experience as a result of his actions. Depending on the circumstances and the level of involvement the mother had in raising her son, she may also experience a degree of guilt or responsibility for his actions.']",

The report says that while risks posed by the two countries have been known for some time, their increasingly aggressive behaviour and military advances have made them ""formidable"" threats to Canada and its allies.  The report specifically notes China's increasingly aggressive stance in the South China Sea, its efforts to expand its military capabilities in the Arctic, and its willingness to use diplomacy for its own purposes. In addition, it warns of Russia's aggressive military posture in eastern Europe, its use of cyberwarfare, and its willingness to use proxy states to pursue its objectives.  The report also notes that both countries have shown ""a willingness to challenge international rules and norms, and use a range of aggressive tactics"" in pursuit of their interests.  In order to address these growing threats, the report argues that Canada must invest in its defence capabilities, make robust use of diplomacy, and build coalitions with like-minded countries to deter aggression. Ultimately, the report concludes, Canada must be ""prepared to confront those who challenge its interests and values.""']",

The woman, who was four months pregnant, had reportedly been trying to cross the San Diego-Tijuana border when she fell. Her husband and two children, who were with her at the time, were able to make it to the United States. The woman was taken to a local hospital in critical condition before being transferred to a trauma center and eventually declared dead. The incident highlights the increasingly dangerous attempts to cross illegally into the United States, as well as the need for safe and legal pathways for people to migrate.  On May 19, 2019, a 25-year-old pregnant woman from Guatemala fell while attempting to climb a border wall separating the United States and Mexico near El Paso, Texas. She died at the scene. The woman’s family was trying to cross the border illegally and the woman had attempted to climb the wall after agents blocked their entry. The incident has raised further questions about the human costs of illegal immigration into the United States.  On June 5, 2020, a pregnant woman from Guatemala died after falling from the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The woman, identified as Victoria Maite Cano, had attempted to cross into the United States illegally when she fell. The fall happened near the town of Sunland Park, New Mexico. According to reports, Cano was six months pregnant, and she and her companion were reported to have been climbing the wall when she fell. The companion, who was not identified, was taken into custody by United States Border Patrol agents after the incident.

The strikes targeted five sites controlled by Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shia militia. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said the targets included weapons storage warehouses and command and control locations in Iraq.  “This proportionate military response was conducted together with diplomatic measures, including consultation with coalition partners,” Esper said in a statement.  The attack on the military base in Iraq’s Anbar province on Wednesday wounded four US troops and two members of the Iraqi security forces. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but US officials have blamed Iran-backed forces.  Esper went on to say that the US was “fully prepared to respond to any further attacks against US forces or interests”, and he urged Iran to cease its “provocative acts.”']",

Investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that pilot David Ibbotson was not licensed to fly a commercial passenger or cargo flight of this nature.   The AAIB report also said that the plane, a single-engined Piper Malibu aircraft, was not licensed to undertake the journey either.  The report said that Mr Ibbotson, who had held a UK private pilot’s licence since 1976, was not licensed to fly passengers for financial reward and the registration of the aircraft was not current.  The AAIB said there did not appear to be any evidence of recent fluctuations or technical problems with the aircraft and weather conditions were good.   The report said no distress call was made from the aircraft and the wreckage was located off the north coast of Guernsey in the English Channel. No survivors were found.   The body of Argentine footballer Mr Sala was recovered from the submerged wreckage two weeks after the plane went missing on 21 January 2019.  The pilot of the plane that crashed in the English Channel with Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala on board was not licensed to fly the aircraft, investigators have said.

The demonstration, which was organized by the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), was held in Bangkok and other cities around the country.  The protesters are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who took power in a military coup in 2014, and calling for the government to hold fresh elections. The demonstrators also want the government to scrap new laws that opponents fear will restrict their civil rights and weaken democracy.  The protest was peaceful and no clashes between security forces and protesters were reported. Security forces have deployed a large number of troops and police as a precaution, but have been largely restrained in their response to the protest.  The UDD has announced that more protests are planned in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen if the government will respond to the protesters' demands and make any concessions.  Thai opposition protesters gathered in Bangkok on Sunday in a rare demonstration against the military-backed government in a call for new elections and an end to intimidation by the authorities.  The protest, led by Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul and other student activists, had been authorised by police, however, it appears authorities quickly turned against the demonstrators.   As the protesters gathered in the city’s historic Democracy Monument, they waved the Thai flag and chanted the anthem of the pro-democracy movement. Police deployed officers and trucks along the demonstration route, while the government activated the Internal Security Act to prevent protesters from marching.  Some of the protesters were reportedly arrested and the rest were eventually dispersed by the police.  The protest comes as the country’s pro-democracy movement is gaining momentum.

1032,Coronavirus: Life inside China's lockdown,"['Life inside China's lockdown is extremely difficult for the residents of Hubei province, due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. The government has imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people in and out of the province as part of its efforts to contain the spread of the disease. This has resulted in a lockdown of unprecedented proportions, with most Chinese citizens unable to leave their homes or even visit the local community.  The lockdown has devastated local businesses and left people stuck in their homes with limited access to food and basic necessities. With shops and restaurants closed, people have had to rely on deliveries to get food and other essentials. The government has also implemented stringent quarantine and testing measures, making it difficult for people to find even the most basic supplies or access medical care.  The lockdown in Hubei has resulted in a major disruption of daily life. People have had to adjust to spending more time at home with their families, watching movies and playing video games. With the absence of leisure activities such as visiting restaurants, bars, and movie theatres, people have had to find other ways to entertain themselves.  The Chinese authorities have also implemented a number of measures to ensure the safety of its citizens. This includes the implementation of an ID system that requires citizens to wear special QR codes around their necks. The codes are used to track people's movements and ensure that they are in compliance with the lockdown restrictions.  Overall, life in Hubei has been difficult since the outbreak of the coronavirus.

1034,Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy,"['1. Different Government Actions: The UK government has responded to the coronavirus pandemic with a range of measures which have been more stringent than those put in place by the Italian government - including tighter restrictions on movement and tougher limits on public gatherings.  2. Different Social Trends: Italy has a more densely populated population and many people live in cramped city apartments, making social distancing more difficult - which has likely contributed to its high rate of infection and death. In contrast, the UK has a more rural population and much lower population density levels.  3. Different Healthcare Systems: The UK has a much better-funded healthcare system than Italy, with more resources available to treat and manage the virus. This should help to prevent a high rate of infection and death.  1. Different Response: The UK's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been much quicker and more decisive than that of Italy in terms of restrictions, lockdown and testing. This means that while the virus has been able to spread in Italy, in the UK it has been contained more effectively.  2. Healthcare System Capacity: The UK has a much more robust healthcare system than Italy. The UK has more hospital beds and ICU capacity per capita than Italy, meaning that the healthcare system in the UK is better equipped to cope with a surge in demand for medical treatment.  3. Demographic: The UK's population is much younger than that of Italy. This means that the virus is less likely to spread as rapidly in the UK due to younger people being more likely to be symptomless carriers. This could help to limit the spread of the virus in the UK.']",

1036,Coronavirus: Indian greeting namaste goes global,"['The global spread of coronavirus has seen India’s traditional greeting of Namaste take hold in other countries as a safe alternative to handshakes and hugs in an effort to avoid transmission of the virus.  The greeting, which essentially means ‘I bow to you’, involves the two people greeting each other with the palms of their hands pressed together in front of the chest, while bowing the head in respect.  This gesture is widely used in India to greet friends, strangers, and family as it is seen as a sign of respect and appreciation.  The National Indian American Association (NIAA) has taken this practice global, encouraging people to greet each other with Namaste during the pandemic.  Numerous celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey, former First Lady Michelle Obama, actor Dwayne Johnson and the Duchess of Sussex, have all been seen greeting people with Namaste.  The gesture has been widely welcomed as an effective way to avoid contact with other people in public, and it is hoped that Namaste will help reduce the spread of the virus.  The traditional Indian greeting of ‘Namaste’ has become a global greeting during the coronavirus pandemic. The idea of ‘Namaste’ is rooted in Hinduism and can be translated to mean ‘I bow to you’. It is often used as a way of showing respect and acknowledging the presence of another person.  As the world adapts and adjusts to the new reality of social distancing, many people are finding creative ways to show respect and kindness to one another despite the physical barriers between them. People are now using ‘Namaste’ when they greet one another from a distance, as a way to create a connection without any physical contact.  The symbol of ‘Namaste’ is a reminder that we are all connected, even though we might be apart physically. It is also a reminder to practice empathy despite circumstances, as well as to be kind, compassionate and understanding. This simple gesture is a reminder of the power of kindness and its ability to transcend all boundaries.']",
1037,Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US,"['The failure of the US to implement adequate testing has been attributed to several factors. First, the US initially did not prioritize creating a comprehensive testing strategy. This was due to a lack of clarity about the scope of the virus, and the strategy needed to contain it. Second, the US did not have an adequate supply of testing kits or supplies to perform the tests, and the manufacturing process of these tests was not adequately scaled up. Finally, the US was not adequately prepared to ensure proper tracking and tracing of individuals who had tested positive. These issues have hindered the US's efforts to contain the spread of the virus.  The United States has suffered from a number of failures in its initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including inadequate testing and contact tracing capabilities. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, the main reason for the failure of testing efforts comes down to “false comfort” and a lack of preparedness on the part of the US government.  In an interview with the Associated Press, Fauci blamed the US’s weak testing system on the government's decision to rely heavily on the private sector while failing to have its own federal resources in place in a timely manner. This led to a backlog of testing and a lack of coordination between different laboratories and medical facilities.  The US also failed to adopt the rigorous testing and contact tracing techniques used successfully in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, where the virus was contained in a matter of weeks. Fauci also criticized other countries for their failure to implement measures like social distancing and mask-wearing early on, saying that if these had been put in place, the US could have avoided the current crisis.  In addition to these issues, the US has been hampered by limited vaccine production and distribution, a shortage of test supplies, and a problem with testing accuracy.  The US has since made significant efforts to address its testing woes, setting up long-term plans and initiatives to increase testing capacity and improve coordination between laboratories. It has also been working with the private sector to develop more accurate tests and deploy them quickly.  However, despite these efforts, the US is still struggling to get its testing system in order. The country continues to be hampered by inadequate lab capacity, fewer testing centers, and supply chain issues, which have hindered efforts to contain the spread of the virus.']",

1046,Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"['No, female urinals are not likely to be the answer to queues at the loos. Although they could potentially reduce the need for more toilets, there are a variety of factors that could still result in queues, such as the size of the restroom, the number of available stalls, and the number of people attempting to access them at the same time. Additionally, the cost of installation and maintenance for the urinals could be prohibitive for some establishments.  No, female urinals are not the ideal solution to queues at the loos. While they do provide a space-saving option, they can be unhygienic and uncomfortable to use. In addition, they require a considerable amount of water to flush, and often require expensive plumbing modifications. A better approach may be to create more stalls and/or larger stalls to accommodate more people.  No, female urinals are not the answer to queues at the loos. While female urinals reduce the time it takes for an individual to use the bathroom, they are not necessarily the most sanitary option, as they can increase the risk of cross-contamination.

1047,How Europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail,"['When a terror offender is released from prison in Europe, a range of measures are taken to mitigate the risk posed by their release. These measures usually include a requirement to report regularly to the police, as well as prohibitions on travelling outside of the geographic region and restrictions on internet access. In some cases, offenders may also be required to take part in deradicalization or rehabilitation programmes. Some countries also have laws that allow for the continued detention of individuals deemed to be a threat, even after they have served their sentences.  When it comes to dealing with terror offenders who have been released from jail, European governments typically take a multi-pronged approach. This typically includes a range of measures, such as providing re-integration support and monitoring those released from prison, to ensure they are not returning to terrorist activity.  In some countries, such as in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, released offenders are subject to a range of restrictions that seek to manage the risk posed to the public. These restrictions may include curfews, electronic tagging, special reporting requirements, exclusion from certain neighborhoods or activities, and/or the requirement to follow certain rules of behavior.  In other countries, such as France and Germany, released offenders may be subject to closer monitoring by law enforcement authorities and/or civil society or rehabilitation programs. This monitoring may include regular contact with probation or police officers, supervised travel, participation in psychological therapy and/or job training.  In addition, some countries, such as France and Belgium, have established special units within their respective prison systems specifically to monitor and rehabilitate released terror offenders and ensure they are not returning to terrorist activities.  Overall, European governments are taking a range of measures to prevent released terror offenders from returning to terrorist activity.']",
1048,Ethiopia's Ambo city: 'From freedom to repression under Abiy Ahmed',"['Since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in Ethiopia in 2018, the city of Ambo has experienced a dramatic transformation. Under Abiy, Ambo has been hailed by many as a symbol of freedom and progress after years of political repression under the country’s former authoritarian leader, Meles Zenawi.   In the time since Abiy’s administration came to power, the city of Ambo has seen a blossoming of media freedom, with a range of new independent radio and television stations being established, including the popular Radio Ambo, which provides alternative news and local content.   The city has also become a major centre of economic activity, with investment from local and international companies, a growing number of hotels, and a large international university.   However, despite the progress Ambo has seen under Abiy’s rule, the city has also experienced increasing levels of political repression. In 2019, there were violent protests in the city sparked by a controversial move by the local authorities to transfer land to a private company. Security forces used force to quash the demonstrations, resulting in the deaths of several people and the displacement of hundreds of others.   Furthermore, in 2020 the government used a state of emergency to effectively take control of the city, severely limiting the activities of civil society organisations and independent media outlets. This has resulted in a significant curtailment of freedom of expression and a deterioration of civil rights in the city.   It is clear that while Ambo has made progress in some areas since Abiy came to power, it is still suffering from increasing levels of repression. Unless the government of Ethiopia makes serious efforts to protect freedom of expression and civil rights in the city, it is likely that Ambo will continue to experience a decline in democratic freedoms.']",
1049,Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"['The political chaos in Guinea-Bissau could open the door for increased drug trafficking in the West African country. The instability caused by a civil war and a longstanding power struggle between the government and the military has created a power vacuum that organized crime groups have moved to exploit. The country has become a major transit point for the trafficking of cocaine to Europe, and Guinea-Bissau has been identified by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cocaine smuggling.  The power vacuum in Guinea-Bissau has allowed organized crime groups to flourish and to gain control of some areas of the country, making it easier for them to move large shipments of cocaine. The lack of central government control has made it easier for traffickers to establish routes into Europe, as well as providing them with easier access to corrupt government officials who can facilitate their operations. The Guinea-Bissau political chaos has also made it difficult for law enforcement to effectively combat organized crime and the smuggling of drugs.   Organized crime groups from Latin America, especially Colombia and Brazil, have been identified as the main drivers behind the drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau. These groups are using the country to move drugs to Europe, taking advantage of both its weak controls and its strategic location. In addition, the trafficking of weapons and other illicit goods is also taking place in the country, adding to the instability.  The political chaos in Guinea-Bissau could pave the way for further cocaine smuggling, and the country could become even more of a transit hub if the current power vacuum is not addressed. The government must take steps to restore stability and strengthen the rule of law if it wants to stop the drug trafficking and bring an end to the chaos. Otherwise, Guinea-Bissau could become a hub for drug trafficking and other organized crime, putting the country and its citizens at risk.']",

1060,The Plot Against Americaâs vision feels eerily familiar,"[', in part because it draws on many of the same themes of fear of the other and oppressive debate that are seen in the modern political landscape. The show depicts a world in which a xenophobic, authoritarian leader is elected to the presidency, and fears of a totalitarian government arise. In his alternate history, President Lindbergh is a stand-in for Donald Trump, a man who openly flouts the norms of American democracy, stokes xenophobia and racism, and speaks of the nation with a kind of authoritarian mindset. The show stakes its claim as a warning of how easily a democracy can be taken over by a demagogue, and how quickly a nation's values can be pushed aside in favor of authoritarianism and fascism. It's a powerful, if frightening, portrait of a future America, and a wake-up call to stay vigilant in the face of escalating threats against our democracy. in its modern context. It illustrates the power of fear, prejudice, and populist rhetoric to shape public opinion and take advantage of people’s vulnerability and distrust of government. It paints a vivid picture of how dystopia can arise out of democracy, and how quickly it can arise. The novel also speaks to the current political climate in America, addressing issues of immigration and the rise of right-wing populism. It warns that allowing extremist voices to gain a foothold in a democracy can lead to disastrous consequences. It is an urgent warning for the present day, and a reminder of the need for strong civic engagement and government accountability.']",
