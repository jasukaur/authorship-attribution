25,why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses while its not exactly public health news that affects college campuses the impact of the virus on campus is being closely watched the cdc released a report this week to illustrate how much of the risk to college students comes from travel to places such as mexico this is the second year in a row that the cdc released a report on the virus previous estimates have put the impact at more than 5 billion so what are the potential effects some believe the higher level of risk is because the virus lingers in the air around the campus but another theory is the virus can persist in the environment such as the air conditioning units for instance the cdc believes that the virus can survive in the air for up to a week after exposure to the air and then dissipate other studies have also found the virus can linger for days or even weeks in the air in fact experts believe that the virus can live for up to six weeks when people are exposed to it however the cdc report said that since the virus is still circulating in the air near buildings people are still most likely to fall ill and so people should cover their mouth and nose when they come into contact with the virus however the cdc also notes that while other studies have found that the virus can linger in the air for a long time there is no way to tell how long the virus has lingered in the air so why the effects of the virus may be more severe on college campuses the cdc also recommends students not bring their school id to the school that means that students cant bring their school id and while students may not bring their school id because of the virus they may bring it with them to the school the cdc also says students should not bring their school id if they are sick because the virus can linger in the air for up to six weeks after exposure to the air the cdc also recommends that students take their school identification with them if a student is ill they should take their school id with them to a local hospital other school districts also have policies that limit the number of students per class when students are sick the cdc says students must be in school for at least three days before they can bring their school id the cdc suggests that students should take all necessary precautions to ensure their health,fair

696,how to improve your chances against coronavirus most people recover within two days and recover within three weeks but there can be serious complications there is no vaccine or treatment available for severe acute coronavirus and the only treatment is a course of antibiotics however many people recover quickly and are able to carry on with their lives even after the infection has ended anyone experiencing symptoms of the infection which can be lifethreatening should consult their gp most coronaviruses are spread by direct contact with an infected persons saliva or faeces  but most infections occur in the first five days after infection for people with severe symptoms the best course is to stay at home and visit their gp a typical coldlike illness is called a viral pneumonia the infection usually lasts around two hours the body can then recover without antibiotics and after that the infection is usually gone forever the main risk of contracting the virus in the first place is to the lungs and it can be extremely serious the virus can survive for up to a week but if it does not symptoms can develop very quickly dr brian mccloskey consultant in infectious diseases at nhs greater glasgow and clyde said the virus is spread by contact with saliva or faeces  but this can be a very serious illness it is extremely important to be aware of the symptoms of the virus and to seek medical advice if you develop any the best advice is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water stay away from your work or school and take your temperature at least one hour before you go to the toilet it is important to follow nhs advice and stay away from your gp practice for the rest of the day the latest figures show an increase in the number of people presenting to emergency departments in scotland for flulike symptoms experts say this type of flu which includes flulike symptoms is increasing at an alarming rate the number of people hospitalised with flulike symptoms now stands at 642  three times the number last winter figures from nhs 24 show the number of people admitted to each hospital with flulike symptoms has risen by almost half in the past week figures suggest the number of people in hospital following the flu outbreak in scotland rose by almost a fifth on the same period last year,fair

801,my argument with justice antonin scalia opinion the ruling was greeted by applause from both sides of the right even if it was interpreted by many to be a recognition that the individual mandate issue was settled but the case was significant too because it had the potential to affect a broader range of legal issues both for the individual and for the health care system todays ruling was significant because it reached a broader range of issues and reaffirmed the constitution republicans had argued that the mandate violated the american constitutions prohibition against unreasonable interference with the legislative branch the case was closely watched by conservatives because of the impact it could have on the legislative branch especially the house and senate the majority opinion noted that the mandate had to be unconstitutional to survive i was struck by the fact that the president argued that it was a constitutional right to impose a constitutional obligation on every individual to have preventive health care for him the mandate was a constitutional right but this was made clear in his previous statements on the constitution and was the result of the fact that the federal government was not compelled to recognize the laws requirement that all citizens buy insurance or pay a fine in the past liberal groups like the heritage foundation and the federalist society have argued that the federal government had abused its power by requiring individuals to have coverage now the administration has said the mandate is constitutional the case has also been a topic for discussion among some other judges in the court of appeals the justice department has a separate lawsuit pending against the mandate and has already reached settlements with some other groups including the new york times over the reporting of the mandate the issue is not the only one that will be addressed in the coming term of the court this term the other two cases will be decided on several occasions but they will be decided separately while the court of appeals will be more interested in this issue than the individual mandate case the justices see this as not a minor issue because the mandate is constitutional the president is asking the supreme court and the new york times to decide this case the new york times is hopeful that the court of appeals will agree with the new york times that the mandate is constitutional and that the individual mandate does not violate the federal constitutional ban on interference with legislative branch power the case is theodore olson v sebelius 13396,fair

881,with coronavirus its time to declare a national emergency  the new york times i was struck by this story last week about the decision by the united states department of agriculture to ban the use of chicken by poultry farms in the national salmonella outbreak many people are saying the decision is a political move  they are just trying to prevent an outbreak of salmonella an outbreaks of foodborne illnesses that are caused by campylobacter an organism that can be found in cooked chicken eggs and raw meat its time to declare a national emergency and its worth noting that there have been no reported cases in the united states linked to chicken raised in the chicken indeed the cdc has said that the decision was not linked to salmonella the problem however is that there appear to be large numbers of chicken farms with no oversight and because the outbreak only affects chicken raised in salmonellafree chickens it is not clear who is to blame the decision to ban the use of chicken by poultry farms is not a decision that is made lightly but it amounts to a political move by the government to prevent an outbreak of salmonella the cdc states that it is not currently aware of any reports of instances of salmonella from salmonella in chicken raised in chicken coops and that the cause of salmonella might be the inability to obtain chicken from chicken raised outside of the chicken coop thats not all while the public doesnt usually get sick from salmonella it can also become severely sickened from the bacteria which can cause diarrhea fever and abdominal pain its important for people to be aware of the risk of salmonella an estimated one in every 200 people who get sick from salmonella will die if youre sick with salmonella get the salmonella test done  youll find lots of foods that are especially harmful to your health the epa says chicken raised in the chicken coop should be destroyed the agency only recommends that chicken be thrown away and chicken farms will never be certified as unsafe but the epa says that if chicken is allowed in the chicken coop it should be kept out of the hands of children,fair

1047,how europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail and given a licence the parole board is responsible for setting parole rules but it does not grant licences for those convicted of terrorist offences or those who have already served their sentence if you had been convicted of a terrorist offence your sentence would have been shortened but you would still have been considered for parole this is because the parole board relies on a number of factors to decide whether someone should be released including the risk that they will commit another crime or be rereleased again the boards decision is final but it is inconsistent with the human rights act which allows judges to overturn decisions made by the parole board this was the case when adel abdel aziz was sentenced to life for his part in the 1998 bombings of us embassies in tanzania and kenya following his trial the attorney general lord goldsmith found that the police had acted lawfully by shooting the accused when the shooting was believed to be an act of selfdefence he added that the shooting may have gone entirely unjustified but had fallen well short of his personal view this led to the most revulsion in the west and led to many politicians and human rights lawyers to demand that the decision be overturned the legal advice of the government is that if the parole board were to reject a prisoners application for release it would be in breach of the european convention on human rights which protects freedom of expression and would in effect constitute a breach of article 3 of the privacy and civil liberties cantor convention and constitute a breach of the european convention on human rights a further complication arose when the european court of human rights found that the european arrest warrant eaw was unlawful the eaw was introduced in december 1999 and was intended to protect uk citizens freedom of expression but it has been criticised for being outdated it was widely assumed that the home secretary theresa may intended to introduce a new version of the eaw in the wake of the 9  11 attacks any attempt to change it has been strongly opposed by senior politicians we are not surprised by the decision to change the law in this case more than 130 men were convicted of terrorism,fair

1062,how do you keep a space station clean the astronauts aboard the international space station iss were able to have their space suits clean with a couple of simple simple moves  they placed a sheet over the surface of the water to protect the clothing when the suit was cooled by the isss module astronauts had to wear it for five days straight the crews helmet is made of synthetic fibres and the space suit has three carbon composite panels on display a video of the astronauts laundry was released by the iss this week and it shows them cleaning the module and the cooling system before the suit is placed inside the protective suit the iss provides a great deal of moisture for astronauts to use in space however nasa explains that the crew may opt to wash their suits with a shower once the suits are released into the atmosphere the astronauts are forced to wear gloves or wash their hands before they shower this is because if the gloves are wet the water is not enough to cover the fabric however the astronauts have their masks drawn and their clothes washed regularly when they get wet the suits are very dirty but the astronauts have their hands washed they are also able to cool their suits by spritzing them with cold water this solution is one of the most common household gadgets aboard the iss a shower can be used to warm up a space suit before being put into space the shower can be used to wash a suit before being put into space the shower can be used to cool a space suit before being put into space all of this is done from the comfort of orbit nasa explains it is not just about being able to use a shower a shower can be used to cool a space suit before being put into space this is the only way to remove oil it is also effective when the suit is in use not only do the astronauts know how to use the shower but they also know how to use it the crew is also able to use the shower to clean the suits before it is placed in the protective suit its kind of like a glove astronaut sunita williams said when nasa released this video it doesnt have to be in a tight spot to be effective its sort of like a big bag of rubbish,fair
