73,is dna the key to protecting earths tallest species is dna the key to protecting earths tallest species while dna is not the sole determinant of species survival it does play an important role studies have shown that genetic diversity is key to the survival of many tall species such as the giant panda and the giraffe more diversity translates to a greater likelihood of overcoming obstacles and adapting to changing conditions by preserving and protecting the genetic diversity of tall species we can help ensure their longterm survival  there is no definitive answer but it is thought that the preservation of genetic diversity is the key to protecting earths tallest speciesdna is the genetic information that creates the characteristics of an individual organism and it is this information that is most vulnerable to damage and loss if a species genetic diversity is reduced there is a greater chance that the species will go extinct  one of the best ways to protect earths tallest species is to keep their populations healthy since it is taller species that are more likely to dominate their environments by understanding the genetic information of earths tallest species we can better conserve and protect them  there is no one answer to this question as different species would have to be looked at in different ways to see if dna was the key to their conservation some scientists may look at the genetic diversity of a species to see if there are any areas where the different populations could be split and if so whether protecting these areas with dna conservation could help to keep the populations separate others may look at the geographical distribution of a species to see if any protected areas could be created to help protect their habitat ultimately the answer to this question would vary depending on the specific species and where it is located,gpt3

216,a trade deal with america will not compensate britain for the loss of eu benefits a trade deal with america will not compensate britain for the loss of eu benefits this is not an accurate representation of the position of the uk government the uk has been clear that it wants a trade deal with america that is equivalent in value to the benefits the uk gets from membership of the eu this will not be easy to achieve but it is something the uk is determined to achieve  there is no one trade deal with america  different agreements will be in place for different sectors of the economy britain will lose out on the benefits of access to the eus single market but could benefit from more favourable trade deals with other countries  there is no guarantee that a trade deal with america will compensate britain for the loss of eu benefits while a trade deal with america could be beneficial in some ways it is likely that it would also result in the loss of many of the benefits that britain currently receives from the eu for example a trade deal with america could mean that britain would no longer have access to the eus free trade area which would result in significant losses for the uk economy  this claim is false  if the uk did not join the eu it would still be able to trade with america and receive the same benefits as it does now from the eu for example british citizens would still be able to live and work in america and the uk would continue to be part of the eus single market and customs union,gpt3

223,our connected world made coronavirus spread it may also be what saves us from it our connected world made coronavirus spread it may also be what saves us from it   since 2006 coronavirus has been diagnosed in humans nearly every year with a range of severity the virus is highly contagious and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses including pneumonia  despite the annual outbreaks coronavirus never mutated beyond a form that could be easily spread through coughing and sneezing but in september 2017 a new form of coronavirus emerged that could spread through close contact such as touching hands or sharing cups or straws  this new form of coronavirus was first identified in saudi arabia and quickly spread to other countries in the middle east europe and asia sudden onset of severe respiratory illness including pneumonia and even meningitis has resulted in large numbers of deaths  however the new form of coronavirus has not yet spread beyond a handful of cases and has not been found to cause any more fatalities than the older more common form of the virus  this may be because the new form of the virus is less contagious than the older form for example people who are infected with the new form of coronavirus are only two to eight times as likely to spread the virus to others as those who are infected with the older form of the virus  the new form of coronavirus also seems to be less lethal than the older form probably because it does not cause as much severe respiratory illness  this is good news because it may mean that the new form of coronavirus can be stopped from spreading more widely by simply preventing people from getting infected with it  so far the new form of coronavirus has not been found to cause any more fatalities than the older form this is good news because it may mean that the new form of coronavirus can be stopped from spreading more widely by simply preventing people from getting infected with it  the interconnected world we live in has made it easier for the new form of coronavirus to spread it is possible that the new form of coronavirus is less deadly because it does not cause as much severe respiratory illness  if this is the case then the interconnected world may be what saves us from the virus becoming more dangerous,gpt3

419,your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk widespread media coverage of the obesity epidemic has led to an increased focus on waist size and its relation to heart disease risk however research has shown that weight is more important than waist size when it comes to predicting heart disease risk  your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk a study published in the journal circulation found that men who have a waist size greater than 33 inches 84 cm and women who have a waist size greater than 26 inches 66 cm are at a greater risk of having a heart attack  a study by the european society of cardiology found that people with a waist size greater than 33 inches had a threefold increased risk of heart attack compared to those with a waist size of 23 inches or less the study also found that people with a waist size greater than 37 inches had a sixfold increased risk of heart attack    this is a controversial topic some studies suggest that waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk other studies say that weight is more important  thats a surprising statement but there is some evidence that your waist size may be more important than your weight for multiple heart attack risk  multiple heart attacks are caused by the buildup of blood clots in the arteries of the heart the heavier you are the more likely it is that you will have these clots however research has shown that your waist size is a better predictor of heart attack risk than your weight  one study found that people who had a waist size above 37 inches 94 cm were two times as likely to have a heart attack than people with a waist size below 26 inches 66 cm and a study published in the journal of the american college of cardiology found that people who had a waist size of greater than 40 inches 102 cm were three times as likely to have a heart attack as people with a waist size of less than 32 inches 81 cm  so it appears that your waist size is more important than your weight for multiple heart attack risk if you are worried about your risk of heart disease it is important to be mindful of your waist size and to make lifestyle changes if needed to lower your risk,gpt3

715,confronting the cult of partisan media confronting the cult of partisan media there is no doubt that partisanship has taken on a life of its own in the united states political partisanship has become so entrenched and pervasive that it has largely taken over from the objective reporting and analysis that used to be the norm in american journalism  this problem is not limited to american journalism the problem of partisan media is global  the ideological division that has developed in the united states over the past several years is not a new phenomenon it first emerged during the heated debates over the iraq war at that time the bush administration was aggressively promoting the war while many of its domestic critics were vehemently opposed  as a result the mainstream media was almost entirely committed to reporting the news in a way that served the administrations agenda this pattern was repeated during the presidential race between barack obama and mitt romney  during both campaigns the media coverage was dominated by stories about the candidates speeches their policies and their alliances with other politicians very little attention was given to the policies that either candidate was proposing or to the concrete proposals that they had put forward for reform  the result was that the public had a very limited understanding of the candidates proposals and little idea of the choices that they were making  this problem is aggravated by the fact that the major media outlets are owned by large corporations that are motivated primarily by their own profits these corporations are often reluctant to challenge the interests of their corporate clients or to take a stand on controversial issues  as a result the media is increasingly dominated by a tiny number of wealthy individuals and corporate interests this concentration of power has produced a media system that is biased in favor of the interests of the american elites  in addition the rise of the internet has made it easier for individuals to get their own independent sources of news and information this has created a new generation of americans who are completely ignorant of the political and economic realities of the world beyond the united states  these trends have created a serious obstacle to the growth of democracy in the united states they have also made it difficult for the public to have an informed discussion about the important issues of the day  there is no easy solution to the problem of partisan media but there are a number of things that can be done to address the problem,gpt3

798,an online generation redefines mourning an online generation redefines mourning i vividly remember the first time i ever heard the word bullying it was in the context of a conversation i was having with a close friend about someone who we knew our conversation turned to how we thought that person should have responded to the bullying our discussion soon turned to how we ourselves had been bullied as children we shared stories of how we had been made to feel ashamed or embarrassed and how it had affected our selfconfidence and overall wellbeing  at the time i couldnt have put into words how much this conversation resonated with me it was probably because i had been through something similar myself the thing is i wasnt the only one  since then ive come to learn that bullying is not just a playground gossip topic exclusive to school children its an issue that affects people of all ages and intersects with a whole range of social emotional and physical issues in fact many experts believe that bullying is a major factor in the development of chronic mental health problems like anxiety depression and substance abuse  so what does this mean for the victims of bullying  it means that we need to be more aware and sensitive to the experiences of those who are victims of bullying in addition we need to find ways to support and protect these individuals from the harmful and corrosive effects of bullying  fortunately there are many ways that we can start to address this issue for example we can create a positive school climate that is supportive and safe for all students we can also promote antibullying policies and initiatives across all levels of society and last but not least we can provide support and resources to victims of bullying so that they can rebuild their lives,gpt3

810,how outrage over cecil killing misses the point how outrage over cecil killing misses the point the killing of cecil the lion by an american hunter has caused an outcry amongst many people his death has been used as an example of how poaching is the cause of the decline of big game populations and has reignited the debate about hunting however the outrage over cecil misses the point  the reason why big game populations are declining is not because of poaching but because of habitat loss and degradation poaching is a symptom not the cause of these problems if we want to reverse the decline of big game populations we need to address the underlying causes    the outrage over cecils death misses the point it seems people are more upset about the fact that he was killed than the manner in which he was killed  the killing of cecil the lion has generated a great deal of outrage in the uk and elsewhere this anger is warranted but it may be missing the point  the lion was killed by an american hunter walter palmer who paid 55000 to kill the animal the hunter was apparently trying to kill a male lion but cecil was a female the killing has generated a great deal of criticism both in the uk and abroad because of the animals status as a lion  palmer has since been fined 3000 by zimbabwes national park authority and his hunting license has been suspended he is also the subject of a criminal investigation  the issue here is not the killing of cecil but the way the hunter killed cecil the lion was shot with an arrow from a hunting rifle something that is not allowed in zimbabwe the killing of cecil has raised questions about the validity of hunting permits in the country and the way that palmer was able to kill cecil without proper authorization  the outrage over cecils death may be misplaced in that it is focusing on the wrong issue the important question is how palmer was able to kill cecil without proper authorization and how this could lead to illegal hunting in zimbabwe,gpt3

922,opinion  its a maga microbe meltdown opinion  its a maga microbe meltdown we all know the story by now after donald trump won the election some of his supporters started believing that anything is possible and anything goes this included the idea that the election was a rigged campaign and that trump is a genius  now as we all know this has completely backfired on trump and his supporters the rigged accusation has been debunked and trumps approval ratings have plummeted as a result  but the real disaster is the rampant thinking among trumps supporters that anything goes including the idea that trump is a genius  this mentality has led to a maga microbe meltdown in which conservatives and other trump supporters are starting to criticize trumps policies and statements even more harshly than usual  this is not only causing trumps approval ratings to decline even further but also emboldening his critics and leading to a wave of criticism of trumps policies from the entire political spectrum  this maga microbe meltdown is completely unnecessary and its causing a lot of damage to trump and his supporters we need to stop it before it becomes irreversible  its a maga microbe meltdown  the best way to describe the current state of the us government is a maga microbe meltdown  the trump administration is embroiled in multiple scandals including the now infamous russian collusion investigation the president has attacked his own attorney general threatened to fire special counsel robert mueller insulted the judiciary and insulted journalists and the intelligence community  meanwhile the government is in total chaos top officials are resigning left and right and there are reports of rampant infighting and chaos  this is certainly not the norm for a successful government and it is clearly having a negative impact on both the american people and the trump administration itself  the maga microbe meltdown is a dangerous situation that urgently needs to be corrected,gpt3
923,opinion  lets move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses opinion  lets move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses we need to move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses this will help reduce the number of nonviolent offenders being incarcerated which will in turn reduce crime rates  the criminal justice system is broken and it needs to be fixed unfortunately many solutions require a change in policy or law and those changes are often difficult to achieve one potential solution is to move all criminal courts online this would eliminate the need for people to go to court and it would cut down on the amount of time and money that people spend in the criminal justice system  suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would also help to reduce the amount of time that people spend in the criminal justice system currently people who are accused of nonviolent offenses are almost always granted bail this means that they are released from jail while they await their trial which can add a lot of pressure and stress to their lives suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would mean that people who are accused of these crimes would remain in jail until their trial which would make them less likely to commit crimes and more likely to be treated fairly  in recent years courts have been moving towards online court filings hearings and judgments this move is in line with the trend of more efficient and automated systems which is good for defendants and the court system however there is one exception to this trend bail  as it stands the bail process is an outdated and needlessly burdensome procedure that often unfairly punishes nonviolent offenders bail is a punishment that should only be used in cases of extreme danger to the community or the trial participant not for minor offenses  in light of this it is important to move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses this would reduce the number of people who are stuck in jail because they cant afford to pay bail and it would improve the fairness and efficiency of the court system,gpt3

928,opinion  we need to flatten the curve trump and fox are behind it opinion  we need to flatten the curve trump and fox are behind it when the trump administration released its fiscal year 2019 budget proposal last month one of the key proposals was the idea of flattening the us income tax curve the proposal would lower the top income tax bracket from 396 to 33 and the bottom income tax bracket from 10 to zero  the theory behind this proposal is that by reducing the income tax rates businesses and individuals will have more money to spend and create jobs  there is a lot of evidence to support the idea that lower income tax rates are good for the economy for example when the top tax bracket was lowered from 70 to 396 in 1986 the economy grew by an estimated 85  the trump administration is right to propose this measure the us tax system is already very progressive and the top income tax rate is higher than in most other developed countries its time to flatten the curve and make the us tax system more competitive  donald trump and rupert murdoch are pushing for an immigration policy that would drastically reduce the number of people coming into the united states this would have a negative impact on many workingclass and lowincome families and would contradict trumps previous promises to protect these groups  the trump administration is promoting a flatten the curve immigration policy that would reduce the number of people coming into the country by 50 percent this policy would have a negative impact on many workingclass and lowincome families and would contradict trumps previous promises to protect these groups  the flatten the curve approach would decrease the number of people coming into the united states by eliminating the diversity visa lottery increasing the number of required visas for familybased visas and limiting the number of refugees admitted each year this would have a particularly negative impact on lowincome and workingclass families who are more likely to be dependent on immigration for their livelihood  trump and murdoch are pushing for this extreme immigration policy because it is consistent with their own interests trump benefits from reducing the number of people coming into the united states because it would make it more difficult for lowincome and workingclass families to find a way to live in the united states murdoch benefits from reducing the number of people coming into the united states because it would make it more difficult for new competitors to enter the television and media markets  we need to stand up to trump and murdoch and fight for an immigration policy that is progressive inclusive and fair we need to continue to advocate for dreamers undocumented immigrants who have been living in the united states for years and for a policy that welcomes immigrants and refugees we need to flatten the curve and fight for a policy that benefits all of us,gpt3
