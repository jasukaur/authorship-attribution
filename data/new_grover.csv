189,the truth about the white working class the truth about the white working class by natalia reyes and kate gavinnwe are under the gun to demonstrate at the beijing olympic closing ceremony how the socalled white working class has been linked to a significant influence on politics after all the wh has always been the campaign to give the elite a voice in the debate of american politics and to do this in a predominately white race that has historically been resistant to promoting its own voice has come across as an encouraging project of corporate americanit does not make a difference how this socalled white working class has come to be portrayed to the nationnthe white working class that we have been talking about for years is largely composed of white progressives whose battle to oppose the tea party in the large cities what many call the mockery of america was perceived to be as a rejection of white middleclass middleclass voting patterns labor quotas and small business policies as such these were the foundations of the tea party insurgency but not because the party had now turned off traditional voting patternsnbut the problem in this economic climate has to do with its increasingly small states because like the land of the open road in california they have few commercial landowners or jobs available to provide for their populationsnthree small states  arizona colorado and nevada  now have such huge middleclass populations they are the most populous of the large states and the fourthlargest in the nation at approximately 14 million these states are roughly 16 of the nations population if you include a very small population of hispanicsnbut while the white working class stands shoulder to shoulder with these states it is the massive concentration of white racial elites from the reaganlike top of the hill era along with their small and mediumsized majority blacklatino population that are claiming power to western capitalist nations while the lone white working class is becoming a menace to american capitalist democracy they do so using socialized medicine and the price of their natural resources is higherincome jobs and a national debt which has been swollen by white wealthnthe point of this country at least insofar as it is involved in this nations economy is not that its interests should prevail over the interests of whites what concerns it in this decision was that the most directly affected and affected by the metoo movement under the auspices of the republican party in america is a perception by white liberals of societal evil ie a recognition that the culture and ways that facilitated systemic racism have not been challenged and it is completely unacceptable for people who are considered irrelevant and insignificant in the lives of white people to be denied the same equal rights as everyone elsenit is understandable that many whites are waiting and in many cases willing and able to respond if victims of sexual abuse by their employers lies and teachings on the internet and one thing they can expect is justice but there are no excuses for past injustices and reprehensible practices or the ugliness of political discourse but racism in a pluralistic society like ours takes on extraordinary levels and is totally out of touch with the american way of livingnwe can go on to prove beyond doubt that the ancient guilt at the original white working class through the misrepresentation of its culture and beliefs is capable of reinventing itself in a healthy manner to meet the local needs of its population the philosophy of wallace r perkins  have one law but have two  can help usher in this new age our collective culture and the economy is finding itself in the midst of something more significantn,grover

815,the marriage apocalypse may be coming opinion the marriage apocalypse may be coming opinion so what is the state of society and the marriage system that is supposed to be more effective as a more confident society i believe the answer would be good marriagenyour marriage system has always needed the same tools as it did at the time you were a young widow as a stillborn child you could put your mind to a variety of travails and keep doing what you wanted to do it was a pleasure to use ones free will to attempt to save yourself and not for financial gain but to create bonds based on value and happiness that could continue to allow you to marry in a meaningful and loving wayni dont believe that you can go back to your old ways but i hope youve learned a valuable lesson in how not to tell a man how you cant marry and dont give up on the good things in your life that you already have for example if he had been divorced or he lost his job what type of relationships would you choose to take with you in this day and age would you give yourself the little moments of happiness that you have already lost or would you instead take the step of taking a better look of course you wouldnif you are writing this it may not be your fault if it happened to you i think all those who had the misfortune to hurt others dont know how to get their relationship back if you did it was your fault i know of no model for redefining the marriage system to allow other people to define the freedom they have to live happily together without massive amounts of responsibility for their relationships and because ones own romance and emotion are just as valuable as ones own potential you owe it to others to take care of themnit is important to distinguish between the people in these marriages and the ones in the union you need to look at the gender of each individual as the reason for their independence because a relationship is not created for every pair but it must always be allowed to function for that individual to havenmarriage is also about growth and change in relationships for one human being is a last resort you cant ask for an invitation to grow more deeply you cant bring in so many people to save you and while i dont think you could simply dismantle marriage you do have to find ways to make it better for your marriagenbut if your marriage is good how could you let yourself feel unhappy frustrated or broke with your spouses perhaps you chose the more normal one the more difficulty you could find in marriage and the additional stress it puts on you or may not be able to maintain enough tension for you to stay together how can you provide that stabilitynbut dont let your marriages teach you a lesson try to find each of those moments where for some reason you have to find a way to strike out only to regret it later once the bad loves are settled down the good ones can live happily together for a number of reasons divorcees get to continue to go to therapy less children are raised and you work at attaining themnsometimes you even are willing to cut out your familys ties is your marriage system the result of a breakdown of communication that is now becoming a rarity it is tough to endure when our marriages are broken up not only have you not been able to get along as a couple but at the same time you have reorganized yourselves to get closer and closer to your goalsnall relationships are good two manwoman marriages are good but marriage and family relationships are good toonyour marriage wont last forever there will always be ways to manipulate relationships to give you more control but the best strategy is to recognize that it may not be what you want to see for your marriage or family and perhaps even soonern,grover
