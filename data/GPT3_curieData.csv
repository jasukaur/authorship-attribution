1,China wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak,"['Beijing wants to take a victory lap over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, as the death toll from the disease has now fallen below 100, according to reports.  Since the outbreak began in November, the Chinese government has responded swiftly and efficiently, with hospitals rolling out guidelines and communication campaigns to help the public while limiting the spread of the virus.  And despite the recent death of a child, the country’s overall coronavirus death toll stands at just under 100, which is markedly lower than the global total of more than 10,000.  “The Chinese have done a really good job,” Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on a call.  However, Frieden warned that there is still much work to be done, as the outbreak continues to spread to new countries.  “This is not over yet,” he said., but will have to reckon with a number of challenges ahead.  The Chinese government has been applauded for its response to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people since early October.  But experts say the Chinese health care system is not well equipped to deal with a major outbreak, and the country’s sprawling and crowded cities are rife with places where people can easily spread the virus.  And even if China manages to contain the outbreak, experts say the country’s economic growth and burgeoning middle class will mean that the virus will continue to spread.  “China is one of the economies that has really come to the fore in recent years,” said James Hardy, an infectious diseases specialist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It’s become an economic powerhouse. It’s very much a country of opportunity, so the virus will continue to spread.”  China’s response  China’s response to the coronavirus has been widely praised, with state media lauding the country’s “fast and effective” response.  China has set up Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-style facilities in five provinces: Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan. Five other provinces have set up similar facilities, and the Ministry of Health is providing support to other provinces.  Experts say the Chinese response is impressive.  “China has done a really good job in setting up these centers,” Hardy said.  Chinese officials have also been quick to publicize the country’s successes.  In early December, the Ministry of Health released a report that said China had killed all of the coronavirus patients. The report gave no indication of how many patients had died after being treated at the Chinese facilities.  But experts say the report is likely to be misleading.  “The ministry is putting out a good headline, but the data behind it isn’t very reliable,” Hardy said.  Chinese officials have also claimed that the country’s hospitals have successfully treated all of the patients who have contracted the virus.  But experts say that’s not always the case']",
2,Coronavirus disinformation creates challenges for China's government,"[', health sector  As the global pandemic of coronavirus (CoV) gains momentum, China is facing mounting challenges from misinformation and disinformation. CoV is a member of the family of viruses that cause SARS, a global pandemic that killed more than a thousand people in 2003.  Since the CoV pandemic began in February 2019, the Chinese government has been struggling to control the spread of misinformation. In a report released on 9 April 2019, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) warned that the spread of disinformation and false news about CoV is hampering the government's efforts to respond to the pandemic.  According to the report, the Chinese media is playing an important role in fuelling the spread of disinformation. In particular, the online community has played a major role in spreading false information about CoV. In some cases, false information has been deliberately fabricated to mislead communities and instill fear.  At the same time, the Chinese health sector is facing challenges from misinformation and disinformation. In particular, the government has been struggling to control the spread of rumours about CoV among health workers.  As a result, the government has been forced to launch a number of public awareness campaigns to debunk misinformation. These campaigns have been successful in reducing the spread of false information, but they have also generated a lot of backlash among the public.  In addition, the Chinese health sector is struggling to deal with the influx of patients infected with CoV. In response to the increasing number of cases, the health ministry has been recruiting more doctors and nurses to deal with the pandemic. However, the government is also struggling to recruit enough medical personnel to deal with the high number of CoV cases.  The spread of misinformation and disinformation about CoV is hampering China's government, health sector and overall response to the pandemic. In order to counter these challenges, the Chinese government will need to make a concerted effort to control the spread of disinformation and implement public awareness campaigns that are designed to engage the public.']",
3,China coronavirus: Eating wild animals made illegal but ending the trade won't be easy,"['There have been sporadic cases of the coronavirus in China over the past year, but the virus has not yet caused any fatalities. The China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned citizens about the risk of contracting the virus from wild animals, and between June and September 2017, officials located and destroyed more than 20,000 wild animal carcasses suspected of containing the virus.  However, it’s difficult to enforce bans on hunting and consuming wild animals, especially in rural areas where these activities are often enjoyed by the locals. In addition, the illegal trade in wild animals is likely to continue, regardless of any new regulations. As a result, ending the trade in wild animals will not be easy.  Aug 3, 2019 by BBC  The Chinese government has announced that it is making eating wild animals illegal, following a public outcry over the spread of a coronavirus. But ending the trade in these animals is not going to be easy.  Monday, Jun 20, 2019  Melbourne (AFP) - Eating wild animals is now illegal in China, but ending the trade in these animals is not going to be easy, experts say.  The country banned hunting and capturing wild animals including venison, boar, rabbit and pheasant earlier this year as part of efforts to prevent the coronavirus, which has killed dozens of people in the country.  But those caught hunting or illegally trading in these animals can face heavy fines, jail time or both.  ""Anyone caught hunting or trapping wild animals could be fined up to 200,000 yuan (28,000 US dollars) and face up to two years in jail,"" said Chen Weidong, an expert on wildlife management at the Beijing-based WildLife Research Institute.  ""It's going to be very difficult to end the trade in wild animals as there are a lot of people involved,"" he added.  ""Law enforcement is going to need to be stepped up and more resources put into enforcement. If it's done slowly and gradually, it's possible it could be done, but it's going to be very difficult.""  China has been struggling to contain the virus since it first emerged earlier this year, with dozens of people diagnosed with the virus and a number of fatalities.

4,China's economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus,"['The Chinese economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus, according to a report by the International Monetary Fund. The virus has killed more than 1,000 people in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain and is believed to be causing respiratory illnesses there. The IMF warns that the economies of those countries could be stunted, as well as other countries in the region. Chinese exports to the three countries could shrink by around 10% due to the virus, the IMF said., the country's top economic planner said Wednesday.  The economy could contract by up to 3 percent this year and by another 1 or 2 percent in 2016 if the coronavirus continues to spread, said Deputy Premier Zhu Guangyao.  ""The Chinese economy is not just based on the growth of exports and investment, but also domestic consumption,"" Zhu said in a speech in Beijing. ""If the consumption side suffers a setback, the growth of exports and investment will also decline.""  Zhu said the Chinese government was taking ""all possible measures"" to contain the virus, which has caused a global health emergency.  The deputy premier's comments are the first time a senior government official has publicly warned of the possible economic consequences of the coronavirus.  The World Health Organization has said the virus could cause up to $5 billion in economic losses this year, and more if the virus spreads to other countries.  Zhu's comments suggest that Beijing is already taking the economic risks of a pandemic into account as it plans its response.  China has been a top donor of medical aid to the WHO and has dispatched teams of health experts to help contain the virus.  The Chinese government has also said it will provide financial aid to people affected by the virus.  Zhu's comments come as the WHO issues an update on the global response to the pandemic.  The WHO says the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus has reached 10,000, with more than 4,000 people dead.  The WHO is urging countries to ramp up their response to the pandemic and has called for more funding to help fight it.']",
5,China and Japan's budding relationship in the time of coronavirus,"['pandemic  9 August 2016  China and Japan's burgeoning relationship in the time of coronavirus pandemic    In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, China has been one of Japan's most important bilateral partners. Close economic ties, enhanced cooperation on public health, and a shared concern for global security have helped create a strong relationship.  There has been cooperation on a number of fronts. For example, Chinese and Japanese medical teams were the first to respond to the pandemic. And both countries have sent humanitarian aid to Saudi Arabia and the United States. In addition, there has been a notable increase in trade, with China now Japan's largest trading partner.  There has also been cooperation on regional issues. For example, Beijing has vigorously supported Tokyo's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. And both countries have worked together to resolve territorial disputes in the East China Sea.  In the light of the pandemic, the two countries have also strengthened cooperation on counter-terrorism. China has been a key partner in the coalition against the Islamic State, and has provided support for the deployment of Japanese troops in Iraq and Syria.  In the future, the two countries will continue to work together to promote regional peace and security, and to address global challenges such as climate change.  China and Japan have been close economic partners for many years and share a complex history. Their relationship has been marked by periods of tension and cooperation, but has generally been stable. The current outbreak of the coronavirus has tested China's responsiveness to international crises and shown the importance of China's role in the global response to the virus. At the same time, there are concerns that China's rapidly growing economy may divert resources from efforts to prevent the virus from spreading more widely, and that China's military ambitions could complicate relations with other countries in the region.']",
6,Coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic',"['A report published in the journal The Lancet last month has warned that coronavirus is fast becoming an 'economic pandemic' as the costs of treating patients increase and economies feel the pinch.  The report, entitled 'A global economic analysis of coronavirus disease': prepared by the Lancet Commission on Economic Risk Assessment, found that the cost of managing patients with coronavirus increases rapidly with severity of the condition, with a per patient cost of $34,000 for patients in the most severe category.  'This is an alarming development as the impact of this virus on economies is already being felt,' said Professor Keiji Fukuda, chair of the commission and head of the division of global health at Jichi Medical University in Japan.  'Worldwide, the economic cost of coronavirus is estimated to be US$22.5 billion and is expected to grow to US$44.9 billion by 2021,' the report added.  While coronavirus disease is most commonly associated with severe respiratory illness in humans, there is now clear evidence that the virus can also cause significant economic losses – through work absenteeism, loss of productivity, and other costs – in both developed and developing countries.  'The impact of coronavirus on economies is already being felt,' said Professor Keiji Fukuda, chair of the commission and head of the division of global health at Jichi Medical University in Japan.  The coronavirus is fast becoming an “economic pandemic”, with mounting costs and disruption to economies around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.  The virus is responsible for severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, and has killed more than 3,500 people since September 2013.  Last month, the WHO said the pandemic was expected to cost global economies up to $240 billion by 2020.  And this week, the organization said the virus was now also “spreading rapidly through human populations”, with new cases reported in 23 countries.  “This is an economic pandemic,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.  “We are seeing costs increase – in terms of health care, loss of productivity, and disruptions to economies – as well as large impacts on social and human security.”  The WHO said it was continuing to provide support to countries hit hardest by the pandemic, including by funding research into new vaccines and treatments.  It added that the global response to the virus had been “far too slow”, and called for a “systematic” approach to combatting the virus.']",
7,"A history of Wuhan, one-time Chinese capital and coronavirus epicenter","['Wuhan was a Chinese capital for over a thousand years. It became the focal point of a spread of the SARS coronavirus in 2003, and remained an epicenter for the epidemic until it was largely contained in spring 2004. The city was also the site of some of the earliest research into the virus.  Wuhan, formerly known as Wuchang, is the capital of Hubei Province and the most populous city in Central China. Established in 316 BC, it has been one of the most important political and cultural centres in China, and was the country's first capital.  On 27 May 2019, Wuhan was declared as the epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus epidemic. As of 11 July 2019, a total of 148 cases with 38 fatalities had been reported from the city. The global health community has intensified its response to the virus in Wuhan, deploying additional teams of experts and resources to support the city's response.  Wuhan, once the capital of China, is now a major epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic. Wuhan has a long and complex history, which is highlighted by its pivotal role in the development of Chinese civilization.  The city of Wuhan was first founded in the 7th century BCE by the Zhou dynasty. It became the capital of China during the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE). Wuhan was the center of Chinese culture and learning, and played a significant role in the development of Chinese civilization.  During the Communist Revolution in 1949, Wuhan was the site of major fighting between the Communist forces and the Nationalist forces. Wuhan was later renamed Hubei and became the capital of the newly created Hubei Province.  The Wuhan Incident, also known as the Wuhan Purge, occurred in 1957 when the Communist Party of China (CPC) carried out a counter-coup against the Nationalist Party of China (NPC). Thousands of people were killed or imprisoned as a result of the Wuhan Incident.  In recent years, Wuhan has experienced a significant growth in its economy. The city is now a major transportation hub, and has become a major tourist destination. Wuhan is also a key center for the development of the Chinese internet and technology industries.  The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak began in December 2013. As of September 2017, there have been over 1,000 cases of the virus reported in Wuhan and surrounding areas. The majority of the cases have been in patients who are elderly or have medical conditions that make them vulnerable to illness. The Wuhan outbreak has been complicated by the fact that many of the patients have not been able to communicate their symptoms to health officials.  The Wuhan outbreak has had a major impact on the city and its population. Many businesses have closed down, and the city has seen a significant decline in tourism. The outbreak has also had a major impact on the health of the residents of Wuhan. Many older residents have become very sick, and a number of them have died as a result of the virus.']",

9,Chinese diplomat promotes conspiracy theory that US military brought virus to Wuhan,"['On Nov. 12, a Chinese diplomat posted a conspiracy theory on his Weibo account that the US military had brought the H7N9 virus to Wuhan. The post quickly garnered attention and was shared over 1,000 times.  According to the post, the US military had purposefully brought the virus to Wuhan in order to create a global pandemic. The diplomat claimed that the US government was complicit in the virus’s spread and was using it as a pretext to wage war on China.  The post has been widely denounced as inaccurate and malicious. It has also sparked public outrage and calls for the diplomat to be held accountable.  On July 28, a Chinese diplomat posted a video on Weibo accusing the United States of intentionally spreading a virus in Wuhan. The video, which has been deleted, alleges that the virus was deliberately released in order to weaken China.  The diplomat, who identified himself only as ""Zou Bin,"" said that he had spoken to medical personnel who had found ""telltale signs"" of the US Military's intentional release of the virus. He went on to claim that the US was using the virus as an excuse to invade China.  China has been on high alert for any possible pandemic following a rash of major outbreaks in other parts of the world. The country has repeatedly warned its citizens about the dangers of the virus and urged them to maintain strict hygiene measures.  There is no evidence to support the claims made in the video. Wuhan was hit by a major outbreak of the H7N9 virus in February, but no evidence has emerged to suggest that the disease was caused by American forces.']",

Trump is struggling to keep up because he is not as good at manipulating the emotions of the public.  On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the coronavirus, which has killed more than 30 people in the Middle East and Africa. The virus has also become a major public health threat in the West, where it has killed 11 people and caused more than 150 NHS hospitalisations.

On Wednesday, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the purchase of medical supplies and personnel to fight the virus. But the move was met with criticism from some lawmakers and was opposed by the Pentagon.  Critics say Trump’s declaration is a publicity stunt that will not help to fund the response to the virus.  Meanwhile, across the world, leaders are using the crisis to extend their control.  After the WHO declared the global health emergency, Putin announced that Russia would close its borders to Ebola patients. This is an attempt to shut down the flow of information about the virus and to demonize Ebola as a dangerous and dangerous virus.   Xi’s China has also been trying to control the information about the virus. On Thursday, the Chinese government announced that it would block websites and social media platforms that promote the spread of the virus.  This is an attempt to restrict the access of the public to information about the virus and to suppress criticism of the Chinese government’s response to the crisis.

The kits are designed to help determine if an individual has coronavirus.  NOVO Scientific, a South Korean company, developed prototype coronavirus test kits in three weeks. The kits were created to help identify coronavirus infections more quickly and accurately.  Since the coronavirus first started spreading in early October, the South Korean company StemExpress has been ramping up its efforts to create test kits to detect the virus.  According to the company, its main goal has been to help hospitals and other healthcare organizations quickly identify people who might be infected with the virus, and to provide those people with the necessary tests and information to help them manage their illness.  StemExpress has also been working to develop new test methods, and to create kits that are more user-friendly and less expensive than those currently available.  In the past three weeks, the company has reportedly produced over 1,000 coronavirus test kits. The kits are currently being distributed to hospitals and other healthcare organizations in South Korea, and the company is also in the process of developing kits for export to other countries.  StemExpress's efforts underscore the importance of creating rapid test kits for viruses like the coronavirus, which can help to protect both the health of people who are infected and the healthcare systems that are tasked with diagnosing and treating those people.  Coronavirus is a serious issue that people across the world are worried about. There are currently no vaccines or treatments available, and anyone who is exposed to the virus risks severe health complications. As a result, it is important that people have access to accurate testing methods to determine if they have been exposed to the virus.

Despite criticism from some regulators and airlines, there is little evidence that the 737 Max is unsafe. The biggest threat to Boeing from the 737 Max crisis appears to be lost sales and customer distrust.  ""Boeing has warned of a potential “material adverse effect” to its 737 MAX programme as a result of the global coro-navirus pandemic, according to an earnings call transcript.""  READ MORE  Boeing is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers, and the 737 Max crisis has significantly weighed on its share prices. But the coronavirus could actually be worse for the company, according to a report by Bloomberg.  The crisis has caused airlines to cancel orders for the 737 Max, and this could permanently damage Boeing's market share. The collapse in demand could mean that Boeing will have to drastically reduce the prices of its existing aircraft in order to compete.  Moreover, airlines may not be the only ones to suffer from the 737 Max crisis. Many companies that rely on the aircraft for their transport are likely to be affected, including FedEx, UPS, and DHL.  The outlook for Boeing is uncertain, but the coronavirus could have a much greater impact on the company's profits and market share than the 737 Max crisis.  An airborne coronavirus pandemic could have a bigger impact on Boeing than the 737 Max crisis, according to a Reuters report.  The airline manufacturer has a significant presence in China, where a number of 737 Max aircraft are operated. A widespread coronavirus pandemic could impact aircraft sales, as passengers with newly developed coronavirus-related respiratory illnesses switch to other airlines.  The 737 Max crisis has had a smaller impact on Boeing's financial standings, as the company has already booked a significant amount of replacements for the aircraft.']",

However, the protests have also become a criminal enterprise, with authorities using excessive force to suppress dissent.  The protests first began as a response to proposed legislations that would have allowed mainland Chinese citizens to vote in the annual election for the leader of Hong Kong. These proposed changes were vehemently opposed by the pro-democracy activists, who believed that the leader of Hong Kong should be chosen by the people of Hong Kong.  The protests quickly grew out of control, with demonstrators blockading major roads and occupying various government buildings. In early October, police responded with a forceful crackdown, using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters. Dozens of people were injured, and several were arrested.  Since then, the protests have turned into an open criminal enterprise. Protesters have been accused of engaging in vandalism, theft, and assault. In some cases, protesters have even been accused of collaborating with the triads, Hong Kong's largest organized crime syndicate.  Authorities have responded to the protests by using excessive force, which has only served to criminalize the protesters further. The protests have become a playground for criminal gangs and corrupt officials, with the authorities looking the other way in exchange for political favors.

17,From east Paris to world fame -- how imagination and travel fueled Christian Louboutin's success,"['When Christian Louboutin opened his first boutique in Paris in 1976, he had no idea of the global success he would achieve. It was only after he began traveling and dreaming of other worlds that his shoes began to take on an elevated status, becoming coveted accessories worn by Hollywood celebrities and global trendsetters. He has since become a household name, presiding over one of the world's most successful luxury shoe brands. In this excerpt from ""The Richest Man in the World: The Story of Bernard Arnault,"" author Reid Hoffman tells the story of how Louboutin's imagination and travel helped him build his business.  As Louboutin opened his first boutique in 1976, he had no idea of the global success he would achieve. It was only after he began traveling and dreaming of other worlds that his shoes began to take on an elevated status, becoming coveted accessories worn by Hollywood celebrities and global trendsetters. He has since become a household name, presiding over one of the world's most successful luxury shoe brands.  To understand how Louboutin became one of the richest men in the world, one must look back at his early life and see how his imagination and travel helped him build his business. Born in the east Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois in 1949, Louboutin's love of fashion and shoes was instilled in him from an early age. His father was a tailor and his mother a seamstress, so Christian grew up dressing and making his own shoes.  After completing his military service, Louboutin began to work as a shoe salesman. In 1976, he opened his first boutique in Paris, and his shoes quickly became popular among the city's fashion elite. Over the next few years, he opened more boutiques across France and, in 1978, he opened his first store outside of France, in New York City.  Louboutin's shoes quickly became popular not only among Parisians, but also among celebrities and trendsetters around the world. In 1984, he opened his first flagship store in London, and his shoes began to be worn by celebrities such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue, and Sarah Jessica Parker.

20,Mount Everest closed over coronavirus fears,"['The Mount Everest climbing season has closed after fears of a coronavirus pandemic.  The “mountain of dreams” has been closed for both climbers and Sherpa since the first confirmed case of the virus in a Nepalese climber on May 28.  The climbing season usually starts in April and runs through to May.  Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain, has closed to visitors over health fears over the coronavirus.  The Nepalese government said on Sunday the mountain was closed in an effort to protect the safety of climbers and tourists.  It follows concerns that people who have been to the region are at greater risk of being infected with the virus.  The Mount Everest Foundation said the decision was made in the spirit of “safety for everyone”.  So far, only one person has died from the virus – a Nepalese man in April.  Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, has been closed to climbing due to fears over the coronavirus. The move comes as Mount Everest's Base Camp is already packed with climbers preparing to scale the world's tallest peak.  The Nepalese government has said that all climbers on Mount Everest are being advised to stay away from the mountain until further notice. This includes Americans who are currently on the mountain.  The closing of Mount Everest comes as the coronavirus, which has killed at least 22 people in the Middle East and Europe, has sparked concerns that the virus could reach high altitude areas, including Mount Everest.  Mount Everest, which stands at 8,848 metres (29,029 feet), is the tallest mountain in the world. The mountain is also located in Asia, a region where the coronavirus is currently rife.']",
21,With society shutting down will Tokyo 2020 go ahead?,"['It is unclear how society will shutdown, but if it does Tokyo 2020 would likely not go ahead.  There is no current indication that Tokyo 2020 would be cancelled if society shut down.  This is a difficult question to answer as it largely depends on the actions of individual governments and organisations. If the majority of governments and organisations decided to withdraw support for Tokyo 2020, it is likely that the Olympics would be cancelled. However, if individual governments and organisations do decide to continue supporting the Olympics, then Tokyo 2020 may still go ahead.  There is no easy answer for this question as it depends on a number of factors, including the financial stability of the host country and the health of the organizing committee. In general, it is difficult to say definitively whether a country's society will ""shut down"" in the context of a large-scale international event, given that different events can have a variety of impacts on different parts of society. That said, given the magnitude and global nature of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, it is likely that some elements of Japanese society will be impacted in a negative way. If this happens, the Games may not be able to take place as planned.  There is no clear answer, as Tokyo 2020 could theoretically go ahead without society functioning as normal. However, it is unlikely that the Olympic Games would be successfully held without the support of the public.  This is a difficult question to answer. As of right now, it appears that society is continuing to function. However, it is possible that things could change in the future and society could completely collapse, leading to Tokyo 2020 not happening.']",

25,Why the impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses,"['College campuses are often bustling metropolises of students and young adults. There are a lot of people and a lot of places where the coronavirus could spread easily. College campuses often have large rooms and hallways where the virus could spread quickly, and many colleges have dormitories that could be impacted as well. This could mean a lot of people getting sick, and even a lot of deaths.  The impact of coronavirus could be particularly bad on college campuses because there are a high number of students and a high number of people who are susceptible to the virus. Colleges are also a concentrated place where people come into contact with a lot of different people, which could expose them to the virus.   College campuses are densely populated with people who are vulnerable to coronavirus. This is because many students live in close quarters, and people who are sick are more likely to spread the virus.  College students are also more likely to be mobile, which could lead to them coming into contact with other people who are infected with coronavirus. This is particularly true on weekends, when students are more likely to be out and about.  College campuses also tend to have less robust healthcare systems than the general population, which could make it difficult for students to receive the medical care they need if they are infected with coronavirus.   coronavirus is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness in people of all ages. It is believed that the virus is responsible for a number of recent outbreaks of respiratory illness, and it is considered a major public health threat.

27,What the US can learn from Singapore's coronavirus strategy,"['The United States has avoided a coronavirus pandemic since 2009, but Singapore's experience provides some useful lessons.  First, Singapore made use of a national coordinated response to contain the virus. Hospitals, clinics, and schools were all activated to help identify and monitor cases, and communication between different sectors was critical to ensuring that everyone was working together.  Second, Singaporean officials were quick to place restrictions on travel and trade. This was a key decision, as it helped to limit the number of people who became infected and helped to prevent the virus from spreading more widely.  Finally, Singapore made a concerted effort to educate the public about the dangers of coronavirus and the steps they could take to protect themselves. This was essential, as many people were not aware of the virus or the steps they could take to prevent it from spreading.  The United States could learn a lot from Singapore's coronavirus strategy, as the city-state has been able to rapidly contain the virus while minimising economic and social disruption. In particular, the US could consider implementing mandatory quarantine provisions for citizens arriving from countries affected by the virus, as well as setting up a global coordination centre to better monitor the virus and provide quick response capabilities.  The United States could learn a lot from Singapore's coronavirus strategy and policies. Singapore has been proactive in preventing the spread of coronavirus and has implemented a number of effective policies.  First, Singapore has mobilized a large and strongly coordinated response. The government has activated more than 20 ministries and agencies, coordinated with UN agencies, and deployed a large number of health professionals. Second, Singapore has put in place strong risk communication measures. The government has issued warnings to the public, issued closed-circuit television messages to caregivers, and established social media channels to provide information to the public. Third, Singapore has implemented stringent controls on travel. The government has implemented restrictions on travel to regions with high coronavirus risk and has shut down travel links to affected countries. Fourth, Singapore has collaborated with other countries to share outbreak information and Patient Zero information. Fifth, Singapore has developed a stockpile of antiviral drugs and has been distributing them to hospitals and clinics. Sixth, Singapore is prepared to implement national health care initiatives in the event of a pandemic.']",

Now, 20 years later, Montagnier is still speaking out about the dangers of HIV, and he is urging policymakers to take action to address the pandemic. In a new interview with The Observer, Montagnier warned that the virus is still spreading rapidly, and that there is still no cure for HIV.  ""We are in a very, very difficult situation,"" Montagnier said. ""This virus is still spreading very rapidly, and there is no vaccine or cure, which is a real tragedy.""

The fund is donating $3 million to support the educational initiatives of the Afghan Women's Network (AWN), which includes the construction of a dormitory for Afghan girls in Kabul.  ""Education is one of the best ways to break the cycle of violence and poverty,"" Jolie said. ""It's why we're committed to helping Afghan girls gain access to education, and we hope that our donation will help make a real difference.""  ""What we must do for Afghan women"" is a speech delivered by Angelina Jolie on October 12, 2013, during the United Nations General Assembly. Jolie called for increasing access to education for Afghan women, advocating for the prevention of child marriages, and supporting women's rights to own land and vote.  Edited by Megan DeFranco, Huffington Post  When we think of women in Afghanistan, we often think of the victims of abuse and violence--women who have had to flee their homes or who have been forced into marriages that have forced them into a life of servitude.  But there are also Afghan women who are leading successful lives, and who are making a difference in their communities.  In an interview with The Guardian, actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie said that the United States and the rest of the world must do more for Afghan women if they are to create a stable future for themselves and their children. Jolie said that the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan has had a devastating impact on women and girls, and that the situation is only going to get worse unless urgent action is taken.  ""We have to start understanding that, as long as we are here, there is going to be a lot of pain and a lot of suffering,"" Jolie said. ""So let's figure out a way to do something about it.""  Jolie is right. Women and girls in Afghanistan are experiencing a humanitarian crisis on an unprecedented scale. More than 2 million women and girls have been displaced by the conflict, and an estimated 1.5 million Afghan women have been raped by members of the Taliban or other armed groups.  The United States and the international community must do more to help these women and girls. Governments and donors need to provide more assistance to vulnerable women and girls, including providing education, health care, and economic opportunities. NGOs and humanitarian organizations must be able to operate freely and provide assistance to the most vulnerable women and girls.  Women and girls in Afghanistan are counting on us.']",

The Hunt: Origins  The Hunt: Origins is a political exploitation film that takes advantage of the partisan divide in America. The film follows a group of conservatives who are out to capture a liberal senator who is responsible for a major scandal.  The Hunt  The Hunt is a new partisan exploitation film that is set to release in 2020. The film is inspired by the real-life hunt for political figures that took place in Russia during the Putin years.  The Hunt is a forthcoming video game for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms that is based on the 1976 film of the same name. The game is produced by the independent development studio Rebellion Developments, and it is set in the year 2065, two years after the events of the film. The game's plot follows a team of bounty hunters who are sent to track down and capture a scientific genius who has fled to the middle of a partisan-infested zone.  The game's promotional materials make use of the partisan divide in US society as a hook to sell an exploitation throwback. One ad features a clip of Senator John McCain denouncing the game's release, while another features a clip of Senator Bernie Sanders praising it.  In 'The Hunt,' a new horror game for Switch, the player takes on the role of a hunter who must use their cunning and strength to survive in a world overrun by monsters.  While the game is ostensibly set in a partisan divide-ridden America, the developers appear to have been more interested in exploiting the current climate of fear and division than in actually creating a game that takes place in a realistic world.  Players must use their wits and strength to overcome hordes of monsters that roam the open world in search of human flesh. The game is advertised as being “politically charged,” and the developers have even released a promotional video that features commentary on the current political landscape.  The game is based on the popular horror game franchise of the same name, and it appears to be designed as an explicitly Trump-supporting exploitation throwback.  The game is currently only available for purchase on the Switch eShop, but it is likely that it will soon be released on other platforms as well.  The game's politicized nature and blatant exploitation of political division will likely alienate many potential players, and it is likely that it will not achieve the widespread success that the developers may have hoped for.']",

60,'The Banker' yields a modest return on Apple's first bite at movies,"['Apple's foray into the movie industry yielded a modest return in its first year.    According to research firm IHS, The Banker yielded an estimated return on investment (ROI) of 8 percent for the six months following its release in February 2016.    Apple's move into the movie industry was widely seen as risky and the company was criticized for investing too much in films without a track record of box office success. Its first release, The Banker, was based off of a novel by David Baldacci.  In the first six months of 2018, ""The Banker"" yielded a modest return on Apple's first bite at movies. The film generated an estimated $7 million in revenue during that time, according to BoxOffice Mojo. That's about on par with other 2018 releases such as ""A Quiet Place"" and ""Solo: A Star Wars Story.""  For its first foray into the movie business, Apple didn't waste any time in courting Hollywood's biggest names.  The company announced Monday that it had struck a deal with The Banker, a new thriller from director Morten Tyldum. Tyldum, who helmed the Academy Award-nominated film The Danish Girl, will direct the film, which will star Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.  The Banker is set in the world of high-stakes financial trading and follows a young banker as he navigates the treacherous waters of the Wall Street sharks. Apple will initially release the film in the United States and other select markets before expanding to a wider release.  While it's not immediately clear how much Apple will make from the movie, it's clearly betting that its influence and name recognition will help The Banker flourish in theaters.  Apple's foray into the movie industry is hardly a new phenomenon. In late 2015, the company announced a deal with Steven Spielberg to produce a feature film about the life of Steve Jobs. The film, which is still in development, is said to be based on the book Jobs by Walter Isaacson. That project is expected to take several years to complete.  Apple's movie ambitions come at a time when the company is increasingly looking to venture beyond its core market of mobile devices. Earlier this year, the company released its first television series, the reboot of the 1977 cult favorite M*A*S*H. And in September, it announced a partnership with Disney to produce original movies and series for its digital streaming service, Apple TV.  While it's unclear how successful Apple's foray into the movie business will be, the company is clearly betting that its name and prestige will help The Banker stand out from the crowd.']",
61,"Al Pacino hunts Nazis in 'Hunters,' a series whose premise tops its execution","['""Hunters"" is a seven-episode show released on Netflix that mixes detective and thriller genres with a touch of horror. Set in the present day, the series follows a team of FBI agents who are tasked with tracking down Nazi war criminals who are currently living in America.  The premise is sound, but the execution falls flat. The show drags on for far too long, and the characters are one-dimensional and poorly written. Worst of all, the show features some cringe-worthy scenes involving Nazis and gore that is unnecessary and completely unnecessary.  Overall, ""Hunters"" is an unenjoyable experience that is best avoided.  “Hunters” is a series whose premise tops its execution. A decade after the end of World War II, a team of ex-soldiers, policemen and scientists set out to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. The series starts out promisingly enough as we see our investigators work their way through the ranks of the Third Reich, until it becomes clear that the potential scope of this series is much larger than it first appears.  The problem with “Hunters” is that it doesn’t seem to know what it is. It could be a crime procedural, a thriller or even a historical drama, but it never quite settles on one mode of storytelling. Characters are introduced and then quickly forgotten, setting up half-baked plotlines that never develop. Worse still, the series’ trademark visual flourishes are barely used, rendering much of the drama unsatisfying.  That said, there are moments when “Hunters” shines. The acting is uniformly excellent, and the series’ claustrophobic atmosphere is well executed. Overall, though, “Hunters” is a frustrating watch that fails to live up to its potential.']",

In this film, the town of Hope is in trouble and it's up to the young protagonist, leaders of the town, and some of the townspeople to save it.  The story is heartwarming and will leave you feeling inspired. The animation is fantastic and the characters are likable and believable. You will find yourself rooting for the heroes of the town and feeling a sense of joy when they achieve their goals.  This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is intense and may make you cry. If you are looking for an emotionally charged movie that will leave you feeling satisfied, then Onward is definitely the film for you.  As of this writing, ""Onward"" has made over $600 million at the global box office. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly suggest you head on over to your nearest theater and check it out. Pixar seems to be on a quest to make us cry with each and every film they release, and ""Onward"" is no exception.  The film is about a group of youngsters who travel to the Moon in order to find a new home for the planet. While there, they encounter all sorts of challenges and tribulations, which ultimately result in them evolving as people.  Throughout the film, we witness the characters go through some very tough times, and it's these scenes that really hit home and make us feel the emotion. Pixar does a great job of constructing these scenes so that even the youngest members of the audience can understand what's going on.  Even though ""Onward"" is a kids film, it doesn't shy away from dealing with controversial issues. For example, one of the main characters is a transgender woman, and this is something that is not often seen in children's movies.  Pixar has once again shown us that they are masters of crafting memorable and emotional stories that are perfect for all ages. ""Onward"" is definitely a film that you don't want to miss.']",

73,Is DNA the key to protecting Earth's tallest species?,"['While DNA is not the sole determinant of species survival, it does play an important role. Studies have shown that genetic diversity is key to the survival of many tall species, such as the giant panda and the giraffe. More diversity translates to a greater likelihood of overcoming obstacles and adapting to changing conditions. By preserving and protecting the genetic diversity of tall species, we can help ensure their long-term survival.  There is no definitive answer, but it is thought that the preservation of genetic diversity is the key to protecting Earth's tallest species.DNA is the genetic information that creates the characteristics of an individual organism, and it is this information that is most vulnerable to damage and loss. If a species' genetic diversity is reduced, there is a greater chance that the species will go extinct.  One of the best ways to protect Earth's tallest species is to keep their populations healthy, since it is taller species that are more likely to dominate their environments. By understanding the genetic information of Earth's tallest species, we can better conserve and protect them.  There is no one answer to this question as different species would have to be looked at in different ways to see if DNA was the key to their conservation. Some scientists may look at the genetic diversity of a species to see if there are any areas where the different populations could be split, and if so, whether protecting these areas with DNA conservation could help to keep the populations separate. Others may look at the geographical distribution of a species to see if any protected areas could be created to help protect their habitat. Ultimately, the answer to this question would vary depending on the specific species and where it is located.']",
74,One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government,"['The Kotak Mahindra Bank was nationalised by the Indian government in August 2017, following a period of intense speculation and concern over its health.  State-owned ICICI Bank was rescued by the Indian government in 2008 after it was heavily in debt.  One of India's biggest banks has been rescued by the government.  The Punjab National Bank said on Friday that it had received a $2.6bn (£1.8bn) bailout from the government.  The move is likely to ease the pressure on other lenders, which are battling to remain solvent.  Punjab National Bank is one of the ten largest banks in the country.  The government has been stepping in to support a number of banks in a bid to stabilise the economy.  In January, the government announced a $17.5bn bailout for state-owned banks.  Asian markets closed mixed on Friday with the Nikkei 225 index down 0.8% while the Hang Seng was up 0.5%.  India's biggest bank, State Bank of India (SBI), was rescued by the government on February 17, 2019. The bailout came after the bank reported a loss of Rs 12,509 crore for the fiscal year ended December 2018. The government infusion will help SBI weather the current market turbulence.  On Monday, the Indian government announced that India's largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), would be rescued by the government. The bank had been in talks with the government for months over a potential bailout, but the terms of the deal have not been released.  SBI is India's largest bank by total assets, and is also the country's oldest bank. The bank has been struggling in recent years, partly due to weak economic conditions in the country and bans by the Indian government on certain financial products.  The bailout deal is likely to help SBI revive its faltering businesses, but it is unclear how much money the bank will receive. In a statement, the Indian government said that the bailout would provide ""financial assistance and relief to the State Bank of India, which is a PSU [public sector enterprise] under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance.""  The rescue deal comes as India's banking sector is increasingly under pressure. In November, the country's second-largest bank, the ICICI Bank, announced that it would be merging with another bank. The merger caused concern among consumers and investors, as it raised questions about the health of the Indian banking sector.  The Indian government has been struggling to revive the country's weak economy. The country's GDP growth slowed to 5.3% in 2016 from 5.5% in 2015, and is expected to decline even further in 2017. In March, the Indian government announced a $75 billion stimulus package to support the economy, but it has been met with criticism from economists.']",
75,India's top court strikes down ban on cryptocurrency trading,"['India's top court has struck down a ban on cryptocurrency trading, marking a major victory for the digital currency industry in the country.  The court ruled that the ban, which was introduced in 2017 by the country's finance minister, Wasim Akram, was unconstitutional.  ""The central bank cannot prohibit any transaction that is legal under the [country's] tax laws,"" the court said in its ruling.  The finance minister had argued that cryptocurrency was a risky investment, and that the government needed to be able to monitor its.  However, the court disagreed, saying that ""cryptocurrencies do not constitute a legal or illegal currency.""  This is a huge win for the digital currency industry, which has been battling against government censorship in many parts of the world.  It also signals the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in India, one of the world's most populous countries.  India's top court has struck down a ban on cryptocurrency trading, a move that could boost the country's largely unprofitable digital asset industry.  The court said on Thursday that trading in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets is not a financial activity and is not covered by existing financial laws.  The decision clears the way for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country to operate freely.  Cryptocurrencies have been struggling in many global markets, but they have been gaining popularity in India as a way to cut through complex and expensive currency transactions.  The Indian market for cryptocurrencies was worth $7.5 billion in 2018, according to industry tracker CoinMarketCap.  The Indian Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a government ban on cryptocurrency trading, paving the way for wider adoption of the digital coin technology in the country.  In a unanimous ruling, the top court said the ban was unconstitutional because it did not properly process digital currency transactions.  ""We declare that the ban on crypto-currency trading is unconstitutional,"" Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said. ""This is a landmark judgement that will open the way for legitimate crypto-currency activities.""  Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is not backed by any government or central bank and is traded on decentralized exchanges.  The ruling comes as authorities in India are trying to understand the potential of the digital currency and how to regulate it.  Earlier this year, the government announced a ban on all investments in virtual currencies, saying they were not legal and were associated with prostitution and money laundering.  But the top court said the trading of cryptocurrency was not covered by the ban and should be allowed.  Tuesday's ruling is a major victory for the crypto-currency community in India, which has been opposed to the ban by some major players in the industry.  Analysts say the ruling opens the door for the wider adoption of the digital coin technology in India, where many people still don't have access to basic financial services.']",

Mr Sharma also said there was a need to ""keep our culture and tradition alive"" and ""not allow divisive politics to erode our religious tolerance"".

""What is happening now is not just regrettable but the worst it has been in many years,"" he said. ""The government must understand that unless religious tolerance is preserved, our democracy will not flourish.""  Joshi's comments come in the aftermath of a series of controversial government decisions which have seen restrictions placed on the religious freedom of several minority faiths.  Earlier this year, the Indian government announced plans to introduce a bill which would criminalise religious conversion from Hinduism or Islam – a move which has been labelled as an attack on minority faiths.  In February, the government also banned the sale of cattle for slaughter in central India – a decision which has been criticised as discriminatory towards the Muslim community.  In response to these alarming developments, Human Rights Watch India has called on the Indian government to ""immediately end its assault on religious freedom"".  The situation in India is hardly unique – religious tolerance is one of the key strengths which has helped make the country one of the most successful democracies in the world.  However, Joshi's comments suggest that the current government may be willing to take steps which could damage the foundations of religious tolerance in the country.']",
89,Why India's citizenship law crosses the line,"['By Pratima Ranjan  The Times of India  April 27, 2006  A recent change in the citizenship law of India is being seen as a major step backwards by human rights groups. The law imposes a number of tough conditions on people seeking Indian citizenship, including that they must be of ""good character"" and have a ""genuine interest in Indian culture"".  These conditions are too tough, say human rights groups, and could be used to arbitrarily discriminate against ethnic and religious minorities in India.  The proposed citizenship law, which is currently being debated in the Indian Parliament, has been criticised by the United Nations, which has called for it to be scrapped.  The new law, which is set to come into effect from July 2006, has been introduced by the Indian government in response to the increasing number of people from other countries seeking citizenship in India.  Under the proposed law, people who want to become Indian citizens must prove that they have a ""genuine interest in Indian culture"", and must not have any criminal convictions or offences against Indian law. They must also demonstrate that they have a good character, and that they have been living in India for a minimum of five years.  Human rights groups say that the new law is discriminatory and could be used to arbitrarily discriminate against ethnic and religious minorities in India.  ""The proposed citizenship law is discriminatory, and will be used to arbitrarily discriminate against ethnic and religious minorities in India,"" said Sunila Desai of the Human Rights Watch Asia Division.  ""The conditions for acquiring citizenship are too tough, and could be used to unfairly discriminate against people from minority groups.""  The law also imposes a number of other conditions on people seeking citizenship in India, including that they must have a ""genuine and settled intention to reside in India permanently"".

90,India: The world leader in Internet shutdowns,"['India is the world leader in Internet shutdowns, accounting for 43% of the total number of shutdowns in the world in 2017. India’s high rate of Internet shutdowns is likely due to the country’s strict censorship laws and extensive monitoring of online communications.  India currently ranks as the world leader in Internet shutdowns. According to a 2018 report by Freedom House, India went from ranking 48th to 34th in terms of Internet freedom.  Part of the reason for India’s rise in Internet freedom rankings is the country’s recent efforts to crackdown on online dissent. In February 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a new anti-spy law that allows for online censorship and surveillance. The law has been criticized for its lack of due process and its potential to target journalists and political opponents.  In addition to online censorship, India has also been aggressive in its efforts to block access to websites that it deems objectionable. Between January and June 2018, Indian authorities blocked more than 1,000 websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google.  Overall, the Freedom House report paints a mixed picture of India’s progress in terms of freedom of the Internet. While the country has made progress in terms of its legal framework, it has also been aggressive in its efforts to crackdown on online dissent.  Between December 2012 and December 2013, India had the dubious honor of being the world leader in Internet shutdowns. According to the Freedom House report, “India: The World Leader in Internet shutdowns,” India undertook “a record number of Internet shutdowns” in 2013, rolling out an unprecedented number of temporary blocks on various websites and social media platforms.  While the motivations for these shutdowns were largely political, they had a detrimental effect on citizens’ access to information and freedom of expression. Indeed, in many cases, these restrictions blocked access to key news and social media platforms, leaving citizens without a means of communicating and organizing.  India’s crackdown on online freedom is not isolated, however. As the report notes, India is “following in a long line of countries that have placed restrictions on the Internet in an effort to control information.” Indeed, India’s approach to regulating the Internet is not unique, but it is one of the most extreme examples of this trend.']",

The Australian research group, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that there was no clear evidence that temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) helped to slow the spread of SARS in either 2003 or 2004. In contrast, the Singaporean group, which published its results in the journal Nature, found that there was a small but statistically significant decrease in the number of SARS cases in the country during the winter months, when average temperatures were below 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit).  However, both studies cautioned that it is still too early to say definitively whether the warmer weather was responsible for the decrease in SARS cases. There is also the possibility that other factors, such as improved public health measures, were also at play.  “We can say that it’s interesting, but it’s not proof,” said study author Ian Joseph, a professor of biochemistry at the University of New South Wales in Australia.  There is not much evidence that warmer weather helps fight the coronavirus, according to health officials in Singapore and Australia. Both countries are currently experiencing a coronavirus outbreak, with more than 60confirmed cases.  The Australian government has cautioned that the weather may not be a significant factor in the spread of the virus, as it has been seen in other countries where the virus has spread rapidly. In Singapore, health officials have said that warmer weather may help to reduce the spread of the virus, as it is more likely to be transmitted through coughs and sneezes.

The study, led by Associate Professor Jason West of Southern Cross University, found that the number of bushfires in Australia has increased by about 30% since the early 1990s, and this increase is likely attributable to both climate change and human activities, such as the use of firewood and agricultural practices.  The findings suggest that Australia's growing fire problem should be a top priority for the country's policymakers, as it will likely have serious environmental and social consequences.  ""Our findings suggest that Australia's growing fire problem should be a top priority for the country's policymakers, as it will likely have serious environmental and social consequences,"" said Associate Professor West.  The study used a novel data set that tracks fire incidence across Australia's eastern and southeastern regions, covering a period of more than two decades. It found that the overall number of bushfires increased by 31% between 1992 and 2016, and this increase was largely due to an increase in arson fires.  The study also found that the increase in arson fires was most pronounced in regions that are heavily affected by climate change, such as southeastern Australia.  Associate Professor West says that the findings suggest that both climate change and human activities are likely to be responsible for the increase in bushfires in Australia.  ""The increase in arson fires is most pronounced in regions that are heavily affected by climate change, such as southeastern Australia.""  ""Climate change makes bushfires more frequent and intense, while human activities like the use of firewood and agricultural practices can also cause fires,"" he said.  ""Firewood is a big contributor to bushfire incidence in Australia, accounting for about one third of all fires. The use of firewood is likely to increase in Australia as the country warms, and this could lead to even more fires.""  The study also found that the increase in bushfire incidence was not evenly distributed across Australia, with some regions experiencing far greater increases than others.

At the end of the 19th century, the thylacine was hunted to extinction, with the last confirmed sighting taking place in 1936.’s eastern extremity  The eastern extremity of Australia is a world away from the mainlands, and this lion with teeth like bolt-cutters once inhabited its far-flung corners.  Known locally as the Longcat, this lion – which was about the size of a small dog – has been extinct for around 50 years.  Its extinction is a shame, as the Longcat was a strikingly beautiful creature that was feared by its prey.  “I know of no other animal quite like it,” writes wildlife photographer Greg Nash in his book Wild Australia.  “It had razor-sharp teeth that were almost as long as its head, and it had a mane of thick, curly hair.”  The Longcat was first discovered in 1967 by an Australian farmer named Les Burdett.  Since then, it has been known only from a handful of specimen bones that have been recovered.  While it’s not clear why the Longcat went extinct, it is likely that humans played a role in its demise.  “The Longcat was probably killed by humans,” says Nash.  “Its thick mane would have made it an easy target for hunters, and its sharp teeth would have made it a formidable predator.”']",

The coronavirus, also known as SARS, is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia. It has already caused problems for health workers in several countries, and is suspected of being behind the global outbreak of respiratory illnesses that has led to more than 1,000 deaths.  So far, the coronavirus has been reported in 28 countries, including the United States, which has seen a handful of cases. There is no specific treatment for the virus, and it can be fatal in some cases.  Meanwhile, stranded lobsters are a common sight in many parts of the world as a result of the ongoing lobster fishery ban. The ban, which is being implemented as part of an effort to protect the endangered monkfish, has caused a significant shortage of the seafood in many areas.  Story continues  Both of these problems are likely to continue for some time, as the coronavirus is highly contagious and there is currently no cure or vaccine available.    If you think the Ebola virus is bad, just wait until you hear about the coronavirus.  As of Feb. 12, 2019, there have been 1,629 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, resulting in 8,121 infections and 4,951 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

114,How tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England,"['In the early 19th century, tattoos were still seen as barbaric and were primarily used by sailors and pirates. However, starting in the 1840s and 1850s, tattoos began becoming more popular in England as they started being seen as a way to show off one's fashionable and rebellious side. At the time, tattoos were seen as a sign of being tough and carefree, and many wealthy and aristocratic people began getting tattoos as a way to show off their unique personality.  In Victorian England, tattoos became fashionable as a sign of rebellion and individuality. The Victorians were a conservative society, and as such, tattoos were seen as a statement of independence. By getting a tattoo, people were demonstrating that they were not afraid to break from traditional norms.  Tattoos became fashionable in Victorian England due to several factors. The first reason is that tattoos were seen as a sign of barbarism and deviance in previous centuries. This was largely because Europeans had never seen tattoos before and didn't understand the significance of them. This gradually changed over time, and by the 1800s, tattoos had become fashionable among people in high society.  The second reason is that tattoos were seen as a way to rebel against traditional social norms. In Victorian England, tattoos were seen as a marker of being unruly and unconventional. This was particularly popular among young people who wanted to show their defiance of traditionalsociety.  Finally, tattoos were seen as a way to make yourself look more attractive. In Victorian England, people were very aware of their appearance androgynous look was seen as undesirable. By getting tattoos, people could make themselves look more masculine or feminine, which was seen as desirable.']",

In what is being described as a 'heart-wrenching tragedy', a woman and three young children have died in a car fire in Brisbane, allegedly started by her husband.  The three youngsters - a two-year-old girl, a one-year-old boy, and a three-month-old girl - died in the blaze, which ripped through a ute parked outside a home in the state's south on Saturday morning.  According to local media reports, the 37-year-old husband was the only survivor and is in a serious condition in hospital.  The tragedy is being described as a 'absolute tragedy' by Queensland Police Inspector Glen Turner, who said the deaths had hit the close-knit community 'hard'.  Inspector Turner said it was too early to say what caused the blaze, but investigators were working to determine whether the husband was deliberately starting the fire.  Police say they are not looking for any other suspects.  The family had been staying with family after their home in the suburban area of Logan Village was destroyed in a fire earlier this year.  The children's grandmother told ABC News that the toddlers were 'the loves of our lives'.  Updated  A woman and three children have died in a car fire allegedly started by her husband in Brisbane.  Emergency services were called to the fire at a home in the suburb of Everton, south of the city, shortly before 4:00pm (AEST) on Tuesday.  Acting Senior Sergeant Shane Archer said the husband had been charged with arson and three counts of manslaughter.  ""The husband is alleged to have started the fire in a car which then led to the deaths of the four occupants,"" he said.  ""The three children, aged five, three and one, are believed to have died from the fire.""  Sergeant Archer said the woman and the older child were also injured in the blaze.  ""They've suffered severe burns and are currently in a very serious condition in hospital,"" he said.  Police said it was not yet clear how the fire started.

The Ministry of Health says the tissue will be used to help regenerate and heal the injuries.  Mount Tarawera erupted on May 3, killing one person and injuring dozens of people.  A New Zealand laboratory has ordered 1,292 square feet of skin from patients injured in the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, ABC News reports.  The skin will be used to help heal burn victims, and will be sent to a laboratory in New Zealand's North Island.  ""The skin will be used to help heal burn victims, and will be sent to a laboratory in New Zealand's North Island,"" Trevor McClure, director of the North Island laboratory, told ABC News. ""It is a small gesture but it is our way of saying thank you to those New Zealanders who lost their lives and were injured in the eruption.""  In total, 1,292 square feet of skin from 605 patients has been ordered.  The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners has called for 1,292 square feet of skin from victims of the May 18 eruption of Mt.

123,"Fight is not over, says winner of vaginal mesh implant court victory","['A woman who was awarded $4.3 million in a vaginal mesh implant lawsuit has not given up the fight, her lawyer said on Thursday.  Chelsea Clarke said her decision to fight her vaginal mesh implant lawsuit was not a victory, but a step in the right direction.  A woman who won a court victory against a company that made a vaginal mesh implant has said the fight is not over.  The battle to get vaginal mesh implants removed from women’s bodies is far from over, but one woman has won a hard-fought court victory against thedevice’s manufacturer. In a verdict announced on Wednesday, a federal court in California sided with a woman who argued that the Ethicon Inc. G3 Meshabortion device caused her severe vaginal pain, irritation and infection. The court ordered Ethicon to pay the woman $875,000 in damages, ruling that the company’s “mishandled” products caused “severe and permanent injuries.”  The decision comes as a major victory for women affected by vaginal mesh implants, who have long argued that the devices are flawed and can cause significant pain and damage. The devices are used to treat women who have undergone surgery to remove the Vagina, and are made of mesh that is inserted into the woman’s vagina to hold the vaginal muscles in place.  But the devices have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with many women reporting serious complications after receiving them. In some cases, the mesh has become embedded in the woman’s body, causing unbearable pain and difficulty in having children. The devices have also been linked to a higher risk of pelvic floor damage, urinary infections and even sexual dysfunction.  The verdict in the vaginal mesh implant case is one of many recent victories for women fighting for their right to be treated properly and without pain. Earlier this year, a federal court in Texas ruled that a women who had undergone surgery to remove her vaginal mesh implant was entitled to compensation from thedevice’s manufacturer. And last year, a court in Britain ruled that a woman who had received a vaginal mesh implant to treat her prolapse was entitled to compensation from the manufacturer.  These court decisions underscore the importance of legal action in cases where women have been harmed by defective products. By seeking compensation from the company responsible, women can help ensure that others don’t have to go through the same experience.']",

There are only around 415,000 elephants left in the wild, compared to 1.3 million in the late 1800s. and an estimated three million in the early 1900s.  Every day, poachers kill around two elephants, and an estimated six to ten elephants are slaughtered for their ivory each day.  Policymakers and conservationists are working hard to bring the elephant population back up to a healthy level, but it is a slow and difficult process.  There are a number of things that we can do to help endangered animals, and we should all try to play our part:  Don't buy ivory  Elephants are endangered because of demand for their ivory, and we can help to stop this by not buying it.  If we can reduce the amount of ivory that is being sold, it will have a positive impact on the elephants' survival.  Support conservation  There are many organizations that are working hard to protect the elephant population.  Support these organizations and help them to continue their important work.

Amphibians are at the mercy of many factors beyond their control, including climate change, habitat destruction, and the spread of invasive species. As a result, it is difficult to say whether or not an amphibian apocalypse is impending.  If you’re listening for the amphibian apocalypse, you might want to focus on amphibian populations in the United States. A study published in the journal PLOS ONE found that the number of amphibian species in the country has declined by almost a third since the 1970s.  In recent years, scientists have been closely watching the population of amphibians around the world. With climate change, the health of these creatures may be in peril.  There are over 3,500 species of amphibians, and they play a vital role in the environment. They are able to move quickly across land and water, and their larvae can develop in many different environments.  Amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment, so scientists are closely watching their populations to see if there is a sign that their health is in peril.  One common sign that amphibians are in trouble is a decrease in their population size. amphibians may also be more susceptible to the effects of climate change.

The hurricane left the island nation virtually uninhabitable, as the water damaged or destroyed 95% of the homes and infrastructure. As a result, the Maldives government has turned to a new source of income: collecting trash from tourists.  The Maldives started charging tourists to bring their trash to the island nation in 2017. The Maldives government has set up special collection points on the main islands where tourists can drop their trash. The trash is then transferred to large trucks and transported to a landfill on the outskirts of the capital, Malé.  The Maldives’ decision to start charging tourists to bring their trash to the island nation has been met with mixed reactions. Many people argue that the Maldives’ fragile environment should not be used as a way to make money. Others argue that the Maldives government should be grateful for the money that tourists are spending in the country and should not resist their attempts to pay for the damage their trash has caused.

When the coral disappears, so will the fish, sharks and other marine life that rely on the coral for food.  This is not a true statement. Corals can survive without other marine life around them, and in some cases, reefs can even grow back when coral is absent.  If the coral disappears, so will they - the reef fish that live there.  The corals rely on their colonies of polyps to spread their brightly-colored skeletons throughout the ocean. When the polyps die, the coral eventually dies too.  When the coral disappears, so will they.  That's not true! Corals can live without other corals, they can migrate and reproduce, and they can adapt to changing conditions.  The coral will not disappear when the environment changes. Corals are able to grow back if their environment is changed back to what it was before the change.  There is no way to know for sure, but it is possible that when coral disappears, so will the fish and other organisms that live near it.  The corals will not disappear when the coral disappears, the coral is a symbiotic organism and it needs the fish that feeds on the coral to live. The coral will die because it can not photosynthesize and will eventually fall apart.  The coral reefs that dot the coastline of the Caribbean are a valuable resource both for tourism income and as a natural filter for marine life. Although the reefs are teeming with life when healthy, the increasing acidity and temperature of the water caused by climate change is causing coral to disappear at an alarming rate. If current trends continue, coral reefs could completely disappear within the next 100 years.']",

This would be the end of the human species due to the destruction of the natural world.  The report, The Sixth Extinction: An Urgent Warning, details the mounting environmental damage and the accelerating loss of biodiversity, which could lead to the extinction of many species and the destabilization of the global food chain.  The NRDC report calls on governments, businesses, and individuals to take action to prevent a sixth extinction. Initiatives proposed in the report include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding protected areas, and enhancing food production with practices that minimize pollution and water use.  The sixth extinction is now 20 years away, according to a report released Thursday by the World Conservation Union.  The world is on the brink of a devastating collapse of the natural world, the UN environmental organization warned in its ""Ecological Footprint 2016"" report.  By 2030, unless urgent steps are taken, a loss of up to 50% of global species and 70% of wildlands is likely, the report warns.  The sixth extinction, identified by scientists as the loss of more than 50% of all species on Earth, represents an ""imminent and unprecedented"" global crisis, according to the report's authors.  The culprit: human-caused climate change, loss of biodiversity, food production driven by industrial farming and the degradation of coastal and aquatic habitats.

""Unless we take quick, bold and concerted action, we stand on the brink of a global sixth extinction that could have devastating consequences for humanity and the environment.""  The report urges swift action to reverse the damage and create a ""green"" economy that is based on sustainable practices.  In the report's ""ecosystems at risk"" section, the authors identify more than 180 wildlands and habitats that are in danger of disappearing because of human activity.  ""The loss of these vital ecosystems would result in significant reductions in the quality of life for many people and seriously undermine efforts to combat climate change,"" the authors say.']",

Now, I find myself needing to share my experiences with other women in prison so that we can build support networks and create a safe space to speak out.  The first time I was incarcerated, I was so scared and alone. I didn't know how to make friends or how to cope with the stress of being away from my family.  I was lucky enough to find a group of women who were also new to prison. We would talk, share stories, and build each other up.  Now, it's important for me to stay connected to these women. We're the only family I have left.  Talking to other women in prison has helped me to cope with my experiences and to find allies.  We can share advice, support, and encouragement. And, most importantly, we can remind each other that we're not alone in our experiences.  I feel so grateful for the safe space that writing has created for me. It's given me a chance to process my experiences and to communicate my feelings to others.  Writing has also allowed me to connect with people outside of prison, through social media sites like Twitter.

Quindlen, who's in her 70s, was one of more than 1,000 residents of Castlewood Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility who went without power in temperatures that topped 100 degrees on July 13, 2011.

In fact, it's quite the opposite. Duct tape is incredible for fixing things, but it's not the most ideal material for making Temporary bonds.   Why?  Well, duct tape is made up of very strong, adhesive strips that are tightly bound together. This means that if you try to pull or stretch it too much, it will tear.

153,Stopping the opioid crisis in the womb,"['A New York Times op-ed by Dr. Karen De Coster, a perinatal psychiatrist and associate professor at Yale University School of Medicine, argues that stopping the opioid crisis in the womb is the key to preventing it from spreading to future generations.  “Opioids are not just killing adults. The crisis is killing children, too,” De Coster writes. “Nearly two thirds of opioid overdose fatalities in children are attributed to opioids.”  De Coster cites a study published in The Lancet that found that when compared to children who didn’t grow up with a mother who used opioids, those who did were three times as likely to use illicit drugs and alcohol, and were twice as likely to have a mental health disorder.  “One way to prevent the devastating opioid crisis from continuing to ravage families is to effectively address the root cause: addiction,” De Coster writes. “Prevention starts in the womb.”  One of the essential pieces to solving the opioid crisis is to prevent people from getting addicted in the first place. Unfortunately, there is evidence that many people develop an opioid addiction while still in the womb.  Studies have found that exposure to opioids in the womb increases the risk of developing an opioid addiction later in life. This is likely because exposure to opioids during development can cause changes in the brain that increase the risk of developing a addiction.  If you are pregnant, it is important to talk to your doctor about your risk of developing an opioid addiction. You can also talk to your doctor about whether or not you should take opioid painkillers during pregnancy.  If you are pregnant and are using opioids, it is important to get help. You can call 1-800-662-HELP to get help finding addiction treatment programs.']",

This increase was seen in both those who identified as Republican and those who identified as Independent, and it was greatest in those who said they “strongly” benefited.

At the same time, the percentage of Strong Trump supporters who say they support ACA has decreased from 54 percent to 41 percent.

On Tuesday, October 17, The Washington Post released a poll that found that Trump's approval rating had surged to 45 percent, with disapproval at 52 percent. This increase in approval is likely due to the Republican's successful efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The poll showed that Trump's support was nearly twice that of the next highest candidate, Hillary Clinton, with 41 percent of those polled approving of Trump while her support was at 24 percent. The next highest candidate was Sen. Bernie Sanders, who had 18 percent of support.

156,Understanding why a visa can be so coveted and reviled,"['A visa is a document that allows someone to enter a country. They can be coveted for many reasons. First, they can be coveted for their ability to allow people to travel to different countries. They can also be coveted for their ability to allow people to work in different countries. Lastly, they can be coveted for their ability to allow people to stay in a country for a specific amount of time.  A visa is coveted and reviled for a variety of reasons. The most obvious reason is that a visa is a required component of traveling to many countries. Without a valid visa, an individual cannot travel to, or enter, a country. This can be a major inconvenience, particularly if an individual is traveling for work or for educational purposes.  Another reason why a visa can be so coveted is that a visa can be a means of entering the country illegally. Many people view a visa as a way to gain an advantage in competition for jobs, housing, and other opportunities. Those who are able to obtain a visa often have an advantage over those who are not authorized to enter the country.  Finally, a visa can be coveted simply because it is a form of privilege. Many people view a visa as a sign that they are worthy of preferential treatment. This can make it difficult for people who do not have a valid visa to obtain one.  There is no straightforward answer to this question as visa policies can vary widely from country to country. However, some possible reasons why visas can be so coveted and reviled include:  -They allow people to travel to foreign countries and explore new cultures -They provide a safe and secure way to travel -They allow people to work and study in foreign countries -They allow people to reunite with family members']",
157,From Gandhi to guns: An Indian woman at the NRA,"['Gun violence is not endemic to the United States. The highest rates of homicide are found in countries like India, where firearms are common and often used without conviction.  I am an Indian woman, and I am against gun violence. Guns are not intrinsic to my culture and heritage. They are not the tools of my ancestors.  In my home country of India, firearms are used extensively in robbery, homicide, and suicide. The guns are not owned by the governments or by the people; they are owned by gangs and criminals.  I am proud to be against gun violence in the United States. I urge all Americans, regardless of their views on guns, to join me in calling for a comprehensive and effective response to gun violence that includes more effective measures to prevent and punish violence, better mental health care and treatment, and stricter gun control laws.  Gandhi addresses the National Rifle Association (NRA) in an attempt to show that firearms are not just for sport, but can also be used for self-defense.  ""The evil of using firearms for murder or hurt is not confined to any country or period. It is as old as civilization.""  ""Firearms can only be used for legitimate purposes - to protect the lives of people. They cannot be used to slaughter animals for food, to destroy property for monetary gain, or to intimidate or terrorize others.""  ""In any battle between truth and falsehood, truth will always triumph."" convention  “It’s interesting to me that in India, we have the world’s largest democracy and we have the world’s largest number of women in parliament, and yet we don’t have the world’s largest number of women owning guns,” said Meenakshi Lekhi, an Indian political analyst and member of the India Foundation.  But, Lekhi continued, that does not mean Indians do not want guns. “In India, gun ownership is not about repression but about protection,” she said. “Guns are not only for the military; they are for farmers and protectors of cattle.”']",

161,How ordinary people become 'white supremacists by default',"['In some cases, people may not be aware of their white supremacist beliefs until they are confronted with social or professional consequences. In other cases, people may have held white supremacist beliefs for some time without actively promoting them.  The term ""by default"" is used here to describe a situation in which a person's white supremacist beliefs are assumed or implied based on their racist actions or affiliations. This can occur without the person being aware of it, in the context of a social or professional setting.  Some factors that can lead to a person's white supremacist beliefs being by default assumed include:  - Having a racist background - Showing racist or inflammatory behavior - Being affiliated with or supporting white supremacist groups or individuals - Having links to white supremacist ideology  In most cases, individuals who hold white supremacist beliefs are not representative of the entire white population. However, because white supremacists often promote extremist views and actions, they can become a default representation of white people in certain contexts.  The Southern Poverty Law Center defines white supremacists as people who ""believe that white Europeans are superior to all other races and that white racial identity is essential to national glory.""  Because white supremacists espouse beliefs that are broadly acceptable and even popular in some parts of the United States, these individuals can easy slip into becoming ""white supremacists by default.""  These individuals may harbor prejudices against certain minority groups without realizing it, or they may hear others espousing these beliefs without disapprovingly challenging them.  If these individuals feel left out or marginalized because of their race, they may begin to view other minority groups in a negative light and develop a belief that they are superior to these groups.']",
162,Get ready for a more militant and 'woke' NAACP,"['The NAACP has always been a militant organization, but it is gearing up for a more militant and ""woke"" era.  NAACP President Derrick Johnson said the organization is ready to stand up to discrimination and fight for civil rights.  ""Our advocacy work is not done and our resolve to fight for justice is stronger than ever,"" Johnson said in a statement.  The NAACP held a summit in Philadelphia earlier this year to discuss ways to combat discrimination and violence against black people.  Johnson said the summit was successful in raising awareness about the issues and encouraging people to get involved.  The NAACP plans to hold more similar summits in the future.  The NAACP is poised to undergo a more militant and ""woke"" phase, which could mean increased activism focused on issues such as police brutality and institutional racism.  According to The Root, the NAACP's national board of directors is set to discuss a new strategic plan this weekend that could see the group become more engaged in policymaking and electoral politics.  The NAACP has already increased its spending on advocacy and political consulting in recent years, and the new plan could see the group double down on its efforts to elect Democrats and challenge social and economic injustices.  Some board members reportedly want the NAACP to become more vocal in protests and demonstrations against police brutality and racism, and to take a more activist stance on issues such as voter rights and income inequality.  Some longtime NAACP members are concerned that the group is shifting too far away from its mission of fighting for civil rights, and they worry that the new strategic plan will result in the organization losing its credibility and membership.  The NAACP has been embroiled in controversy in recent years over its relationship with the Black Lives Matter movement and its endorsement of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election.']",
163,The first time I realized I was black,"['It was during elementary school when someone called me a ""blackberry"" and everyone in the room started laughing. It felt like they were ridiculing me, and it made my skin crawl. This wasn't the first time that someone had used that term to describe me, but it was the first time it had made me feel uncomfortable. was when I was about four years old. I remember my mother taking me to the drugstore and telling me to pick out a coloring book. I selected one with black and white people in it, and I started coloring in the people with black skin.  I loved the way the color felt on my hands and I loved how it made the people in the book look so different from the people in the other coloring books. I never thought to question why the people in the other coloring books were all white, but the color of my skin made me feel like I was different.  It wasn't until much later that I began to understand that I was black because of the color of my skin, and not because of who my parents were or what I looked like.  Growing up, I often felt like I had to hide my blackness. I wasn't allowed to wear a lot of makeup or dye my hair any different colors, and I always felt like I had to be careful not to make anyone uncomfortable.  It was only after I started college and started to mix more with people from different backgrounds that I started to feel more comfortable being myself.  Now, I feel like being black is something that enrichs my life and makes me who I am.  There's nothing I wouldn't do to protect the black community, and I will always stand up for them in any way I can.  I hope that one day, everyone will be able to feel the same way about their blackness, and that we can all be together in harmony.']",

An increasing number of people are feeling unsafe in their own neighborhoods, according to a recent study by the National Safety Council.  Council research showed that in 2017, there were an estimated 10.3 million people who reported feeling unsafe in their neighborhoods. That's up from 9.1 million in 2016 and 6.3 million in 2010.  The council says the increase may be due to a range of factors, including the opioid crisis, crime, and poor quality of life.  ""Everyone has a right to feel safe in their community,"" said Deborah Hersman, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. ""Our survey found that many people are struggling to feel safe, in part because of the increased crime and violence. We need to work together to make sure everyone has a safe place to call home.""  The National Safety Council says there are ways to feel safe in your community:  Report any crimes or safety concerns to your local police department.  Stay informed about crime and safety alerts in your community.  Hang out with trusted friends and family in well-lit areas.  Report suspicious activities to 911.  Register with the National Safety Council to receive safety alerts and safety resources.  A recent poll found that a majority of Americans do not feel safe in their neighborhoods. The poll was conducted by The Harris Poll and surveyed 1,000 adults across the U.S. It found that 61% of U.S. adults do not feel safe walking in their neighborhoods at night. Additionally, 56% of Americans do not feel safe when they are driving in their neighborhoods at night.

In the early days of the polio vaccine, many people were excited about the prospect of a polio-free world. But within a few years, it was clear that this was not going to happen overnight.  Poverty, lack of access to health care, and instability all contribute to the spread of polio. Many of the countries where polio is most common are also very poor and have weak health systems.  It's still possible to achieve a polio-free world. But it's going to take a lot of hard work, and there's no guarantee that it will ever happen.  Crawling can help protect a person from polio. There is still a risk of contracting the virus while travelling, but by crawling, people can help reduce the risk.  A polio-free country is one where there have not been any confirmed cases of polio in over a year.']",
175,Giving a face to Sudan's refugee crisis,"['There is no single face to Sudan's refugee crisis, as refugees from all over the country have fled to neighbouring countries. However, there are many Sudanese refugees who have been forced to flee their homes due to the ongoing conflict in the country. Most Sudanese refugees are women and children who have risked their lives to escape the violence and persecution that they face at home.  Sudanese refugees often face extreme difficulties in finding safety and security in new countries. Many refugees are forced to live in cramped and unsanitary conditions, and are at risk of exploitation and human rights abuses. Sudanese refugees also face significant challenges in finding work and integrating into their new communities. However, despite the challenges, many refugees are determined to build new lives for themselves and their families.  Sudanese refugee children wait for an appointment with a UNHCR representative in a camp in Darfur, Sudan, in 2013.  Maha al-Din is a mother of six who fled Sudan's Darfur region in 2012. She has now been displaced four times and has not seen her children in over two years. Maha is one of the millions of refugees fleeing Sudan's bloody civil war.  The face of Sudan's refugee crisis is disproportionately young and female. The majority of refugees are children, women and the elderly – who are often forced to leave their homes in search of safety.  Refugees are also often forced to leave behind all of their belongings, including their homes, belongings, and even their family members. This can be incredibly traumatic for them and their families.  Many refugees are also living in camps and are unable to return home due to the ongoing violence in Sudan.']",

177,Schools knew of trouble before student deaths,"['The Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office released a report on Wednesday that school systems in Somerset County knew about prior incidents of violence and threats against students prior to the deaths of 16-year-old Jack Pinto and 14-year-old Aaron Fisher.  According to the report, Somerset County Assistant Prosecutor Meg McQuaig presented findings from an investigation into the Oct. 25, 2018, deaths of the two students at Great Mills High School.  “The investigations revealed that the schools knew about prior incidents of violence and threats against students, but did not take appropriate action to protect the students,” McQuaig said in a statement.  The investigation revealed that school staff received a threat against Fisher on Sept. 26, 2018, and a warning about a potential threat against Pinto on Oct. 16, 2018.  The prosecutor’s office also released a timeline of events leading up to the deaths:  September 26: A threat is received against Fisher.  October 16: A warning is received about a potential threat against Pinto.  October 18: Pinto and Fisher are killed.  October 25: The bodies of Pinto and Fisher are discovered.  Schools knew there might be trouble with their students, but they didn't know there would be fatalities. In fact, the families of the students killed in the shootings in Parkland, Florida, have said that the school district should have done more to protect them.  The day before the deadliest school shooting in United States history, a sheriff’s department in Texas received a tip that there might be something amiss at a school in the town of Santa Fe.  But the school district didn’t take the warning seriously and didn’t send any officers to the school.  The shooting that took place on May 18, 2018, left 10 people dead and 10 more injured.']",

The videos that have sparked outrage across the United States show Planned Parenthood executives discussing the sale of fetal tissue. But the real story behind those videos is a lot worse than what conservatives are claiming. The videos are actually just a tiny fraction of the evidence that suggest Planned Parenthood is engaged in illegal activity.  For years, Planned Parenthood has been caught selling fetal tissue — a practice that is illegal under federal law. In congressional testimony last year, Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards admitted that the organization sells fetal tissue, but she claimed that the money from the sales goes towards providing women's health services. But that isn't the only evidence that suggests Planned Parenthood is engaged in illegal activity.  In 2015, Live Action released a video that showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetal body parts. That video was also caught on tape, and it shows Planned Parenthood officials discussing how to alter abortion procedures to maximize the sale of fetal body parts.  And this isn't the only evidence of Planned Parenthood's shady dealings. In 2013, the organization was caught selling baby body parts through a clandestine tissue procurement scheme.  So, while the videos that have sparked outrage show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue, the real story is much worse. Planned Parenthood is engaged in illegal activity, and conservatives are right to be outraged.']",
179,Sources: Disabled work program mired in fraud,"[', waste  Disabled work program mired in fraud, waste  Officials with the state’s disabled work program say there has been rampant fraud and waste within the program.  The New Hampshire Department of Labor reported that between January and June of this year, the program paid out nearly $270,000 to ineligible recipients.  In addition, the department says it has recovered almost $100,000 in fraudulent payments since 2006.  Officials say the program is failing to provide meaningful work opportunities for disabled residents.  The disabled work program, designed to help the disabled find employment, is rife with fraud and abuse, The New York Times reports.  The program has paid out nearly $1 billion in grants and benefits since it was established in the 1970s, but many of the recipients have not worked and some have used the money to buy cars and homes.  Investigators have found evidence of fraud in nearly every state where the program is active, and one study found that as much as one-third of all money paid out through the program is unaccounted for.  The program has been heavily criticized by Congress, which has called for an investigation into the wrongdoing.  The federal government’s disabled work program is mired in fraud, according to a report released last week.  The report, by the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, found that the disabled work program paid out more in benefits than it collected in taxes between 2009 and 2012.  The program provides tax credits and other benefits to people with disabilities who are unable to find employment.  The report found that people who were supposed to be receiving benefits were instead using the money to buy drugs or alcohol.  In some cases, people were also claiming benefits for people who did not have disabilities.  The program has been plagued by fraud for years, but the Department of Labor has not done enough to stop it, the report said.  “Although the Department of Labor aggressively enforces the law, it has not done enough to ensure that benefits are awarded to eligible individuals and that program funds are being used properly,” the report said.']",

Three current and former University of Illinois athletes have alleged in a federal lawsuit that they were subjected to physical and emotional abuse by Head Coach John Groce and athletic director Ron Zook, as well as racism from coaches and staff.  The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Urbana, seeks monetary damages for loss of income, pain and suffering, and other unspecified damages.  The athletes, who are black, allege that Groce called them ""yard dogs,"" "" animals,"" and other derogatory terms; that he would punish them with extended workouts in the heat or cold; and that Zook would ridicule their performances or lack thereof.  According to the lawsuit, which also names the university as a defendant, the abuse began in 2014, when Groce was named head coach, and continued through the end of Groce's tenure in 2018.  “Coach Groce and AD Zook ignored our concerns and routinely subjected us to physical and emotional abuse,” said Torre Hunt, one of the athletes involved in the lawsuit. “Our desire to achieve our athletic goals was continually put in jeopardy by these individuals. We hope that this lawsuit will help us get the justice that we deserve.”  Hunt, a midfielder on the men's soccer team from 2013-2018, is joined in the lawsuit by forwards Kwame Awuah and D’Andre Walker, both of whom played for the Fighting Illini from 2016-2018.

WASHINGTON — It’s not over.  Veterans are still waiting months for appointments at some VA medical centers despite promises to fix the system.  Nearly 600,000 veterans nationwide have been waiting more than 30 days for an appointment, according to the latest data from the VA. That’s more than double the number of veterans who had to wait more than 90 days in 2017.  The problems started in 2014, when the VA promised to improve wait times for appointments for veterans. But the delays continue.  In the last quarter of 2018, the VA had to reschedule appointments for veterans more than 1.5 million times. The agency rescheduled appointments for a total of 9.1 million times in the past three years.  VA Secretary David Shulkin said the growing wait times are a sign that the VA is “doing better.”  “I want to be clear. This is not good enough,” Shulkin said.  The agency has already started to change some of its processes in an attempt to speed up the appointment process.  For example, veterans will now have the option to schedule an appointment online.

In this scam, criminals pose as representatives of the IRS and attempt to extract money from unsuspecting victims by threatening legal action or claiming refund fraud. The IRS does not initiate legal proceedings or send collectors to pressure people for money without having first obtained a court order.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scam is costing victims $15 million per month, according to a report released by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  The FTC report found that individuals who fall victim to the IRS scam are often asked to pay taxes that they did not actually owe in order to resolve a dispute with the IRS. Additionally, many victims are tricked into transferring money to scammers through fake IRS notifications or emails.  “The IRS scam is one of the most popular scams in the country and is costing innocent people millions of dollars each month,” said FTC Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen. “To prevent this crime from happening, be aware of the warning signs and don’t trust anyone who claims to be from the IRS.”  The FTC report provides a list of some of the common warning signs of a scam involving the IRS:  You are asked to pay taxes you don’t actually owe.  You are asked to make a payment to resolve a dispute with the IRS.  You receive a demand for money that you didn’t expect or think you would have to pay.  You are offered a deal that seems too good to be true.  You are threatened with legal action if you don’t pay the scammer.

189,The truth about the white working class,"['There is no one definitive answer to this question. Some people believe that the white working class is actually Doing Better Than Ever, while others believe that the white working class is in a lot of trouble. There is no one right answer.  There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the white working class experiences different levels of hardship and struggle depending on where they live and what jobs they hold. However, some general trends can be observed in the white working class.  Firstly, the white working class is often considered to be one of the most economically disadvantaged groups in the United States. This is in part due to the fact that white working-class families earn relatively low wages and have a high rate of unemployment and poverty.  Secondly, the white working class is disproportionately affected by economic recession and crisis. This was clearly evident during the recent financial crisis, when the white working class was significantly more likely than other groups to lose their jobs and homes.  Finally, the white working class often experiences a high level of social and emotional stress. This is due to the fact that white working-class people are more likely than other groups to face economic hardship, social isolation, and mental health issues.  The white working class is a demographic that is often misunderstood. While some white working class people have incomes that are low enough that they qualify for government assistance, many others are successful and hold jobs that are considered middle-class or upper-middle-class.  The white working class is made up of people who have jobs that are manual or labor-intensive, such as construction, manufacturing, farming, and food service. This group is often criticized for being low-income, but the reality is that a large number of white working class people are actually middle-income or above.  The white working class is also often associated with poverty and a lack of education, but that is not always the case. While white working class people do tend to have lower levels of education than people in other socioeconomic groups, a large number of white working class people have at least a high school diploma.  The white working class is a diverse group, and the attitudes and experiences of individual members can vary greatly. While some white working class people may feel marginalized and exploited, others may feel proud of their working class background and enjoy the camaraderie that arises from shared experiences.']",
190,2016: Last call for working class whites?,"['There is no last call for working class whites in America.  US working class whites have been hit especially hard by economic changes in recent years, with many unemployed or struggling to make ends meet. This may be the last chance for many to get ahead, and some are worried that the trend will continue and working class whites will become a minority.  By 2024, there may be no more white working class Americans. This is according to a study released by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) that looked at data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) between 2008 and 2016.  The study found that the share of white working class adults in the US has dropped precipitously since 2008, from 42% to 33%. ""The decline in the share of white working-class adults is almost entirely the result of a decline in the share of white working-class women,"" the report found.  ""The share of white working-class men has not changed substantially since 2008, and is slightly higher now than it was in 2001. However, if current trends continue, the share of white working-class men is likely to drop below 30% by 2024.""  The fall in the white working class is particularly pronounced when compared to other social groups. The share of white working-class adults has fallen by 9 percentage points while the share of black working-class adults has fallen by just 2 percentage points, and the share of Latino working-class adults has fallen by 3 percentage points.  The EPI study says that this trend is likely the result of ""more recent economic pressures"" faced by white working-class Americans, including decreases in wages and benefits, stagnant or declining real incomes, and rising costs of healthcare, housing, and education.  The study says that the decline of the white working class is ""of particular concern"" because it ""represents a growing and long-standing challenge to the economic security and social cohesion of America's working class.""']",

White working-class evangelicals are a largely conservative Christian group in the United States, who are often the most conservative Christians in America. They are often less educated and poorer than other Christians, and they are sometimes seen as being a target market for Republican Party campaigns.

They are also concerned about the impact that immigration has on the United States, and they feel that the country is being turned into a multicultural society that is not reflective of the values of traditional American Christians.   Many white working-class evangelicals feel that their voices are not being heard by mainstream American Christians, and they are seeking to build a network of like-minded Christians who can lobby for their concerns.

192,The shell-shocked white working class,"['The white working class is a working class category in the United States. It includes people who work in white-collar or blue-collar jobs.  The white working class has undergone a significant decline in its share of the American workforce since the end of World War II. It had been the majority class in the U.S. by the 1970s, but it has since lost significant ground to other groups, including the black working class and the Latino working class. According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2014 the white working class comprised less than half of all workers in the country.   The decline of the white working class is often seen as a result of various factors, including the rise of technology and globalization, the economic recession of the late 2000s, and policies pursued by the Obama administration, such as the Affordable Care Act and the stimulus program. of America  The white working class of America is a group of people who are typically middle or lower class and have jobs that are mostly manual labor. They lost a lot of their jobs and wealth during the recession, and they are still struggling to get back on their feet. in America  The shell-shocked white working class in America is a term used to describe the reaction of the white working class in America to the rise of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump's victory was seen as a shocking upset, and many in the white working class felt betrayed by his policies.  The term has been used to describe the feelings of anger, disillusionment, and anxiety that many in the white working class are experiencing following Trump's victory.']",
193,West Virginia's 'forgotten tribe', why the white working class feels left behind,"['The white working class feels left behind in America. Some blame it on feeling marginalized by economic elites, educational institutions and the media, but there is another force at work. White working-class Americans feel forgotten by their government and by those who claim to care about them.  In West Virginia, working-class whites feel especially disconnected. The state has the lowest median household income and the third-highest poverty rate in the country. Nearly one-third of West Virginians live below the poverty line, and the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.  The economy has not been kind to West Virginians in recent years. Coal mining, which once provided a steady stream of jobs, has become increasingly automated. The state's economy has also been hurt by the decline in the price of coal and the rise of oil and gas drilling.  The white working class in West Virginia has been hit particularly hard by these changes. Manufacturing, which used to be a major employer in the state, has also been declining. As a result, many white working-class West Virginians have lost their jobs and have had to turn to lower-paying sectors of the economy.  West Virginia is not the only state where the white working class has felt left behind. In fact, surveys have consistently shown that white working-class Americans feel that they are economically disadvantaged relative to their counterparts in other races.  This sense of economic isolation is particularly acute in states like West Virginia, where there is a strong sense of cultural difference between the white working class and the elites who dominate the state's politics and economy.  For the white working class, feeling forgotten has its roots in economic hardship and the sense of isolation that comes from living in a state that is not only economically struggling but also culturally different from their peers. It is an issue that is likely to continue to be a critical concern for policymakers and advocates working to improve the socioeconomic conditions of white working-class Americans.']"

Fifty-six percent of white working-class Americans say they have a mostly positive view of Muslims in the U.S., while 35 percent say they have a mostly negative view. But roughly half of white working-class Americans (51 percent) say they have a somewhat positive view of Muslims, while another 29 percent say they have a somewhat negative view.  Only about a third of white working-class Americans (34 percent) say they have a very positive view of Muslims, while about a fifth (19 percent) say they have a very negative view.  Just over a third of white working-class Americans (36 percent) say they feel that Muslims pose a threat to the U.S., while about a fourth (27 percent) say they feel that Muslims are not a threat.

195,"Working class whites blame Washington, but still want more government help","['In both the 2010 and 2014 elections, white working-class voters responded to Democratic candidates’ pitches for more government intervention by giving their votes to candidates who promised to increase spending on social programs. But while many of these same voters continue to believe that Washington is responsible for their problems, they also want the government to do more to help them.  In a 2016 survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, a majority of white working-class respondents (60%) said that government should do more to help needy people, even if that means increasing taxes. Just over a third (35%) said government should do less, and just 3% said that government should do nothing.  Similarly, in an analysis of exit polls from the 2016 election, Vox found that while Trump won the support of 67% of white voters without a college degree, he actually lost the overall vote to Clinton by about 3 million votes, or 2 percentage points. Nearly half of these voters (48%)said they wanted the government to do more to help people in need, while only about a third (37%) said they wanted the government to do less.  There is a reason why white working class people have a negative view of government. They have experienced the negative side effects of government intervention firsthand. For example, they have seen their taxes increase as a result of government programs designed to help people in need. Or they have seen their jobs go away because of government regulation. Or they have seen their neighborhoods become crime-ridden because of government spending on programs like the police.  Despite these negative experiences, many white working class people still want more government help. This is because they believe that government intervention is the only way to solve the problems that they face. White working class people believe that the government can do a better job than the private sector of creating jobs, providing welfare benefits, and fighting crime.  These negative experiences have convinced many white working class people that government is a bad way to manage our economy and our society. However, they still want more government help because they believe that it is the only way to solve the problems that they face.']",

Many are struggling with long-term unemployment and poverty. They feel left behind by globalization and are angry about the erosion of traditional values.  To make matters worse, many in this demographic feel that their leaders in Washington don’t understand or care about them. They see Donald Trump as a man who speaks their language and is committed to restoring their faith in America.  His policies, which include restoring jobs and economic growth, lifting restrictions on energy production, and cracking down on illegal immigration, resonated with these voters. They believed that he would bring back the jobs they’ve lost and make their lives better.  Less educated whites are also a key part of Trump’s support base. They are angry about the decline of the working class and feel that their voices aren’t being heard. They feel that Donald Trump will give them a voice and fight for their interests.  His policies on education, which include improving access to quality education and reeling in government spending, are important to these voters. They believe that he will make their lives better by providing them with better opportunities.  1. They live in suburbs or rural areas.  2. They are white, Christian, and working-class.  3. They typically have a high school diploma or less.  4. They are often opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage.  5. They are likely to support Donald Trump.

Working class whites typically have lower incomes and greater exposure to economic hardship than other groups in the U.S. These disparities are especially pronounced for whites without a college degree. However, despite these challenges, many working class whites report that they are doing OK. This sentiment is likely motivated in part by personal resilience and a strong belief in the American Dream.

207,Workers fight for rights at 'ground zero for US slavery',"['By Danica Kirka  16 November 2013  Workers in the Brooklyn Navy Yard are fighting for their rights to refuse dangerous and unsafe work, to organize and to have a voice on the job.  The yard, which is located in New York City's waterfront district of Brooklyn, is the ""ground zero"" for the US slave labor system, according to the WSWS. This is because it is one of the largest naval construction yards in the US and is home to a large number of workers who are employed by subcontractors.  The workers are employed on a temporary and contract basis, making them vulnerable to exploitation by their employers and the expectation of being fired at any time. They are also paid very low wages, making it difficult for them to make ends meet.  In response to the growing militancy of the workers, the yard's management has launched a series of attacks. First, it accused the workers of deliberately slowing down work, a charge that was later disproven. Then, the management introduced a new contract that eliminated most of the benefits that the workers had been fighting for, including a minimum wage and health and safety benefits.  The contracts adopted by the US naval yards are nothing new. They are designed to slash costs and reduce the workers' collective bargaining power.  In recent months, the workers have been battling the contractor that employs them, the Louis Berger Group (LGB), for the right to form a union.   Berger has refused to recognize the union, claiming that it does not have enough support from the workforce. The workers are demanding that Berger recognize the union and bargain collectively with it, in a fight for improved conditions and the right to form a trade union.  However, the workers are encountering resistance from the management and the unions.  Last week, the yard's workers went on strike for a day, protesting the introduction of the new contract and LGB's refusal to recognize the union. Around 100 workers attended a rally outside the yard on Friday, November 11, denouncing the attacks on their conditions and calling for the right to form a union, a minimum wage of $15 per hour and health and safety protections.

208,Slave-free chocolate: a not-so-guilty pleasure,"['I’ve always been a big fan of chocolate. I love the taste, the aroma, and the way it makes me feel. However, I have never been a big fan of the slavery-based chocolate production process.  For centuries, cocoa beans have been harvested by slave labor. This means that farmers in developing countries exploit poor and vulnerable people to extract cocoa beans from the cocoa tree. This labor-based process is incredibly destructive and can result in the exploitation and death of those who work in the cocoa industry.  Thankfully, the modern chocolate industry is starting to change. There are now many brands that are committed to using slave-free cocoa beans. This means that the cocoa beans are not harvested using the forced labor of poor, vulnerable people.  This is a big step forward, and I am grateful for it. I hope that others will join me in supporting this movement and ensuring that slavery-based chocolate production is no longer acceptable.

If you want to enjoy chocolate without supporting slavery, there are a few ways to do so.  Some people choose to buy chocolate that is ethically sourced. This means that the chocolate was made without using slave labor. Some other people choose to make their own chocolate at home. This can be done by using cacao beans that have been ethically sourced, or by using chocolate that has been made with ethically sourced ingredients.  If you want to support slavery, you can still enjoy chocolate. You can buy chocolate that is made with slave labor, or you can buy chocolate that is not made with slave labor but has been produced in a way that is detrimental to the environment.']",

The workers are from various parts of Brazil, and many of them are in their early twenties. They are paid a fraction of the minimum wage, and they are often subjected to physical and sexual abuse.  The cattle ranches are operated by members of the country's powerful political and business elite. They are exempt from many of the country's labour laws, and they are able to avoid paying taxes.  It is estimated that the ranches generate a annual revenue of more than $1billion.  Thousands of indigenous people have been forced to work on cattle ranches in Brazil, according to a report by the indigenous rights group Survival International.  The organisation said that the ranches are located in areas that are home to indigenous people and that the workers are often paid extremely low wages.  Survival International said that the workers are often forced to live in poverty and are at risk of being exploited or even trafficked.  In a statement, Survival International said that the Brazilian government should take action to stop the exploitation of the workers and to protect the rights of the indigenous people.']",

Cambodia is one of the world's poorest countries, and its children are some of the poorest. Many work in the brick kilns, where the risk of fire, exploitation, and injury is high.  The kilns are often in dangerous and uncleaned places, and the kiln workers are often very poor. They are not protected by laws or by the manufacturers themselves.  There are efforts to improve conditions for the kiln workers, but they need more support. are often exposed to hazardous materials and lack appropriate safety equipment.

In many areas of the world, people still work in dangerous and often unhealthy conditions. Brick kilns are one of these workplaces. Children working in these kilns are often the poorest and most vulnerable members of society.  Brick kilns are often located in areas with poor air quality. The kilns use large amounts of harmful chemicals to produce bricks, which can lead to respiratory problems, eye injuries, and other health problems.  Most of the children working in brick kilns are from rural areas of Cambodia. They are often recruited by family members or local traffickers. The children often have little education or experience working in a formal setting.  Children working in brick kilns often have little exposure to opportunities for education or employment. They are often paid very low wages, which barely cover the cost of food and basic necessities.  It is important for the government of Cambodia to create policies that will improve the lives of these children.

211,The girls sold for sex by their mothers,"['There is no one answer to this question as the girls who are sold for sex by their mothers can vary drastically in terms of age, location, and reasons for being sold. However, some common themes that are seen in these cases include poverty, abuse, and a lack of opportunities for young women.  It is important to remember that child sexual exploitation is not simply a problem that affects girls whose mothers sell them for sex. It is also a problem that affects boys and men, and can happen within any socio-economic background.  If you are concerned that a family member may be involved in the sexual exploitation of a child, it is important to reach out for help. There are many agencies available to help survivors of child sexual exploitation, and it can be a very difficult and traumatic experience to come to terms with.  Child prostitution is a problem of global proportions, affecting children from all walks of life. Many girls become involved in prostitution because of poverty, social stigma, and coercion from their parents or other authority figures. Others are tricked or forced into the trade by criminals or pimps who promise a better life.  Child prostitution is most rampant in countries in crisis, such as Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Thailand. Authorities in those countries are often powerless to stop the exploitation of children because of the extreme poverty and political instability that pervade these regions.  In the United States, child prostitution is not as widespread as it is in other parts of the world, but it is still an issue. Reports estimate that there are between 12,000 and 18,000 child prostitutes in the United States. The majority of these minors are from the poorest neighborhoods in major cities.  It is estimated that the total cost of child prostitution in the United States is $32 million a year. This includes the cost of law enforcement, social services, and health care.']",

Queen Elizabeth postponed several engagements Wednesday as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread.  The queen had been scheduled to visit a children's hospital during her visit to Bahrain Wednesday, but the visit has been postponed.  Earlier in the day, the queen had been scheduled to attend a Trooping the Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace, but that too has been postponed.

Queen Elizabeth postponed engagements on Saturday due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Queen Elizabeth II has postponed engagements, including a state visit to Japan, until after the coronavirus pandemic has ended, Buckingham Palace said Sunday.  The Royal visit, which was to have taken place in April, is now expected in early May, the palace said in a statement.  ""The queen has decided that now is not the time for an official state visit by Her Majesty to Japan,"" the palace said.  ""While the queen is confident that the Japanese people are well able to deal with this situation, she believes it is important to defer the visit until the situation has stabilised.""

The 36-year-old actor and musician released the highly personal project, which tells the story of relationships and breakups, over the weekend. He wrote and directed the film, which is available to watch on his website.  ""This album is about growing up, and all the ways we try to find our way in the world,"" he wrote on the website. ""It's about the ties that bind us, and the ones that eventually just pull us apart. It's about the hope and the disappointment that comes with trying to make something of ourselves. It's about love, loss, and endurance.""  The album, which is also available on Spotify, was inspired by Ahmed's own personal experiences.

216,A trade deal with America will not compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits,"['This is not an accurate representation of the position of the UK Government. The UK has been clear that it wants a trade deal with America that is equivalent in value to the benefits the UK gets from membership of the EU. This will not be easy to achieve, but it is something the UK is determined to achieve.  There is no one ""trade deal"" with America – different agreements will be in place for different sectors of the economy. Britain will lose out on the benefits of access to the EU's single market, but could benefit from more favourable trade deals with other countries.  There is no guarantee that a trade deal with America will compensate Britain for the loss of EU benefits. While a trade deal with America could be beneficial in some ways, it is likely that it would also result in the loss of many of the benefits that Britain currently receives from the EU. For example, a trade deal with America could mean that Britain would no longer have access to the EU's free trade area, which would result in significant losses for the UK economy.  This claim is false.  If the UK did not join the EU, it would still be able to trade with America and receive the same benefits as it does now from the EU. For example, British citizens would still be able to live and work in America, and the UK would continue to be part of the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union.']",
217,No-deal Brexit is back -- and it looks more likely than ever,"['British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing mounting pressure to come up with a compromise plan that would keep the UK in the European Union.  A referendum on a no-deal Brexit is back on the table, after the Labour Party and the Conservative Party agreed to put the issue to a vote in Parliament.  The agreement comes after months of negotiations between the two parties, and after Prime Minister Theresa May was warned that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for the UK economy.  Many experts have warned that a no-deal Brexit would cause major disruptions to the UK's economy, including a sharp rise in food and fuel prices, a shortage of medical supplies, and a loss of jobs.  The referendum question is currently unknown, but it is possible that it would ask voters whether they support a no-deal Brexit.  If the referendum were to take place, and voters were to reject a no-deal Brexit, then the UK would most likely remain in the European Union.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May appears to be close to a deal with the European Union that would allow the country to leave the bloc without a deal, according to media reports.  Brexit is back on the table.  The chances of a no-deal Brexit are now more likely than ever, after Theresa May's Chequers plan was rejected by her own MPs on Monday. With just over two weeks until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, there is still time for a resolution, but it seems increasingly unlikely.

218,UK courts will now livestream divorce proceedings,"['The High Court of England and Wales will now livestream divorce proceedings for people who cannot make it to court.  From 1 July 2018, Australian courts will livestream divorce proceedings. This will make it easier for couples to connect and resolve their issues in a way that is comfortable for them.    The Royal Courts of Justice in the United Kingdom will now livestream divorce proceedings, in an effort to make the process more user-friendly for both parties.  The trial of the livestreaming, which will be available to the public for free, is being pioneered by the Family Division of the High Court of Justice.  Judge Emma Arbuthnot, who is leading the trial, told the BBC that the livestream “will make it easier for the parties, who can see and hear what is happening in the courtroom, and for thechildren, who can see and hear their parents discussing their divorce.”  She added that the trials “will also increase public understanding of family law and how it works.”  The trial is scheduled to begin on March 1st and will last for six weeks.  In a bid to help people with busy schedules, the UK's High Court will now livestream divorce proceedings. This means that instead of having to attend court in person, people can watch the proceedings on the internet.  All divorces in the United Kingdom will now be livestreamed, in order to make them more accessible and inclusive for all parties involved. The move comes as part of a larger effort to increase transparency in the court system, and to make it easier for both families and the public to follow the progress of divorces.  This new system will initially be implemented in the family division of court, and will be gradually rolled out to other courts as well. Divorces will now be live streamed on the UK Courts website, and will also be available on the UKBA YouTube channel.  The livestreaming of divorces is not new in the UK, of course. However, previous efforts have been limited to a select few courts and have not been available to the public at large. This change is likely to improve accessibility and transparency for both parties involved in a divorce, as well as making it easier for the public to follow the progress of the proceedings.']",
219,The coronavirus has officials running the world from home,"['There's no need for governments to be constantly in transit, as the coronavirus has proven able to run the world from home. By harnessing the internet and other modern communication tools, government officials can remain in contact with their constituents and carry out their duties in a timely and effective way. This ability to keep tabs on the goings-on in the world, as well as respond quickly to any potential emergencies, is a tremendous advantage for countries and organizations alike.  This is a false statement. The coronavirus has not officials running the world from home.  The coronavirus has officials running the world from home.  The coronavirus has officials running the world from home, according to a study published in the journal Science. In the study, researchers analyzed how well officials in different parts of the world responded to the crisis caused by the coronavirus. They found that while there were some regional differences, overall officials were not very effective in coordinating responses.  This is likely because the coronavirus is a global pandemic, meaning that it is affecting a large number of people around the world. This means that there are a lot of different priorities to deal with, and it is hard to prioritize what needs to be done. Additionally, officials are not always well-informed about the virus, which can make it difficult to make decisions.  Overall, the study suggests that officials need to be better prepared in order to respond to a global pandemic. They need to have a clear understanding of the virus and the implications it has, along with a plan for how to respond.

221,What does Britain know about coronavirus that the rest of Europe doesn't?,"['Britain is one of the countries that has been most heavily impacted by the coronavirus, with around a third of those infected living there. The country has been able to make rapid progress in its investigation and response, thanks to its experience of dealing with similar viruses such as SARS. This has given it a lead over other European countries in understanding the coronavirus and developingappropriate strategies for responding to it.  This is a difficult question to answer. It is possible that the UK knows more about coronavirus than the rest of Europe because it is a larger economy and has a larger scientific community. Additionally, the UK has been more proactive in responding to coronavirus concerns, possibly because the medical community is better prepared.  There is a lot of speculation about the coronavirus, as there is little known about it. What is known is that the virus is highly contagious and can cause severe respiratory illness in people of all ages. Symptoms of the virus include a high fever, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. The virus is most commonly spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as mucus or saliva, from an infected person. There is currently no cure or prevention for the virus, and it can be fatal in a large majority of cases.  Infection with coronavirus is not uncommon in the UK, where it is commonly referred to as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). However, the UK is not currently considered to be at risk of a coronavirus pandemic. This is in contrast to other European countries, which are considered to be at increased risk of a pandemic due to their proximity to regions where the virus is actively spreading.  The UK has been working closely with other European countries on the development of a coordinated response to the pandemic, and has been sharing its knowledge and expertise with other countries.

223,Our connected world made coronavirus spread. It may also be what saves us from it,"['.  Since 2006, coronavirus has been diagnosed in humans nearly every year, with a range of severity. The virus is highly contagious and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia.  Despite the annual outbreaks, coronavirus never mutated beyond a form that could be easily spread through coughing and sneezing. But in September, 2017, a new form of coronavirus emerged that could spread through close contact, such as touching hands or sharing cups or straws.  This new form of coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia, and quickly spread to other countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Sudden onset of severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia and even meningitis, has resulted in large numbers of deaths.  However, the new form of coronavirus has not yet spread beyond a handful of cases, and has not been found to cause any more fatalities than the older, more common form of the virus.  This may be because the new form of the virus is less contagious than the older form. For example, people who are infected with the new form of coronavirus are only two to eight times as likely to spread the virus to others as those who are infected with the older form of the virus.  The new form of coronavirus also seems to be less lethal than the older form, probably because it does not cause as much severe respiratory illness.  This is good news, because it may mean that the new form of coronavirus can be stopped from spreading more widely by simply preventing people from getting infected with it.  So far, the new form of coronavirus has not been found to cause any more fatalities than the older form. This is good news, because it may mean that the new form of coronavirus can be stopped from spreading more widely by simply preventing people from getting infected with it.  The interconnected world we live in has made it easier for the new form of coronavirus to spread.

The trilogy revolves around Cromwell's rise to power and his role in the dissolution of the monasteries and the English Reformation.  The trilogy has been met with widespread acclaim, with many reviewers calling it a masterpiece. Some of the main themes explored in the trilogy include power, religion, and the corruption of the aristocracy.  While the trilogy is undoubtedly an excellent work of historical fiction, it does not offer any new insights or revelations about the Tudor period. The story is based on historical events and characters, so it is not particularly surprising that it does not stray from the conventional wisdom about these events.   Consequently, for those who are interested in learning more about the Tudor period, 'Wolf Hall' trilogy may not be the most desirable option. However, for those who are simply looking for a good read, the trilogy is highly recommended.']",

The kit will allow health officials to more quickly and accurately identify any coronavirus cases.  The kit is expected to be available to the public in 2020.  A UK laboratory is partnering with Senegal to develop a hand-held coronavirus test kit. The aim is to speed up the process of detecting and diagnosing the virus, which can cause severe respiratory illness in humans.  The kit will include a handheld device to detect the virus and a laboratory test to confirm its presence. It is hoped that it will be available in the near future, facilitating faster diagnosis and response to outbreaks of coronavirus.  Coronavirus is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, in humans. It is closely related to the common cold and can be spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus. In recent years, coronavirus has been responsible for several large-scale outbreaks worldwide, including the 2014-16 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak and the 2016-17 linked Saudi Arabian virus (SARS) outbreak.  Given the seriousness of coronavirus outbreaks, it is important that authorities have quick access to accurate information about which patients are at risk and the best ways to treat them. The development of the hand-held coronavirus test kit is therefore a major step forward in speeding up the process of detection and diagnosis.  July 12, 2019 - Senegal partners with UK lab to develop a hand-held coronavirus test kit  A team of scientists from the United Kingdom and Senegal have teamed up to develop a hand-held coronavirus test kit. The project is funded by the Wellcome Trust and will investigate the feasibility of diagnosing virus infection using a handheld device.  There is currently no cure or prevention for coronavirus, which is a type of respiratory virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia. Early diagnosis is key to limiting the severity of the virus, and a diagnostic test kit that can be used by clinicians is urgently needed.  The kit will be developed in collaboration with the University of Dakar and the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Senegal. It will also be tested on human volunteers.  If the kit is successful, it may be used to screen patients for coronavirus infection in clinical settings. This would help to improve the early diagnosis of the virus and provide patients with the best possible chance of recovering.']",

229,Atletico Madrid stuns Liverpool at Anfield to dump holder out of the Champions League,"['Liverpool’s hopes of progressing to the Champions League knock-out stage were ended by a pulsating 3-2 victory against Atletico Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday night.  In a game that ebbed and flowed throughout, the visitors were deservedly two goals to the good at the break thanks to two stunning strikes from Koke, who collected a deft pass from Saul Niguez and drilled a sublime effort into the top corner from 25 yards.  Liverpool responded well and were level just after the hour mark when Philippe Coutinho picked up the ball in midfield and drove forward before driving a low shot past Thibaut Courtois.  But Atletico produced a stunning finish to seal their place in the last eight as Antoine Griezmann latched onto a sloppy pass from Alberto Moreno to fire home from just six yards out.  It was a harsh end for Liverpool, who remain in a strong position in Group B following consecutive victories over Maribor and Spartak Moscow.  Liverpool were looking to end their worst run in Europe since 1995 when they booked their place in the Last 16 of the Champions League with a 3-1 victory over Napoli on Wednesday night.

However, the odds of being able to do this are very low and it is not recommended.  The short answer is no – the travel ban, which restricts travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, includes a 90-day suspension of the US Refugee Admissions programme. This means that anyone travelling to the US from any of the seven countries listed in the ban – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – will not be able to enter the country as a refugee.  The UK Border Force has said that people who are travelling to the US on a passports that are valid for at least six months after the date of travel will be allowed to enter the US.  Currently, it is unclear if the US travel ban will be able to be circumvented by travelers through other countries.  It’s unclear at this point how the US travel ban will be implemented, but it seems unlikely that people travelling to the US will be able to enter via the UK. The US ban could result in a long border check and a possible delay in admission. It’s also possible that the ban will apply to UK nationals travelling to the US or US nationals travelling to the UK.  It is unclear how the new US travel ban will affect people traveling to the US from the UK. If you are traveling to the US on a valid passport and visa, it is likely that you will be able to enter the country. However, it is possible that you may be asked to show your passport and visa when entering the US, so it is best to be prepared for this scenario.']",

Roux was best known for his work at the London landmark Le Gavroche, where he was head chef from 1984 until his retirement in 2008.  In a statement to The Associated Press, the Roux family said that Michel ""passed away peacefully in his sleep"" on Tuesday evening.  ""He was a unique and extraordinary man whose legacy will live on through his many fans and respected colleagues around the world,"" the statement said.  Roux was born in Paris in 1938 and started out as a trainee at the famed Ritz restaurant.  In the 1970s he opened his own restaurant, L'Auberge du Pont de Breaueil, which was awarded a Michelin star in its first year.  Roux went on to open several other acclaimed restaurants, including Le Gavroche and l'Atelier, both of which retained their Michelin stars.  He was also a respected teacher, and gave lectures and cooking demonstrations around the world.  Roux is survived by his wife, two children and eight grandchildren.

In Senegal, a community of goat herders survives by raising their animals in a partially forested valley. In Peru, a group of Quechua farmers build their homes out of mud and straw, while managing a National Park that spans 11,000 hectares.  “Ecotopias are places where nature and people have come together in an equitable way,” Neville says. “They are a reminder that we can still find hope and solace in the world, if we look for it.”  Artist and artist-in-residence Neville Neville presents ""Ecotopias: A Forgotten Side of France,"" a semi-authentic series of portraits of people living exemplary lifestyles in ecotopias, or closed-off ecosystems that use minimal or restored resources.

The study, conducted by the University of California, San Diego, analyzed data from more than 1,600 cyclists who were injured in collisions with vehicles in Los Angeles between 2008 and 2016. The results showed that cyclists were more likely to be injured in collisions when travelling to work by bike than when travelling by any other means of transportation.  The study authors say that increased cycling safety requires increased attention from drivers and infrastructure designers. They recommend that drivers be more aware of cyclists, creating separate lanes or corridors for cyclists, and providing features such as bike racks and signalized intersections. In addition, they say, infrastructure designers should make sure streets are designed adequately to accommodate cyclists, including providing a safe and comfortable environment.  Biking to work appears more dangerous than other commuting options, a study has found.  The study, conducted by Cambridge University and the University of California, analysed data from reports from more than 5,000 cyclists who were involved in crashes between 2007 and 2011.  The research found that cyclists are more likely to be involved in a crash when travelling to work than when travelling to school, shopping or other destinations.  The study said that while cycling to work is a healthy option, it is more dangerous than other forms of commuting.

240,What the kimono's wide-reaching influence tells us about cultural appropriation,"['The kimono’s influence on Japanese fashion can be seen in both Japanese and Western clothing. In the West, kimonos are often seen as an elegant and classic piece of clothing, and are often worn at formal occasions. In Japan, kimonos are worn more commonly as a regular dress, and can be found in a variety of different styles and colours. The wide-reaching impact of the kimono tells us a lot about the way that culture can be appropriated and re-used, and how the use of a culture or symbol can be seen as a form of respect.  The kimono's wide-reaching influence tells us about cultural appropriation. First, the kimono is an important symbol of Japanese culture. Second, the kimono is frequently worn by people of all cultures and is often seen as an important part of a person's wardrobe. Third, the kimono has been worn by a variety of different cultures for centuries and has consequently been used to represent a variety of different cultures and traditions. Fourth, the kimono has often been worn as a symbol of femininity and wealth. Fifth, the kimono has been used as a medium for cultural exchange and has therefore been influential in the spread of different cultures throughout the world. All of these factors underscore the significance of cultural appropriation and illustrate the importance of taking into account the cultural context of items before wearing or using them.  When people wear a traditional Japanese garment such as a kimono, they are not only violating the cultural heritage of the Japanese people, they are also appropriating the aesthetic and cultural significance of the kimono. The wide-reaching influence of cultural appropriation shows us just how much damage it can do to a culture.']",

Catherine, what does fashion have to say about social and political issues?  I think that fashion can be a powerful tool for social change. When we think about the current political landscape, for example, it's so important that we're seeing more inclusive and diverse fashion choices. We need to be highlighting the individuality of all people, and celebrating the beauty of all identities.  What do you think is the key to creating inclusive fashion?  I think it's crucial that fashion designers and retailers incorporate social and political considerations into their designs from the very beginning. This way, they can create fashion that is truly reflective of the world we live in today.  What are your thoughts on the current state of beauty?  I think that beauty has to encompass more than just physical appeal. Today, we're seeing more and more brands and designers who are focusing on the holistic nature of beauty - which includes things like environmentalism and social justice.  I think that this type of holistic beauty is really powerful. It's encouraging people to think about what they're putting in their body and on their skin, and to consider the impact that these things have on the world around them.']",
243,The desexualization of the Asian American male,"['There has been a recent desexualization of the Asian American male in popular culture. This can be seen in the way that Asian American males are portrayed in movies, television shows, and music videos. For example, in the movie ""The Hangover"" Asian American males are portrayed as buff, muscular, and temporarily rich. In the television show ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" the Asian American male character, Josh, is a nerdy, overweight, and unappealing character. In the music video for the song ""Good Time"" by the rapper Fergie, the Asian American male character, Rafael, is depicted as a stripper.  There are several possible reasons for this desexualization of the Asian American male. One possibility is that the Asian American male is often seen as asexual or nerdy in the American culture. Another possibility is that the Asian American male is often portrayed in a negative light in popular culture. Finally, it is possible that the Asian American male is no longer seen as an attractive or desirable figure in popular culture.  The desexualization of the Asian American male can be seen in how society perceives them. In Western society, Asia is commonly seen as a nation of submissive, docile, and passive women, who are unable to fend for themselves. Asian men are often portrayed as being effeminate, weak, and nerdy. This stereotype has a serious impact on the way Asians are treated in the United States, and in many other parts of the world.   Jianghan Zhang and Min Zhou write, ""The image of the submissive and docile Asian woman has been so thoroughly ingrained in Western society that it is now difficult to identify instances in which Asian women are portrayed in a gender-sensitive way. In general, the depiction of Asian women in the media is generally one-dimensional and condescending."" This stereotype has a serious impact on the way Asians are treated in the United States, and in many other parts of the world.  Asian American men are often the targets of sexual harassment and assault. A study by the Asian American Federation found that, between 2004 and 2006, reports of sexual assault against Asian Americans increased by 137 percent. This is despite the fact that, according to the FBI, Asians are less likely to be the victims of crime than any other race.  This desexualization of the Asian American male has a broader impact on the way Asians are treated in society. It contributes to the stereotype that Asians are incompetent and unable to handle their own affairs. It also makes it more difficult for Asian Americans to achieve success in the United States, and in many other parts of the world.']",

246,Photographer Kyle Weeks uses his medium to show that manhood in Africa is not a singular image,"['. He challenges the standard image of a muscular and robust black man as the symbol of masculinity, instead portraying a more varied and nuanced collection of individuals.  He does this by photographing everyday men, both young and old, in their natural environments. Some are working in the fields, others are playing games in the village square, but all are displaying the unique character traits that make up the true essence of masculinity in African culture.  Weeks’s project illustrates that there is no one definitive image of manhood in Africa, and that the true definition of masculinity is much more complex and diverse than what we typically see portrayed in the media.. He often photographs groups of men playing games, working in the fields, or simply hanging out together.  He says that ""the purpose of my work is to show the diversity and richness of manhood in Africa."" He observes that when people see his images they often ""learn more about the individuals in the photos and the cultures that they represent.""  Weeks has exhibited his work around the world, and his book ""Uncommon Heroes: Men of Africa"" was published in 2017.. He often photographs subjects who defy expectations of what it means to be a man in Africa.  Weeks has been photographing men in Africa for over a decade and his images challenge the traditional representations of how manhood is perceived in the continent. The idea that there is only one form of manhood, or that manhood is solely defined by toughness and physical prowess, is deeply entrenched in many African cultures.  In his series ""Masculinity on Trial,"" Weeks photographs men who are challenging traditional notions of masculinity in their communities. These men are exploring new ways of being masculine, and pushing boundaries as they challenge traditional expectations.  Weeks says that he aims to challenge people's perceptions of what it means to be a masculine man in Africa. By showing that there is more than one form of masculinity, he is helping to create a more inclusive society where all men can feel comfortable being themselves.']",

The curious market for Old Masters replicas,"['A replica of the Mona Lisa that's been authenticated by an expert and sells for $60,000 is on display at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.  When Mona Lisa was first painted in the 1500s, it may have cost as much as 60,000 gold florins to purchase her. Today, a high-quality replica of the painting may only cost around $60,000.  Mona Lisa for $60K? The curious market for Old Masters replicas  When it comes to the world’s most famous painting, nothing is more valuable than the original. But what about a replica?  Forget the standard copy. There’s a curious market for Old Masters replicas that is growing rapidly, with prices reaching as high as $60,000.  Experts say part of the appeal is that these paintings are timeless and can be displayed in any home.  “There is a huge interest in these paintings and the prices are going up exponentially because of it,” says Darren Burch, an art consultant in London.  “People want to own a piece of history that is not going to change over time.”  The origins of the replica market for Old Masters paintings are still a mystery, but experts say it is likely fueled by the increasing rarity of the originals.  “There is a growing sense of obsession with these paintings and the demand is driving up the prices,” Burch says.  “The market is still in its infancy and we may not know what the future holds for these paintings, but for now, they are sure to continue to be popular.”']",
264,"Under Xi's rule, what is China's image of the 'ideal' man?","['There is no single 'ideal' man in China, as the country has a vast range of cultural values and norms. However, under Xi's rule, the dominant image of the 'ideal' man in China is typically seen as strong, respectful of tradition andFamily, and possessing intelligent and decisive qualities.  Xi Jinping has promoted an image of the ""ideal"" man which is focused on hard work, loyalty to the Party and the collective, and reliance on self-reliance. This represents a departure from the previous focus on Confucian values such as filial piety and respect for elders.  Xi Jinping has championed a highly centralized idea of the perfect man, one who is devoted to the Communist Party, fearless and resolute, with absolute authority.  China's image of the 'ideal' man has changed over the years. During the Mao era, the ideal man was patriotic and was willing to do whatever it took to build the country. After the death of Mao, the ideal man became someone who was strong and able to take care of himself. Today, the ideal man is someone who is responsible and able to provide for himself and his family.    Xi Jinping has promoted an image of the ""ideal man"" in which he is a strong, decisive leader who is able to see things clearly and make snap decisions. The government has also erected a number of propaganda structures aimed at promoting this image, including a new museum devoted to Xi's life and work.  The 'ideal' man under Xi Jinping is someone who is disciplined, obedient, and willing to work hard. He is also supposed to be ambitious and have high standards for himself.']",

266,Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes,"['In Korea, drag queens and transgender performers are often ostracized by society. This is especially true in Seoul, which is known for its conservative attitude.  Despite this, the drag scene in Seoul is growing rapidly. There are now several drag clubs and performance venues throughout the city, and drag queens are becoming increasingly visible.  This is partly due to the increasing acceptance of LGBT rights in South Korea. In 2017, the country passed a law allowing same-sex marriage and gender reassignment surgery, which has helped to broadened the public's understanding of drag performers.  However, drag performers still face a lot of discrimination. They are often teased and excluded from social events, and they often have to work to maintain a low profile.  Nonetheless, the drag scene in Seoul is thriving and is likely to continue growing fast. It is an important reminder that even in a conservative society, there is room for creative expression.  South Korea's burgeoning drag scene is confronting conservative attitudes, with many performers facing backlash from conservatives who see their performances as an affront to traditional values.  South Korea is a country with a long and largely conservative history, and drag performances have traditionally been seen as a subversive act. But with South Korea's growing drag culture, performers are increasingly finding themselves at odds with conservative attitudes.  Shin Dong-kyun, a drag performer who goes by the stage name Lady Bunny, said that despite the challenges, she is still determined to perform. ""Drag is about pushing boundaries, and I want to continue doing that,"" she says.  Many of Lady Bunny's detractors see her performance as an intentional challenge to South Korea's traditional values. In one widely shared video, a conservative commentator argues that drag performers are promoting an ""underclass lifestyle"" that is harmful to society.  Lady Bunny says that she has faced discrimination and hostility from many people in South Korea, but that she is still determined to continue performing. ""I know that I have a lot of fans who support me, even though they might not always agree with my methods,"" she says. ""I'm grateful for their support.""']",
267,Menswear has never been so casual. So why is the image of a man in uniform still so alluring?,"['For some, the allure of a man in uniform is unmistakable. It may be the sense of adventure that comes with being a soldier or the sense of power and authority that comes with being a police officer. For others, the allure may simply be the masculinity of a man in uniform. Whether it is a military uniform or a police uniform, a man in uniform always exudes a sense of strength and power.  There are a few reasons why the image of a man in uniform still remains alluring. First, uniforms are a form of rebellion. They are a statement that the wearer doesn't care about what society expects of them, and they are willing to stand up for what they believe in. This rebellious attitude is attractive to some people, who find that it symbolizes freedom. Second, uniforms are often fitted and stylish, which makes them look muscular and attractive. Finally, uniforms can make a man look powerful and in control, which is another attractive trait.  When you think of a military man, you probably think of someone in uniform. But that's not always the case. Men in uniforms can look very casual and comfortable. It's a look that can be pulled off with different styles and settings. Plus, it can be a very masculine look that can set you apart from the rest.  There’s no one answer to this question, as people are attracted to different aspects of uniforms depending on their own personal preferences. However, some experts believe that the allure of uniforms may simply be due to the fact that they represent status and power. Additionally, uniforms can often be more comfortable and practical than traditional clothing, which can make them more appealing to people who are looking for more versatile fashion options.']",
268,Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem,"['Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem. Brazilian designers and marketers have consistently been behind the curve when it comes to including a diverse range of models in their campaigns and runway shows, which often feature predominantly white models. This lack of diversity has also extended to Brazil's high fashion industry, where only 2% of senior fashion professionals are from a racial and ethnic minority. Consequently, Brazil's fashion industry is not only failing to reflect the country's population, but also its youth. In a study conducted by the National Council of Ethnic Minorities, 36% of Brazilian adolescents reported feeling discriminated against in the fashion industry.  Since the 1990s, the Brazilian fashion industry has consistently been ranked as one of the most unequal in the world. While Brazil has made strides in recent years in terms of economic and social mobility, its fashion industry continues to be dominated by a small number of large, international companies. This has created a climate of exclusion and discrimination for Brazilian fashion designers, who face stiff competition from overseas counterparts. There is also a lack of diversity in the Brazilian fashion industry, which has led to a lack of representation of marginalized communities, such as Afro-Brazilians, indigenous people, and people with disabilities. As a result, Brazilian fashion designers are largely apolitical and lack the necessary representation to advocate for sustainable change in the industry.  Brazil's fashion industry has a diversity problem.  There are very few designers and models of color in Brazil's fashion industry, which is likely due to the country's history of racism and discrimination. This lack of diversity has a negative impact on the industry as a whole, as it limits the number of creative voices and representations available to consumers. It also limits the opportunities for talented people of color to break into the industry and find work that reflects their personal and professional values.  There are a few initiatives underway to address this problem. One is the launch of the BFA fashion program at the University of São Paulo, which is specifically designed to promote diversity in the fashion industry. Another is the cosmetics company Colors Unlimited's commitment to hiring a diverse range of models and spokespeople.  While progress has been made, more needs to be done to create a more inclusive fashion industry in Brazil. Racism and discrimination must be addressed head-on, and designers and consumers of color must be given equal opportunity to participate in the industry.']",

The shirt, which is now being sold out, sparked outrage from those who feel that it reinforces negative stereotypes about people of color and the justice system.

The archive, now housed at the Dakar Museum of Fine Arts, contains more than 3,000 photographs documenting the city’s transformation from a dusty, impoverished outpost into a thriving metropolitan center in the 1950s and ’60s.  “I was fascinated by the glamour and the fashion of that era,” Guèye, now 43, told AFP. “I wanted to document Dakar’s progress and show it to the younger generation.”  Dakar’s transformation from a dusty outpost into a thriving metropolitan center in the 1950s and ’60s was documented by high school student Souleymane Guèye in his photo archive.  The archive was created in the 1990s when Guèye and his classmates at the Lycée Français d’Afrique noire in Dakar were preparing for their baccalaureate exams. “Since there was no digital photography at the time, we had to use film and develop our own negatives,” he recalled.  With the help of local photo editors and collectors, Guèye has scoured antique stores and flea markets to source rare vintage photographs of Dakar.  “The 1950s were a time of great change in Senegal,” said Guèye. “So many things changed, from the way people dressed to the way they lived.”  The glamour of the era is captured in Guèye’s archive, which has been exhibited at museums in France and Senegal. One of the most recent exhibitions was at the Dakar Museum of Fine Arts in 2018.']",

286,Vintage photos show the unsung heroes of the US suffrage movement,"['Vintage photos show the unsung heroes of the US suffrage movement. In the early 20th century, women all over the United States were working towards gaining the right to vote. Some of the most influential suffragists were the women in these photos, who tirelessly campaigned for equal rights for women.  In November 1867, a group of women gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, to discuss women's right to vote. The women in attendance – including Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Matilda Joslyn Gage – knew that they had to act quickly if they wanted to win the right to vote.  Fortunately for the women, they had the support of men like Henry Thoreau, who wrote an editorial in the Times asking readers to support the cause of voting rights for women. The support of men was crucial because, up to that point, women had been denied the right to vote by both the federal and state governments.  Despite the support of men and the quick work of the suffrage movement, it would take until 1920 for women to gain the right to vote nationwide. Though the battle was not an easy one, these vintage photos from the early days of the suffrage movement show just how committed the women in attendance were to achieving their goal.  In the early days of the women's suffrage movement, most of the attention was drawn to the likes of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul and Susan B. Anthony.

288,Savers are getting destroyed by super low interest rates,"['There are numerous myths about interest rates and savings. Here are five of the most common myths about interest rates and savings.  1. Low interest rates will automatically save money.  This is not always the case. For example, if you have a high-interest rate debt, a low interest rate may not save any money. In fact, if your interest rate is below the applicable market rate, you may be losing money.  2. You can only save by taking money out of your account every month.  This is not always the case. In fact, you can reinvest your money(s) back into your account at the prevailing interest rate, which could increase your savings over time.  3. You need to have a high savings rate to qualify for a high interest rate savings account.  This is not always the case. In fact, many high-interest rate savings accounts have lower eligibility requirements than traditional savings accounts.  4. You have to have a high balance in your account to earn interest.  This is not always the case. In fact, you can earn interest on both your principal and your interest balance.  5. You can't use your savings to invest in the stock market.  This is not always the case. In fact, you can use your savings to invest in the stock market, as well as other types of investments, such as real estate and hedge funds.  Savers are getting destroyed by low interest rates because they're locked into high-interest debt. They're also getting destroyed by fees and other costs associated with saving and investing.

290,The great shutdown of 2020: How newsrooms and media companies are adapting,"['The shutdown of the U.S. government on Tuesday has created a unique media opportunity.  The looming shutdown of the federal government just over one month from now is likely to have a significant impact on the newsrooms and media companies of the United States.  The breakdown of the federal government will have a major impact on the media industry in 2020.  As lawmakers continue to squabble over how to fund the government, some small businesses and individuals are feeling the brunt of the shutdown. NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik, has the latest on how newsrooms and media companies are adapting.  The shutdown of federal government in the United States of America has caused a lot of disruption for newsrooms and media companies, but they are all finding ways to adapt.  The shutdown of federal agencies on Oct. 15, 2018, created a ripple effect in the United States media ecosystem. This wide-reaching shutdown impacted the newsrooms of major media companies, as well as smaller media operations.  Overall, the shutdown had a negative impact on the media landscape. Fewer federal employees meant that newsrooms had to cut back on coverage of national and international stories. Some media companies also had to lay off staff.  Overall, though, many media companies adapted to the shutdown by shifting their focus to local stories. Some companies also increased their use of digital platforms, such as social media, to disseminate their news.  The Federal government shutdown of 2019-2020 largely led by the standoff over funding for the southern border led to widespread reports about the shutdown. Some outlets resorted to satire, including The Onion’s fictional article “The Great Shutdown of 2020.” In the article, various news organizations and media companies are forced to close their doors due to a lack of funding and a shortage of reporters. Some, such as CNN, TNT, and The New York Times, are forced to merge with other media companies. Others, such as The Washington Post, end up being bought by Amazon.com. Overall, though, the shutdown had a significant impact on newsrooms and media companies across the United States.  In the aftermath of the shutdown, many newsrooms and media companies took a step back and reassessed their strategies. Some, such as The New York Times, eliminated some of their less profitable divisions in order to focus on their core operations. Other newsrooms, such as MSNBC and The Washington Post, invested in new technology, such as AI, in order to better compete with digital media platforms. Overall, though, the shutdown had a significant impact on the media industry in the United States, and newsrooms and media companies are still adapting to its aftermath.']",

309,How facial recognition went from bad TV to Big Brother,"['From the early days of television, facial recognition technology was used as a plot point in many TV shows and movies. For example, on ""The X-Files,"" FBI agent Fox Mulder was obsessed with tracking down a suspect using facial recognition technology.  However, facial recognition technology has come a long way since then. Today, facial recognition technology is widely used in a variety of applications, including security monitoring and marketing.  One of the key factors responsible for the widespread use of facial recognition technology is the advancement of computer technology. Today, computer algorithms are much better at recognizing facial features than they were 10 years ago.  This has led to facial recognition technology being adopted more and more by businesses and government agencies. facial recognition technology is now considered a key part of many security monitoring systems, and it is often used to identify individuals in photos or videos.  Facial recognition technology is also being used to identify people in marketing campaigns. For example, Facebook uses facial recognition technology to identify people in photos and videos that are posted on the social media website.  As facial recognition technology becomes more widespread and accurate, it is likely that we will see more examples of it being used in our everyday lives.  Back in the 1950s, a TV show called I Spy asked viewers to identify a person's face from a lineup. The show then used that information to help solve crimes.  But the technology behind facial recognition wasn't very good back then. So the show's producers used a process called ""age-progression"" to make the faces look older or younger.  Today, facial recognition technology is much more accurate. That's why some governments are using it to track people's movements and activities.  Some people are worried that facial recognition technology will become a way for the government to track all of us. So they're working on ways to prevent it from happening.']",
310,How a coronavirus 'infodemic' is infecting the internet,"['A coronavirus ""infodemic"" is causing people to share information about the virus online, potentially leading to its further spread.  One way a coronavirus “infodemic” is infecting the internet is by way of social media. Viruses are able to replicate more easily when they are inside of cells that are actively dividing (such as those in the intestinal tract), so researchers believe that people may be more susceptible to coronavirus infections when they are online, because they are more likely to share information and engage in social networking activities.  A coronavirus ""infodemic"" is infecting the internet, according to a new report from cybersecurity firm Proofpoint. The report says that a significant number of online discussions are dominated by information about coronaviruses and ways to protect oneself from infection.  Proofpoint's research found that the most active topics on social media and online forums focused on coronavirus prevention and information sharing. The company also found that discussions about coronaviruses are being driven by a ""groundswell of online concern"" from the public.  While coronavirus outbreaks have historically been limited to developing countries, the recent spread of the virus online has raised concerns about its potential impact on global health. The report's authors say that the internet provides a "" Werner Herzog-like platform for advancing fear and misinformation"" about coronaviruses.  Proofpoint's report provides a snapshot of the online conversation about coronaviruses, and it's possible that the data presented may not be representative of the entire population. However, the report's findings underscore the importance of understanding the consequences of outbreaks of coronavirus and the need to engage the public in efforts to prevent their spread.']",

319,Pentagon 'wishes to reconsider' $10 billion contract given to Microsoft over Amazon,"['The Pentagon ""wishes to reconsider"" a $10 billion contract given to Microsoft over Amazon, the Department of Defense's top acquisition official said Friday. The decision to reconsider was made in the wake of a report by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday that found the Defense Department's decision to go with Microsoft was not well-planned. ""In recognition of GAO's findings and current portfolio management challenges, the Defense Department wishes to reconsider its decision to award the Microsoft contract,"" Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics David Goldfein said in a statement. ""We are taking steps to ensure the decision was based on the best information available at the time.""  The Pentagon is looking to reconsider a $10 billion contract given to Microsoft over Amazon, Bloomberg reports. The assessment comes as the Defense Department faces increasing scrutiny of how taxpayer dollars are being spent.  The Department of Defense announced in 2016 that it would spend almost $10 billion over 10 years on software contracts, with Microsoft slated to receive the largest share. But the company's contract has come under fire in recent months, as Amazon's cloud computing platform has become increasingly popular in the Defense Department.  In a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from Texas, wrote that she was “alarmed” by the contracting process, which she said “does not appear to have taken into account the true capabilities of the two leading cloud computing providers.”  The investigation into Microsoft's contract is still in its early stages, Pentagon spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis said.']",

322,NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners,"['The NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners.  TV networks that broadcast NBA games must scramble to come up with new programming to fill the vacuum.  The NBA is the most popular professional basketball league in the world, and a prolonged suspension would have a big impact on ticket sales, merchandise sales, and TV ratings.  The suspension could also cost the league a lot of money in lost revenue.  NBA suspending its season is a serious blow to its TV partners  The NBA is suspending its season, costing its TV partners millions in advertising revenue.  TV networks pay the NBA a large sum of money every year in order to broadcast games. Without the NBA, these networks would lose that revenue.  The NBA has been struggling financially for some time now, and this decision only compounds that problem. The league has been trying to negotiate new TV deals, but those negotiations have been difficult.  If the NBA can't secure new deals, then it may be forced to suspend its season. This would be a huge blow to the league, as it would lose a lot of fans.  When NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that the 2017-18 season would be the league's final year, many pundits, fans, and insiders speculated that this would have a negative impact on television ratings.  According to Silver, the decision to end the season was made in order to focus on the sport's ""mission and vision."" But, as the commissioner acknowledged, the decision has a significant impact on TV partners.  ""While we understand the disappointment and disappointment among our fans, the decision to suspend the 2017-18 season was not made lightly,"" Silver said. ""Our primary focus and mission remains to put on the best possible NBA product on the court and to grow the game of basketball globally.""  Some of the NBA's television partners reacted to the news by expressing their disappointment, including ESPN, TNT, and ABC.  However, many others, like Turner Broadcasting's TNT, were more mindful of the league's mission and vision and applauded the decision.  ""Turner Broadcasting is proud of our longstanding association with the NBA and will continue to be a major league partner,"" the company said in a statement.  The NBA's decision to suspend the season is a stark contrast to the NFL, which is facing a growing backlash over its handling of the National Anthem protests. The NFL's television ratings have suffered in recent years, and many experts believe that the league's decision to keep its season going has played a part in that.

323,How NASA's Apollo program kicked off Silicon Valley's tech revolution,"['The moon was humanity's first step off of Earth. The Apollo program, which ran from 1961 to 1972, was an unprecedented engineering achievement that put man on the moon.  One of the key technologies that made Apollo possible was Silicon Valley's early development of transistor technology. The transistors were tiny electronic components that allowed engineers to build complex circuits, something that was unthinkable just a few years earlier.   Silicon Valley's tech industry largely sprang from the invention of the transistor, a technology that was developed by Intel, Motorola, and other firms. The Apollo program kick-started Silicon Valley's tech revolution, paving the way for companies such as Apple and Google.  In the early days of the Apollo program, NASA turned to private industry to help them achieve their goals. One of the most important initiatives was the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer, or AGC.  The AGC was a powerful computer that was used to help astronauts navigate their way around the moon and back to Earth. Because of its importance, the AGC was developed by numerous different companies, including General Telephone and Electronics (GTE), Intel, and Hewlett-Packard.  These companies were largely responsible for kickstarting Silicon Valley's tech revolution. Thanks to the AGC, technology became more widespread and accessible, which allowed for the development of new and innovative products. In fact, many of the technologies that are commonly used today, like digital computers and telecommunications, were born out of the Apollo program.  The Apollo program, which was initiated by the United States in the late 1960s, kick-started Silicon Valley's tech revolution by getting humans off of the ground and into space. By doing this, NASA opened up a world of new opportunities for technology development and innovation, which in turn led to the creation of many of Silicon Valley's most well-known companies.']",
324,Jeff Bezos just sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock. Here's why,"['On Friday, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sold approximately $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock, according to Bloomberg. This comes shortly after the news that Amazon is planning to increase its workforce by 25,000 in the next year.  The reason for the sale is unknown, but it could be part of Bezos' plan to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. This comes after reports surfaced in March that the majority owner of The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, was looking to buy the newspaper. Bezos has since denied these reports.  Amazon is one of the most valuable companies in the world and its stock has been on a tear in the past few years. In October, Bezos' net worth was estimated to be $137.7 billion.  As of 10:00 a.m. EST, Jeff Bezos' net worth is $157.1 billion, according to Forbes.  So today, Bezos sold $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock.  Here's why:  On Wednesday, Amazon released its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report. The company reported revenue of $74.1 billion and income of $5.01 billion, both records. However, one of the most important pieces of information in Amazon's earnings report was the number of Amazon Prime memberships, which increased by 50 million to over 100 million.  This increase in membership means that more people are using Amazon's ""free two-day shipping"" and "" Kindle Unlimited"" services. This is good news for Amazon, as it means that more people are buying goods from the company and spending more money.  So why did Bezos sell $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock today?  According to CNBC, ""The Amazon founder and CEO continues to pump cash into Amazon, buying an additional $8.2 billion worth of the e-commerce giant's stock since Tuesday's close.""  This means that Bezos is confident in the future of Amazon and its products. He knows that the company's growth will continue and that its stock price will continue to rise.']",

329,A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,"['McDonald's is dipping its toes into the world of 3D printing. The fast food chain announced this week that it's teamed up with the ATHENA Project, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing 3D printing technology, in order to help restaurants create custom orders using its cooking oil.  The project is slated to begin in the next few months with a test run at a McDonald's in Finland. The goal is to eventually let customers order their food via smartphone app and have it delivered to their table in a 3D-printed container.  The move is likely in response to the growing popularity of food delivery services like UberEats and Seamless. By 2020, food delivery is expected to generate $24 billion in revenues, according to Grand View Research.  McDonald's says the 3D printing process is safe and the oil doesn't pose a health risk. The chain says it will collect data on how customers respond to the service in order to fine-tune the design.  Thanks to the oil's properties, it can be used to create semi-solid objects using a 3D printer. Because of the oil's viscosity, it can be used to create things like molds, prosthetic limbs, and other medical devices.  McDonald's has announced a new way to use its cooking oil: by printing it out using 3D printers. The hope is that this will help reduce the amount of oil that is used, and help to cut down on the costs associated with it.  McDonald's used cooking oil can now be used to create 3D objects, as demonstrated by researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM).  The researchers used a food-grade cooking oil to create three-dimensional objects using a 3D printer.

Most economists tend to focus on the technological advances that have driven down the cost of goods and services. But artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to be just as important in reshaping the economy.  The reason is that AI is making it possible to automate tasks that used to be done by human workers. And as those tasks become automated, the cost of those goods and services goes down.  This is already happening with respect to labor. In recent years, the cost of factory labor has fallen as robots have taken over many of the tasks that used to be done by human beings.  AI is also reshaping the cost of capital. In the past, a company needed people to invest in it in order to expand. But now, a company can get the same amount of capital by getting loans from a bank.  The result is that the cost of capital is going down, which is good for businesses. The downside is that this is pushing up the cost of goods and services.  That’s why AI is likely to have a big impact on the economy in the years ahead.']",

The service offers delivery from a variety of restaurants, including well-known chains like Chipotle and Five Guys.  Eats is Uber’s latest attempt to dethrone Amazon as the dominant player in online retail. ButEats faces a number of daunting obstacles.  First, the service is not available in every city. And even where it is, Uber’s delivery service is often significantly less expensive than Amazon’s.  Second, the food businesses that are Uber Eats’s main partners are not the biggest players in their respective industries. That means they’re not likely to generate the kinds of profits that Amazon can.  Third, Uber is struggling to build a loyal customer base for its delivery service. So far, only 1 percent of Eats orders have been completed using the Uber app. That compares with Amazon’s 95 percent.  Fourth, Uber is not the only company trying to compete with Amazon in the food delivery market. In 2017, food delivery company DoorDash acquired Uber’s food delivery business in Seattle.

But the government is facing strong public opposition to the decision to kill off the trains. BBC News's Tom Hall reports.  The sun beats down mercilessly on the dusty track as a train crosses it, kicking up a cloud of red dust.  The Pacer is one of Britain's most despised trains. The 60-year-old rolling stock is so slow and unreliable that it is often ridiculed and has been the subject of heavy lobbying from the transport unions.  But the government has decided to scrap the trains, after 30 years of service.  The announcement has provoked strong public opposition, with many people accusing the government of being too quick to kill off the trains.  The Pacer is seen as a symbol of Britain's economic decline, and its demise has been widely celebrated on social networking websites.  The trains first rolled off the production line in 1958 and are now being phased out in order to make way for new trains that are faster, more reliable and more energy-efficient.  But with the government facing strong public opposition, the decision to scrap the Pacer may not be final.  Britain's hated Pacer trains just won't go away.  The trains, which first arrived in the 1980s, are often described as noisy, dirty and inconvenient.

There have been calls for the trains to be scrapped, but so far the Government has failed to come up with a viable replacement.  Some say that the Pacer trains are a symbol of Britain's Labour government's failure to modernise the country's railways.']",

The influx has led to protests, violence, and the formation of vigilante groups that harass newcomers.  Now, many of the European Union’s new arrivals areafraid to come to the bloc’s borders, fearing that they will be harassed or even attacked by vigilantes.  “What we are seeing now is a very different reaction from Southern and Eastern Europe,” said Christos Stylianides, the European commissioner for human rights. “After months of welcoming refugees, people in those parts of the union are now saying we can’t handle this influx anymore.”  The fear of vigilantes has led to a drop in the number of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to enter Europe, according to reports.  “People are not risking their lives to come to Europe, because they are afraid they will be attacked,” Stylianides said. “This is a worrying trend.”  Some of the vigilante groups that have formed in Europe are made up of ordinary citizens who are angry about the influx of refugees. Others are made up of people who have extremist views and are looking for a reason to lash out.  Some of the vigilante groups have been spotted intimidating, harassing, and even attacking refugees.  In Germany, for example, groups of far-right protesters have been targeting refugees and destroying their property. In Italy, groups of neo-fascist terrorists have been targeting immigrants and attacking refugee centers.  “The problem is not just the vigilante groups,” Stylianides said. “These groups exist because there is a problem with the law and with the way the system is working.”  The EU is now considering ways to beef up its security forces and to create new laws to prevent the formation of vigilante groups.  “We need to find a way to engage these people, to have a dialogue with them and to show them that what they are doing is not right,” Stylianides said.']",

As the world braces for a potential pandemic, many workers are asking themselves if they should self-isolate or if they should get paid.  Some people believe that self-isolation is the best option because it's the most precautionary. Self-isolating means not interacting with other people, which can help prevent the spread of the virus.  Others feel that it's important to get paid during a pandemic, in case the work stoppage causes a hardship for them or their family.

""People who have stockpiled food, water and medical supplies may have been able to get those to people who were cut off from the outside world.""  If the pandemic ends quickly, Dickinson says, many people who are prepping may have ended up benefitting from the situation.  Last year, a study by the British social media monitoring firm, Convolve, found that one in three UK adults have been directly engaged with prepping content, either through discussion or through buying or sharing products.  “Preppers are not just a niche group, they are the norm,” the study’s co-author, Robert Sumner, told the Daily Mail.  And while most people who engage with prepping content are not actually preparing for a global pandemic, or any unforeseen event, they have nevertheless become the butt of jokes and ridicule.  “Preppers are always being mocked and ridiculed, in particular during times of pandemics and other health scares,” said Sumner. “This is likely because people see them as being paranoid and irrational, and don’t take them seriously.”  But Sumner believes that the popularity of prepping can be traced back to the 2012 pandemic of coronavirus, which caused widespread panic and caused many people to re-evaluate their lifestyles, including preppers.  “Preppers are not just a niche group, they are the norm”  “With pandemics, people are often seeking information and reassurance,” he said. “Preppers offer an established community of like-minded individuals, who can offer support and information during a time of crisis.”  Indeed, the prepping community has proved to be a powerful force when it comes to rallying people around common causes.  “Preppers are a potentially powerful group,” said Sumner. “They are often well-educated, with a lot of financial resources, and they are ready to take action when disaster strikes.”  This grassroots activism is evident in the response to recent outbreaks of disease, such as the SARS pandemic of 2003, the Ebola crisis of 2014, and the current pandemic of coronavirus.  “Preppers are often well-educated and have a lot of financial resources”  “Preppers have responded head on to both the SARS pandemic and Ebola, by donating money and goods,” said Sumner. “This shows that they are willing to take action, and are not just']",

You will need to check with your carrier to find out the specifics of their policy on cell phone calls during flight.

That's because airlines are increasingly offering high-quality voice services that are compatible with cell phones, and passengers seem to be happy with the service.

This led to the creation of some of Hungary's most popular restaurants, such as Gerbeaud and Gerber. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, Budapest's culinary scene really began to explode.

Heather Swift said that she supports the policy because it results in “better” outcomes for children.  “I think that the separation of children at the border, as a result of the zero-tolerance policy, is something that is actually, I think, good for the children,” Swift told CNN.  “I would say that the vast majority of the time when parents are taken into custody, they are eventually released and the child is returned to the care of the parent or guardian. I think that the child experiences better outcomes when the parent is actually with the child,” she added.  Swift’s statement is especially notable because it represents a dramatic break from the Trump administration’s official stance. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has long insisted that the policy is necessary to prevent families from crossing the border illegally and “illegally gaining advantage over U.S. law-abiding citizens by entering the country illegally with their children.”  The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism over its practice of separating migrant families.

407,WHO declares novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic,"['On Wednesday, August 2, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. WHO has defined a pandemic as a widespread, serious, and often deadly disease outbreak.  The novel coronavirus is a type of respiratory illness that is highly contagious. It can cause severe respiratory illness in individuals who are infected. The virus is also deadly in some cases.  As of August 2, 2019, there have been 74 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in 20 countries. The vast majority of cases (59%) has been found in Saudi Arabia. The other countries where cases have been reported are Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Spain.  So far, the novel coronavirus has resulted in 24 deaths.  The World Health Organization declared a novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on 1 July 2019. This follows the identification of a new coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-19, and the designation of a healthcare-associated coronavirus (HCACV) as a global health emergency on 24 June 2019.  As of 1 July 2019, WHO has identified a total of 101 cases of SARS-CoV-19 worldwide, including 49 cases in 2019. Of the 49 cases in 2019, 27 have been reported from Saudi Arabia, six from Qatar, four from the United Arab Emirates, three from Oman, two from Jordan, and one from Britain.  WHO’s Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said:  “The risk of a global outbreak is high and this new coronavirus must be closely monitored. WHO urges all countries to take steps to prevent the virus from spreading, such as requiring close contact precautions for patients and staff, and working with their partners to rapidly identify and track cases.”  Why is WHO declaring a new coronavirus outbreak a pandemic?  WHO has designated a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-19, as a global health emergency. As of 1 July 2019, WHO has identified a total of 101 cases of SARS-CoV-19 worldwide, including 49 cases in 2019. Of the 49 cases in 2019, 27 have been reported from Saudi Arabia, six from Qatar, four from the United Arab Emirates, three from Oman, two from Jordan, and one from Britain.  A pandemic is a significant global health event with widespread effects. It is formally declared when there are at least 1,000 confirmed or probable cases in a given country, territory, or region. A pandemic can also be declared if there is an outbreak that is continuing and has a significant impact on public health.  What are the risks of a global outbreak of SARS-CoV-19?

408,Contact tracing is key to America's coronavirus strategy. What happens if it stops working well?,"['If the virus tracking system stops working well, coronavirus experts will need to use other methods to identify people with the virus, such as contacting hospitals or clinics where people may have been in close contact with people with the virus.  If it stops working well, the government will need to find a new way to trace people who have contracted the virus.  Health officials are currently conducting a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether a vaccine against the coronavirus will be effective. If the vaccine proves to be ineffective, the strategy will likely shift to a more aggressive approach, such as using antiviral drugs to treat people who are infected.  The best-case scenario is that the virus stops spreading, and no one gets sick. Other possibilities include that a vaccine or treatment is developed, that people find ways to avoid getting sick, or that the virus mutates so that people become more vulnerable to it.  Tracing is key to America's coronavirus strategy. If it stops working well, then investigators would look for other clues to figure out where the virus is spreading.  If the nation's coronavirus strategy stops working well, then it would be important for public health officials to take steps to improve communication with affected communities and to increase awareness of the virus. In the event that the strategy fails, public health officials may also need to consider other strategies, such as increasing the availability of treatments and antiviral drugs.']",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidance on Thursday cautioning older adults to “stay at home as much as possible” due to the coronavirus.  The new guidance advises people ages 65 and older to avoid contact with people who are sick, especially if those people are unable to take precautions to prevent transmission, and recommends that everyone else follow similar precautions, including washing their hands often and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.  The guidance was released as the coronavirus continues to cause large numbers of reported infections in the United States and elsewhere. As of May 31, 2018, there have been 25 confirmed cases of the virus in the United States, including two deaths.  The CDC notes that the virus is not very contagious and that most people who are infected do not develop severe symptoms.

Restricting visits to nursing homes is one way to keep Americans healthier, according to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Former CDC director Tom Frieden on Wednesday said it's time to restrict visits to nursing homes as the agency focuses on dementia and other complex mental illnesses.  The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it’s time to restrict visits to nursing homes.  The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it's time to restrict visits to nursing homes because of safety concerns. Dr. Tom Frieden says more needs to be done to improve safety in the long-term care facilities. He made the comments in an interview with The Miami Herald. Frieden is stepping down from his post at the CDC next month.  This will probably surprise no one, but the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advocating for a limit on visits to nursing homes. Dr. Tom Frieden, who has held the position since early 2013, made the comments in an interview with The New York Times. Frieden said that the trend of people living longer, healthier lives has led to an increase in the number of people in nursing homes. ""We need to start planning for a world where more people are living in nursing homes, not less,"" he said. The problem, Frieden said, is that the trend is unsustainable. ""We're going to need to think about what it means for Medicaid, for Medicare, for Social Security when more and more people are living into their 80s and 90s,"" he said.   The number of people in nursing homes is projected to rise from 5.9 million in 2013 to 7.4 million by 2020, Frieden said. He said that the CDC is working on a variety of ways to address the issue, including developing better long-term care policies and increasing funding for home and community-based care.']",

In what appears to be a new normal, coronavirus outbreaks continue to show no sign of slowing down.  Since September, WHO has responded to 274 confirmed or probable coronavirus cases (excluding those from the Saudi Arabia case cluster), of which 149 (51%) have resulted in death. In the same period in 2018, WHO responded to 278 confirmed or probable coronavirus cases, of which 168 (60%) resulted in death. The increase in cases reflects increased awareness and reporting, as well as the continued spread of the virus across the world.  Of the confirmed cases, 84% have been reported from just five countries: Saudi Arabia (95 cases), Jordan (19 cases), Nigeria (14 cases), Thailand (12 cases) and United Arab Emirates (seven cases). The WHO has warned that the virus is spreading rapidly through contact with respiratory secretions, and that there is a risk of additional cases occurring in other countries in which it has not been yet identified.  The virus has been fatal in nearly half of all cases, with the most severe cases causing pneumonia, meningitis and even encephalitis, which can result in death. The most common symptoms are cough, fever and shortness of breath. Untreated, the virus can quickly become deadly.  There is no specific treatment for the virus, and there is currently no vaccine available. Clinicians are currently using antibiotics and other treatments as needed to manage the symptoms of the virus.  WHO is engaging with member states to rapidly scale up support for health systems in affected countries, including for key areas such as road safety, epidemiological surveillance, laboratory capacity and risk communication. concerted global response is essential to prevent future outbreaks and save more lives.']",

What is the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic? 5. What is the possible source of the coronavirus? 6. How is the coronavirus spread?  1. Can coronavirus infect my lungs?  No, coronavirus cannot infect the lungs. The virus primarily replicates in the respiratory tract, and can cause serious respiratory illness in people of all ages. However, there is currently no evidence that coronavirus can be spread from person to person through respiratory secretions, such as mucus.  2. What causes the high morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus infection?  The high morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus infection is due, in large part, to the inability of the virus to be spread through casual contact. The virus is highly contagious, and can quickly spread through close contact with an infected person, such as through coughing and sneezing. Outbreaks of coronavirus infection often occur in densely populated areas, where close contact between people is common.

416,Coronavirus myths and misinformation,"['Myth: A coronavirus causes the common cold.  Fact: A coronavirus is believed to cause a number of respiratory illnesses, including the common cold, but it is not the only cause. Other viruses, shared environment exposures, and other medical conditions can also cause the common cold.  Myth 1: The coronavirus is only an airborne virus and cannot be spread through water or other surfaces.  False. The virus can be spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva, mucus, and blood, from an infected person. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, such as doorknobs, countertops, and door handles. Rarely, the virus may be spread through contact with contaminated food.  Myth 2: There is no treatment for the coronavirus and people who are infected will eventually die from the virus.  False. There is currently no known cure for the coronavirus, but the virus can be treated with antiviral drugs. Some people who become infected with the virus may experience mild symptoms that may eventually progress to more severe symptoms, but most people who are infected will not develop severe symptoms. In some cases, people who are infected with the virus may experience a mild respiratory infection, but no other health complications.  Myth 3: The coronavirus is a new virus that has recently emerged and is causing a global pandemic.  False. The coronavirus is a virus that has been around for centuries and has been reported in a number of different countries over the past few years. In fact, the first cases of the virus were reported in 2012, but the number of cases has surged in recent months. However, it is still unclear how widespread the virus is and whether it is causing a global pandemic.']",

The researchers found that those who took fish oil supplements had a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and mortality overall. They also found that the lower risk was strongest among individuals who were not overweight or obese.  The study authors say that the findings “support the potential cardioprotective effects of fish oil supplements and suggest that greater intake may be beneficial.”   fish oil supplements can be found in the health food section of most stores.

419,Your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk,"['Widespread media coverage of the obesity epidemic has led to an increased focus on waist size and its relation to heart disease risk. However, research has shown that weight is more important than waist size when it comes to predicting heart disease risk.  Your waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk. A study published in the journal Circulation found that men who have a waist size greater than 33 inches (84 cm) and women who have a waist size greater than 26 inches (66 cm) are at a greater risk of having a heart attack.  A study by the European Society of Cardiology found that people with a waist size greater than 33 inches had a threefold increased risk of heart attack, compared to those with a waist size of 23 inches or less. The study also found that people with a waist size greater than 37 inches had a sixfold increased risk of heart attack.    This is a controversial topic. Some studies suggest that waist size may be more important than weight for multiple heart attack risk. Other studies say that weight is more important.  That’s a surprising statement, but there is some evidence that your waist size may be more important than your weight for multiple heart attack risk.  Multiple heart attacks are caused by the buildup of blood clots in the arteries of the heart. The heavier you are, the more likely it is that you will have these clots. However, research has shown that your waist size is a better predictor of heart attack risk than your weight.  One study found that people who had a waist size above 37 inches (94 cm) were two times as likely to have a heart attack than people with a waist size below 26 inches (66 cm). And a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that people who had a waist size of greater than 40 inches (102 cm) were three times as likely to have a heart attack as people with a waist size of less than 32 inches (81 cm).  So, it appears that your waist size is more important than your weight for multiple heart attack risk. If you are worried about your risk of heart disease, it is important to be mindful of your waist size and to make lifestyle changes if needed to lower your risk.']",

422,Exercise advice on food labels could help reduce obesity,"['and heart disease  There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to reduce obesity and heart disease depends on the individual's specific lifestyle and health risks. However, some general advice on food labels that could help reduce obesity and heart disease include:  - Avoid processed foods and foods high in sugar and saturated fat. These foods are often high in calories and contribute to weight gain and heart disease.  - Eat more fruits and vegetables. These foods are packed with nutrients and antioxidants that can help protect against obesity and heart disease.  - Avoid eating too much salt. Too much salt can increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems.  - Consider using diet or fitness supplements to help boost your overall health and reduce your risk of obesity and heart disease. These supplements can provide essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that can help reduce your risk of these diseases.  There is no single answer to reducing obesity, as different people will require different approaches. However, nutrition labeling could be useful in helping people make informed decisions about what to eat.  Labels should list the calories, nutrients, and types of fats and proteins in food. They should also list any added sugars. Eating too many calories and not getting the nutrients that you need can lead to weight gain.  Foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients are often unhealthy and can contribute to obesity. For example, processed foods and sugary drinks are often high in calories and low in nutrients.  Food labels can help you make healthy choices. If you are looking for a healthy snack, for example, try to choose foods that are high in nutrients and low in calories.']",

Researchers found that teens who spend a lot of time on social media tend to have lower self-esteem and feel less connected to others. Additionally, these teens are also more likely to have problems with cyberbullying, social Comparison and body image issues.  According to a study published in ""JAMA Pediatrics,"" teenagers who use social media may be more likely to experience mental health problems if they disengage from activities that used to provide pleasure and satisfaction.  The study surveyed 1,969 American teenagers, who were asked about their social media use, mental health, and physical health. Those who used social media more than three times a day were found to be more than twice as likely as those who used it less than once a month to report symptoms of anxiety, depression, and self-injury.  While the study cannot say for certain that social media use is causing these mental health problems, it does suggest that the two are associated and that more research is needed to understand the full impact social media may have on teenagers' mental health.  There is evidence that social media use may harm teenagers' mental health by disrupting positive activities.

In 2017, the life expectancy for women was 82.3 years, an increase from 81.9 years in 2016 and from the previous high of 81.5 years in 2014. For men, life expectancy increased from 79.6 years in 2016 to 79.9 years in 2017.  The report attributes the increase in life expectancy for women to decreases in deaths from both cancer (down 6%) and heart disease (down 5%). Deaths from lower respiratory infections and unintentional poisoning decreased for both men and women, but deaths from homicide, suicide, and accidental poisoning increased for women.  The life expectancy of people in the UK has increased for the first time in four years, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.  From April 2014 to April 2015, the life expectancy of men increased by 0.7 years and that of women by 0.5 years.  This is the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1911.  The figures show that the number of men who can expect to live to 80 years increased by almost 3,000, and the number of women who can expect to live to 85 years increased by almost 2,000.  Commenting on the figures, Office for National Statistics (ONS) Life expectancy statistics editor Sarah Knapton said: “These figures show that, for the first time in four years, life expectancy is increasing for both men and women in the UK.  “The improvements are likely to be the result of increased prevention and treatment of disease, as well as improvements in the quality of life and the overall environment in which we live.”  The ONS said that while there are still significant differences between life expectancy for men and women, the gap is gradually closing.  For example, in 1911, men could expect to live to an average of 75 years and women to an average of 82 years. By 2015, these figures had increased to 79 years for men and 85 years for women.']",

So if you're concerned about your child's behavior or school performance, it might be a good idea to monitor their screen time and take steps to reduce or limit it if necessary.']",
436,Being happier will help you live longer,"['This is an old wives’ tale that has been disproven time and time again. While it is possible that being happier will lead to a longer life, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. In fact, research suggests that there is no link between happiness and lifespan.  There is plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that people whoReport feeling happier in their lives tend to outlive those who report feeling less happy.  A large study of over a million people found that people who reported feeling more happy had a 22% lower risk of death from any cause, and a 40% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.  Another study found that people who reported feeling less happy tended to have a higher risk of death from all causes, even after adjusting for factors like smoking and obesity.  So if you want to live a long and happy life, it's definitely worth looking into strategies that will make you happier.  There is some evidence to suggest that people who are happier tend to live longer, largely due to improved emotional health. People who are happier are more likely to have better physical health, lower rates of obesity, and a lower incidence of chronic diseases. Additionally, being happier has been shown to lead to a reduced likelihood of suicide, improved social well-being, and increased productivity. While the precise mechanisms by which happiness leads to longer lives remain unknown, it is likely that happier people have more balanced lives with more positive experiences than unhappy people. In short, while there is no single cause of long life, including overall happiness, it is clear that a happy and healthy life is strongly linked to good health and a longer life.']",
437,Mixing less than 6 hours of sleep with chronic disease is deadly combo,"['Many chronic diseases are linked with lack of sleep, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and even depression. People who mix less than six hours of sleep with chronic disease are up to three times more likely to develop one of these conditions.  Too much sleep can increase the risk of chronic disease and death, according to a study published in the journal Sleep.  The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that people who consistently sleep less than six hours a night are at an increased risk of death from any cause, as well as from chronic diseases such as heart disease and stroke.  The study also found that this deadly combination is especially dangerous for people who are already at a high risk for chronic disease.  ""People who are already predisposed to chronic disease are especially at risk for negative health consequences from insufficient sleep,"" said study author Dr. Karlis Osis, a geriatrician and director of the University of California, San Francisco Sleep Disorder Center. ""Our findings underscore the importance of getting enough sleep for healthy people of all ages.""  The study used data from the University of California, San Francisco San Francisco cohort, a group of more than 4,000 participants aged 50 and older. The researchers used information on participants' sleep habits, health status, and the prevalence of chronic diseases.  The researchers found that people who slept less than six hours a night were more than three times as likely as those who slept seven or more hours a night to die from any cause. They were also more than twice as likely to die from chronic diseases.  People who slept six hours or less were also more than twice as likely to die from diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.  ""We need to start addressing chronic health conditions not only by providing education and healthcare, but also by making sure that people are getting enough sleep,"" said Osis. ""Clearly, sleep is an important factor in overall health and well-being.""  The study authors note that there are many factors that could contribute to the link between sleep and health, including obesity and chronic diseases. They suggest that future research should focus on identifying which factors are most influential in predicting sleep health outcomes.']",

Daylight saving time can lead to an increase in anxiety because it disrupts the natural sleep schedule. Anchored to a certain time of day, people with anxiety may find it harder to fall asleep at night when the sun goes down and may be more likely to wake up in the middle of the night due to anxiety. Additionally, when Daylight Saving Time ends, people may feel an intense rush of energy and wake up early the next morning, which can lead to difficulty getting back to sleep..

Researchers from the University of Utah, who published their findings in the journal Chemical Senses, say the findings could help to explain why babies smell so tantalizing to adults.  The team first investigated how a baby's scent differed from that of an adult. They found that the baby's scent molecules combined with chemicals in the adults' noses to create the smell of sweetness.  The team then asked participants to smell both a baby's and an adult's sweat samples and to rate the sweetness of the smells. They found that the sweat samples of adults who smelled the baby's sweat smelled sweeter than those of adults who smelled the adult's sweat.  The team says their findings could help to explain why infants smell so tantalizing to adults. They believe that the scent of sweetness may be the key factor in making babies smell so appealing to adults.']",

480,Once the Amazon rainforest passes the point of no return it could be gone in decades,"['Scientists say if the Amazon rainforest continues to be destroyed at its current rate it could be gone in decades.  The Amazon rainforest is vast and incredibly complex. It's home to more than 1 million species of plants and animals, and it's estimated to be home to around 20% of the planet's plant and animal species. If the Amazon rainforest passes the point of no return, it could be gone in decades – but we need to do everything we can to stop that from happening.  The Amazon rainforest could be gone within decades, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. If current trends continue, researchers said the forest could be completely gone by the end of the century.  The study uses a computer model to examine how deforestation in the Amazon is linked to global climate change. The model predicts that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase at their current rate, the Amazon rainforest could be gone by the end of the century.  “Deforestation in the Amazon is one of the largest contributors to global climate change, and we need to do more to prevent it,” said study author and University of Maryland climate scientist Michael R. Mann.  The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest on Earth and is a critical habitat for many endangered species, including the jaguar, the Garry oak tree and the Brazilian tapir.']",

García imagines a world in which women are treated as second-class citizens, segregated from men in all aspects of life. ""As women, we would need our own places where we could rest, study, socialize, and work: we would need our own hospitals, schools, and workplaces,"" he writes. ""These places could be created specifically for women, hidden behind a curtain of secrecy to protect us from male gaze and male domination.""  Although García's essay is focused on the negative consequences of a world without women, he argues that this is exactly the situation we currently find ourselves in.

The only light comes from the beacons of electronic gadgets that line the gutters like fluorescent flowers.  Makoko is a floating slum on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria. For more than two decades, it's been home to some of Nigeria's poorest and most vulnerable citizens, many of whom are fishermen.  But in recent years, Makoko has started to transform. Young adults are starting businesses and using technology to engage with the wider world.  ""Before, the community just used to sit around and talk,"" said Tendai Biti, one of Makoko's residents and the founder of the nonprofit organization Movement for Change. ""Now we use technology to connect with each other and the world.""  Makoko is one of dozens of slums that have sprung up around Lagos in recent years, as Nigeria's population has ballooned and the economy has improved. Unlike the densely populated neighborhoods of downtown Lagos, which are policed and monitored, the slums are largely self-governing.  This has created a fertile ground for entrepreneurship and innovation, something that has come in handy as Makoko has started to face some challenges.  For years, Makoko's fishermen have been struggling to find a place to fish in the city's expanding waters. In response, Biti and his colleagues have started a fleet of digital boats that provide surveillance of the harbor and mapping services to fishermen.  ""We're not just talking about mapping, we're talking about data analysis,"" Biti said.  Makoko is also hoping to benefit from Nigeria's digital revolution.

The statement also said that the lockdown is ""due to an incident that is currently under control.""  The South African embassy in Beijing has also released a statement confirming the lockdown and urging South African citizens in the city to follow the instructions of local authorities.  The Johannesburg-based South African Press Association has called for the evacuation of South Africans in the city of Wuhan in China following the outbreak of a pandemic. The Association said on Wednesday that the South Africans should leave China as soon as possible because of the risk of the virus spreading further.  According to Xinhua, the South African Embassy in Beijing said on Tuesday that there are around 100 South Africans in China who are at risk of contracting the disease. The embassy has not yet announced whether any of the South Africans have contracted the virus.  South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday that it is working closely with the Chinese government to ensure that the South Africans are safe.

508,Caught between roadblocks,"['A blocked road is a major frustration for drivers. It's often the result of an emergency or construction, and can cause major delays.  If you're caught in a traffic jam, be patient. The best thing to do is to stay in your car and wait for the traffic to move. If that's not possible, try to find an exit and walk. If that's still not possible, consider using public transportation or carpooling.  We're caught between roadblocks. The first roadblock is that we don't have enough money. The second roadblock is that we don't have enough manpower.  In China, there are frequent roadblocks erected by the authorities to control the movement of people and goods. This creates significant logistical challenges and can be frustrating for those who are trying to travel.   When someone is caught between two roadblocks, they are unable to move forwards or backwards. This can be a problem because it means that the person is unable to do anything.  Many small businesses find themselves caught in the crossfire of regulations and protests from environmental groups. These groups typically demand stricter environmental regulations in exchange for limiting their potential damage to the environment. Businesses typically find that they cannot afford to meet the environmental standards demanded by these groups, which compounds the problem.  Lack of investment  Some experts argue that the primary reason small businesses struggle is because of a lack of available investment. Large businesses can typically afford to invest in new technology and other growth initiatives, which can help them stay ahead of the competition. This is not the case for many small businesses, which often find that they must depend on older technologies and methods in order to stay afloat.  Lack of skills  Another common challenge that small businesses face is a lack of skills within their employees. Many small businesses are started by individuals who have a great deal of personal experience in their field, but few employees have the requisite skills to help run the business effectively. This can lead to operational problems and a lack of growth.  Lack of resources  Finally, many small businesses find that they do not have the resources necessary to compete in the market. Many small businesses do not have the purchasing power or the distribution channels that are available to larger businesses. This can make it difficult for these businesses to compete on a level playing field, which can lead to a lack of success.']",

But in some states, there's a fear that the census might not be accurate.  The Civil Rights Project at UCLA is working to get a better understanding of the issue.  Their research has found that a large number of people in minority communities don't participate in the census.  Jeana Smith, a Policy Analyst with the Civil Rights Project, says these communities often have a low response rate because they don't trust the government.  ""We know that in certain minority communities, especially communities of color, there's a lot of mistrust of the government. So if they're not confident that the census is going to be accurate or fair, they're not going to participate,"" she says.  Smith says that this lack of participation can have a lot of implications.  ""If the census is inaccurate, then it could mean that certain populations that are historically underrepresented in our government are going to be even further underrepresented,"" she says.  Smith says that the civil rights project is working with community groups in minority communities to try to help them feel more confident about participation in the census., with over 165 million households participating.  The census is designed to help states, localities, and the federal government to plan for funding, infrastructure, and services.

In the memo, Biden aides lay out the case for why Sanders would have an extremely difficult time catching up to Clinton if he does not win a majority of pledged delegates by the end of the primary process.  The memo, authored by Biden's campaign manager, Robby Mook, points to polls that show Sanders trailing by large margins among key demographic groups, including African Americans and Latinos.  It also argues that Sanders is not generating the same level of enthusiasm in the Democratic primary as Clinton, who has led in virtually every poll since early 2015.

""It is offensive that the Biden campaign would write a document that is filled with falsehoods and misleading attacks,"" Weaver said in a statement.

Many people are blaming the NCAA for not having a men’s basketball championship this year, but the decision to cancel the tournament was in the best interest of the athletes.  The NCAA is a governing body for collegiate sports, and they are responsible for creating a fair and competitive environment for the athletes. By having a championship game, the NCAA would be promoting a level of competitiveness that is not necessary.  The tournament has becomeincreasingly expensive and there is a risk of injury. The players who make it to the championship game are typically the best players in the country, and the competition can be very intense.  By cancelling the tournament, the NCAA will be able to focus on other competitions that are more important. There are a number of tournaments that take place throughout the year, and the NCAA is able to give the athletes a fair chance to compete in them.']",

Trump has thus far decided not to take any precautions against the virus, including getting vaccinated, and is at risk of becoming infected if he travels to an area affected by the virus.    There is no 100% assurance that the coronavirus that has killed a number of people in the Middle East won’t cross the Atlantic and cause a pandemic in the United States. In the past, diseases like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza have killed tens of thousands of people, most of whom were not vaccinated or had no genetic resistance to the infections.  So far, there have only been a handful of cases of coronavirus, all in people who have traveled to the Middle East, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not yet issued any formal travel warnings. However, CDC Director Tom Frieden said, “The risk of a severe coronavirus pandemic in the United States is real and we are taking it very seriously.”  Even if the virus does not spread widely, there is always the possibility that a person will become infected and develop severe symptoms, which could lead to death. In light of this risk, it is important for the public to be aware of the symptoms of coronavirus and to know how to protect themselves.

One of Wei's latest projects is a replica of the 16th-century Portuguese carrack Sao Paulo, which was wrecked on the coral reefs of the Macao Archipelago in 1592.  Wei has spent years painstakingly recreating the ship's hull and decking out the model with detailed miniatures of cannons, sails, and tackle. He's even built a replica of the ship's bell.

For Australian designer and founder of label 8ointed, Lauri Tähtivaara, her first fashion show in 2010 was a resounding success. The show, which was staged at Melbourne’s Crown Casino, showcased the inaugural collection of the label, which was designed to modernize the classic A-line silhouette.  “I was really nervous leading up to the show, but it was such a great experience,” recalls Tähtivaara. “There was a really positive energy in the air, and the response from the attendees was amazing.”  Since then, 8ointed has become a leading name in contemporary fashion, with its collections seen in high-end stores all over the world.

628,'Beauty is freedom': The North Korean millennials wearing makeup to rebel against the state,"['When North Korean millennials start wearing makeup to rebel against the state, they're not just becoming more visible to the rest of the world. They're also becoming more vulnerable to the government's surveillance.  The Guardian reports that the makeup trend is part of a wider social movement in North Korea that includes using foreign cell phones and listening to South Korean music.  ""For these people, their appearance is a way of asserting their independence and asserting their own conception of themselves,"" said Robert Kelly, a professor at Pusan National University in South Korea who has been studying North Korean society for more than two decades.  The state regulates North Korean society through a variety of controls, including clothing and hairstyles. For North Korean millennials, wearing makeup is a way of standing out and expressing their opinions, even if it puts them at risk.  ""There is a kind of courage and political consciousness that comes with these expressions of defiance,"" said Kelly.  When North Korean millennials start rebelling against the state by wearing makeup, the country's ruling elite can only sit and watch.  Since North Korea is one of the few countries where women are not allowed to wear makeup, the trend among the young North Koreans is a defiant show of individuality and self-expression.  ""The reason [young North Koreans] are wearing makeup is because they want to defy the authorities, to show they are not afraid of anything,"" said Park Hee-jung, a South Korea-based human rights lawyer who has worked extensively with North Korean refugees.  ""For them, it's a way to show they're not just mindless drones. They're asserting their own identity.""  The trend began to emerge in South Korea a few years ago, where the limited availability of cosmetics and restrictions on how women can dress has sparked a fashion revolution among the youth.  But the North Koreans have taken the trend to a completely different level by making bold and eye-catching expressions of their personal style.  Some North Koreans are even wearing makeup to work, in defiance of rules that prohibit students from engaging in any form of leisure activities outside of school.  ""They want to be sexually liberated as well, but that's still a taboo subject in North Korea,"" Hee-jung said.  ""Wearing makeup is a way of asserting their own power and sexuality.""  But despite the growing liberalization of North Korea's society, the country's ruling elite will likely remain largely untouched by the trend.  This is because the North Korean millennials who are wearing makeup are not the activist youth who are trying to overthrow the regime, but rather the average young people who are just trying to get by in a society that is repressive and closed off from the rest of the world.  ""The ruling elite is living in a totally different world where they're wearing high-end clothes and eating sumptuous food,"" Hee-jung said.  ""They won't be affected by this rebellious trend among the millennials, because they're not the ones who are suffering the most.""']",

It’s not that outlandish to think that we could go through another apocalypse.”  Blackman says that the wealthy are preparing for a variety of potential disasters, including economic collapse, pandemics, and civil unrest.  “Some people are stockpiling food and ammo in case of a pandemic or economic collapse, and others are buying property in rural areas or near mountains so that they would have a place to go if the world went to hell in a hand basket,” he says.

646,Children displaced in the Boko Haram conflict are on a path to success thanks to a school prioritizing peace,"['Nine years after Boko Haram terrorists kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, northeastern Nigeria, the girls have returned to their classrooms. And credit goes to a peace-building school in their hometown of Maiduguri, which has worked diligently to ensure that these girls--and all displaced schoolchildren--benefit from a quality education.  The school, which has been named the Chibok Girls’ Peace School, depends on donations to continue its work. But the benefits to the girls have been undeniable.  ""Since coming to this school, the girls have started behaving well and making friends,"" said Fathima Shehu, one of the girls attending the school. ""They are also learning more, and I believe that this school is responsible for their change in attitude.""  The Chibok Girls’ Peace School is one of many peace-building initiatives taking root in the wake of Boko Haram. These initiatives have helped to break the cycle of violence and rebuild communities.  With the help of these schools, the displaced girls of Boko Haram are on a path to success.  When the government of Cameroon closed all schools in the country’s northeast region in early 2014 due to fighting between government forces and Boko Haram militants, hundreds of thousands of children were left without an education.  Some parents pulled their children out of school to protect them, while others said they didn’t have the money to send their children to school.  But many of these children – who make up the largest group of internally displaced persons in the world – were not able to resume their education after the schools reopened in late 2014.  That is, until a school in the town of Baga reopened in March 2016 with a new focus: peace.  Peacebuilding at the core  The new school, which is funded by the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF), is modeled after a Peace School in Lusaka, Zambia, which has successfully helped to achieve positive outcomes for children who have been forcibly displaced.  The Baga Peace School curriculum emphasizes the importance of building peace and Reconciliation  The Baga Peace School curriculum emphasizes the importance of building peace and Reconciliation skills among the students.  This includes topics like conflict resolution, human rights, and community organizing.  The school also emphasizes the importance of a healthy environment and sustainable development.  These topics are important not only because they can help students improve their lives, but also because they can help prevent conflict in the future.  So far, the school has been a success  So far, the school has been a success.  The majority of the students who have been enrolled in the school are boys, and most of them come from extremely poor families.  But the school has already helped them to improve their lives in a number of ways.  For example, the students are much more likely to be engaged in their education thanks to the peace curriculum.  And they are also much more likely to be interested in pursuing a career in peacebuilding.  The Baga Peace School is just one example of the success that can be achieved when schools are focused on peacebuilding.  It is important that other schools in the world adopt a similar curriculum in order to help children who have been displaced by conflict find a path to success.']",
647,Italy is a test of how a Western economy bear an almost-total shutdown,"['Italy is a good test of how a Western economy will fare when an almost-total shutdown occurs. It is a very wealthy country, with a GDP per capita of about $40,000, which is much higher than any other Western- industrialized country. The shutdown will cause a lot of people to lose their jobs, and the government will not be able to afford to provide unemployment benefits, social security, or other government services.  The shutdown will have a big impact on the Italian economy. GDP will decline by about 3 percent in the first quarter and by about 6 percent in the second quarter. The unemployment rate will also increase, from about 8 percent to about 11 percent. The government will have to borrow a lot of money to pay for the services that it is not able to provide, and the interest rates on these loans will increase. This will cause the Italian debt to continue to grow, and the country will eventually become much more indebted than it was before the shutdown.  Italy is a test of how a Western economy will cope with an almost-total shutdown.  The country is in the throes of its fourth general election in two years, and as polls closed at 8 p.m. local time on May 24, no party had enough seats to form a government. This means that Italy will have to wait until Tuesday, May 29, to find out who will be its new Prime Minister.  The country's previous Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, resigned on May 24 after losing a confidence vote in the Senate. His resignation leaves the country facing a potential protracted period of political instability.  Renzi's departure has raised fears that Italy could become the next country to fall into a prolonged economic crisis.

One of the key consequences of a prolonged shutdown in Italy could be a decline in the country's GDP. Italy's GDP is estimated to be around €2.2 trillion, and a decline in this figure could lead to a decline in the global economy as a whole.

655,Italy's nightmare is making me rethink life in rural Iowa,"['It's not completely fair to paint all Italians as one homogeneous bloc, but in my experience, the stereotype rings true. Italians are fiercely proud of their culture and often view themselves as tastemakers, which can make them difficult people to work with.   Italians also have a reputation for being laid-back and easygoing, but if you cross them, they can be relentless. They're also very family-oriented, which can make it difficult to establish or maintain relationships outside of their close-knit community.  All of these qualities can make it difficult to live in rural Italy, where things can feel quiet and isolated. And while it's great to have a relaxed attitude and a passion for your culture, it can be tough to adjust to the slower pace of life.  Overall, Italians are a great people, but they have their quirks, and living in Italy can be a challenging experience.  I have to preface this by saying that, while I love Italy, I do not know much about it. So, if my opinions veer off in a ridiculous or uninformed direction, that's on me.  Last night, I dreamed that Italy had a nightmare. In the dream, everything was crumbling. The buildings were falling down. The roads were crumbling. The water was turning to blood. And Italy, himself, was shaking and crying and begging for help.  I woke up feeling very worried and unsettled. It's not the first time I've had a dream like this – I often dream of the US being in a difficult or explosive situation – but it's the first time I've ever felt so urgently concerned about it.  Looking back on it, I can't help but think that my dream is a metaphor for Italy's current situation. Italy is a beautiful and fascinating country, but it's also struggling. The economy is shaky. The government is unstable. And the people are feeling vulnerable and scared.  It's a scary time to be living in Italy, and I have to wonder whether it's really worth it.']",

This is due to a number of reasons, including the fact that banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend money to female-owned businesses.  There are also a number of cultural reasons why women are less likely to become entrepreneurs. Some African societies are still patriarchal, which means that women are often not given the same opportunities as men to develop their skills and businesses.  There is work being done to Address these issues, and it is important that more women are given the opportunity to become successful business owners. Initiatives such as the FemaleEntrepreneurFund, which provides funding and support to female entrepreneurs, are important steps in the right direction.  Africa's female entrepreneurs are hindered by a lack of access to finance and resources, sexism and a lack of awareness of their potential, according to a new report.  The report, released Monday by the African Development Bank (ADB), found that 77 percent of female entrepreneurs in Africa cite a lack of access to finance and resources as a major barrier to starting and growing their businesses.  The ADB said that one of the main obstacles to female entrepreneurship in Africa is a lack of awareness of their potential.  ""What we have found, time and time again, is that women need to be believed in, and their potential needs to be tapped,"" ADB Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Michèle Flournoy, said in a statement.  ""Latin America and the Caribbean had a head start in terms of breaking through these barriers, but we must do more to empower African women to realize their ambitions.""  The report also found that sexism is a major obstacle to female entrepreneurship in Africa.  ""Gender inequality and discrimination are real and pervasive, and can impede the full realization of women's potential,"" the report noted. ""In many cases, women are not only prevented from starting businesses, but also from accessing resources and opportunities that would help them grow and succeed.""  The report also recommended that the government invest in programs to increase access to information and communication technologies, as well as in mentorship and training programs to help female entrepreneurs grow their businesses.']",

668,NATO Secretary General: Why we're in Afghanistan and what a peace deal could do,"['NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discusses the rationale for NATO's ongoing engagement in Afghanistan and the potential for a peace agreement between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said that NATO is in Afghanistan because the alliance is ""committed to peace and stability in the region"" and that a peace deal could bring a ""lasting solution"" to the country's long-running conflict.  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tells DW's Johannes Urbach why the alliance is still in Afghanistan and what a peace deal could mean for the country.  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discusses the rationale for NATO's involvement in Afghanistan and the prospects for success of a peace deal.  ""Afghanistan has been a crucible of global conflict, wounds and suffering since the end of the Cold War. Today, it is one of the most complex and fragile countries in the world. While the situation in Afghanistan is complex, it is also critical for the international community to focus on finding a negotiated solution.  ""In NATO, we are fully committed to Afghanistan and to the security of our allies and partners in the region. We are also committed to bringing about a negotiated solution to the conflict.

It is plausible that the Taliban would regain power if they were to win the election, as they have a strong support base. This could lead to an increase in violence and discrimination against women, as the Taliban are known for their fundamentalist views. in Afghanistan, it will almost certainly restart the war against the United States.  This is an overly-simplified and highly-anticipatory prediction. While it is possible that the Taliban would resume hostilities against the United States if they regained power, it is far from certain. In addition, it is also possible that the Taliban would not restart the war, given their stated commitment to peace negotiations. in Afghanistan, they would attack targets in the United States  There is no evidence that the Taliban will regain power in Afghanistan. In fact, they have been losing ground to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in recent years. If they did regain power, they would likely focus their attacks on targets in Afghanistan rather than the United States.']",

Donald Trump’s speech in Poland on Friday won’t erase his bumbling response to a coronavirus pandemic, experts said.  The Republican presidential nominee delivered a speech in Warsaw on Friday, the day after he was criticized for his initial reaction to the virus, which saw him incorrectly state that the US would be “totally immune” to the pandemic.  Trump was widely ridiculed for his comments, and he has since said that he would “much rather focus on the devastating effects of global terrorism”.  Experts said that Trump’s speech in Poland will not make amends for his earlier remarks.  “It’s unlikely that he will change his tune given that he’s been talking about this for weeks and has been widely panned for his earlier remarks,” Nicholas Watt, a security and defense analyst, told The Guardian.  “It’s possible that he will try to reassure the public that he’s taking the matter seriously, but I don’t think his speech will erase the criticism.”  Trump's coronavirus gaffe  There is no evidence that President Trump’s speech on the coronavirus will erase his bumbling response on the virus earlier this year.

He received only about 6% of the black vote, compared to about 24% he received from white voters. Sanders has said that he is proud to have won the support of black voters and that he will continue to campaign for them.  Bernie Sanders’ troubles with black voters are well-documented, and stem from his support for the Black Lives Matter movement and his reluctance to condemn the policy positions of Black Panther Party member Louis Farrakhan. Sanders also voted against the Fair Housing Act in 1988, a vote that some have linked to his current unpopularity with black voters.?  Some black voters may have felt that Sanders did not have a credible plan to address issues such as police brutality and racial inequality. Others may have felt that Sanders was not vocal enough about his support for black issues.  It's not just that Bernie Sanders didn't fare well with black voters in the Democratic primaries -- he didn't even bother trying.  Sanders, who is Jewish, has repeatedly come under fire for lacking an understanding of the black community. Earlier this year, Sanders responded to criticisms of his lack of outreach to black voters by saying that ""anybody who suggests that I don't know what I'm doing is wrong.""  Sanders' indifference to black voters is likely one of the reasons he didn't fare as well as he did with other demographics. According to the Washington Post, ""Sanders picked up only 6 percent of the black vote in the Democratic primaries, compared with Clinton's 83 percent.""  And even though Sanders has announced his support for Hillary Clinton, it's clear that he has a lot of work to do if he wants to win over black voters in 2020.']",

While the virus can be treated effectively with antibiotics, the virus can also be fatal in some cases.  Second, Trump claimed that the vaccine “works very well” and is “extremely effective.” There is no evidence to support these claims.

The president's insensitive tweet about the deadly coronavirus showed just how little he understands about the epidemic that's wreaking havoc in countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Buzz60  WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s seeming lack of empathy for victims of the highly contagious coronavirus is starting to weigh on the country, some say.  The president has made few public appearances since the virus surfaced earlier this year, instead resting and taking phone calls from world leaders about the fight against the virus.  “It’s very worrisome,” said Dr. Jennifer Cohn, a professor of clinical medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “He seems to be completely disengaged.”  Trump’s disdain for the health and well-being of Americans has been on display before. He has proposed slashing funds to the CDC by more than $300 million, which would seriously hamper its ability to investigate and protect people from infectious diseases.  He’s also proposed budget cuts that would reduce funding for the National Institutes of Health by more than $5 billion.  “The lack of empathy and compassion is really troubling,” Cohn said.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the president’s lack of engagement is misguided.  “The president has the responsibility to ensure that we have the best possible leadership for federal agencies,” Fauci said. “I don’t think this is the time for the president to be disengaged from the virus.”  Fauci said there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to fighting the virus, and that Trump should be supportive of the efforts of all agencies involved.  “We need all the assets we have,” Fauci said.

The issue with crony capitalism is that it allows a select few to unfairly benefit from government largesse. This can lead to less competition, poorer quality services, and corruption.  Given that women are often the victims of crony capitalism, it is no surprise that Buffett believes they are the best candidates to fix the problem. Women have a history of fighting for social justice and standing up for their rights. They are also well-versed in the ins and outs of business, which makes them ideal candidates to rein in the abuses of crony capitalism.  There is no easy answer to this question, as opinions will vary widely. However, in my opinion, it is important to create a level playing field where businesses are free to compete and succeed on their own merits.

In April, Biden traveled to Texas to give a speech at the Energy Independence Summit in Dallas. The speech was critically acclaimed, and Biden highlighted his concerns about the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.  “When I came to office, we were losing over 600,000 jobs a year,” Biden said. “Since I’ve been in office, we’ve created over a million jobs.”  Biden’s support for the energy industry has resonated with Texans, many of whom have seen their incomes stagnate or decline in the past few years. In a state with a heavily Republican lean, Biden’s appeal lies in his longtime record of fighting for middle-class families and his commitment to renewable energy.  “Joe Biden is a known commodity in Texas,” said Graham Wilson, a strategist for the progressive group Our Revolution. “He’s got a lot of credibility in this state because he’s been an advocate for progressive values his whole career.”  Biden is scheduled to visit Texas again this month to speak at the Texas Democratic Convention in Houston.']",

And I'm not just saying this because I myself am guilty of it. I believe that our society, particularly the way we raise our boys, is largely to blame.  We commonly teach our boys that money is everything, and that they need to be as successful as possible with it. This is done through ads and TV shows, where the heroes are always rich and the girls are always waiting on them hand and foot.  As a result, our boys come to believe that money is the key to happiness, and they search endlessly for ways to get more of it. This can have disastrous consequences for their relationships with women, as they start to view them as mere objects in their quest for wealth.  Sure, there are some good guys out there who understand that money isn't everything, and who are able to have healthy relationships with women. But by and large, we need to start talking to our girls about money more than we're currently doing. If we can help them understand that money isn't the be-all and end-all, then we've done a great job.']",

The experts agreed that bipartisan solutions are essential to resolving the nation’s many problems.  The Fractured America group is a good example of how citizens, businesses, and organizations can work together to solve problems. The group has already come up with several ideas for bipartisan solutions, and it will continue to work on them.  One idea is for the two parties to come together to create a national service plan. This plan would offer incentives to all Americans to volunteer their time and skills to help others.  Another idea is for the two parties to work together to create a national education plan. This plan would provide free or cheap college education for all Americans.  Overall, the Fractured America group is a great example of how people from different backgrounds can work together to fix the problems in our country. effective solutions  The Fractured America report released on September 12th by the think tank Third Way (PDF) provides a detailed and troubling picture of the current state of our society.

In theory, a third party could come to the rescue and broker a deal that leads to lower taxes and increased government spending while averting the economic calamity.  But this scenario remains highly unlikely. For one, the Republican Party is deeply divided over the extent to which any new negotiations should include tax hikes. And even if a third party could broker a deal, it’s highly unlikely that President Obama and the Democrats would agree to it.  Kathy Griffin: I have a solution.  Election integrity experts have already said that hacks into voting machines could result in election victories for Trump or Clinton being overturned.  The only way to ensure election integrity and protect against any potential hacks is to have a third party audit the voting machines and ensure that they're accurate.

715,Confronting the cult of partisan media,"['There is no doubt that partisanship has taken on a life of its own in the United States. Political partisanship has become so entrenched and pervasive that it has largely taken over from the objective reporting and analysis that used to be the norm in American journalism.  This problem is not limited to American journalism. The problem of partisan media is global.  The ideological division that has developed in the United States over the past several years is not a new phenomenon. It first emerged during the heated debates over the Iraq War. At that time, the Bush administration was aggressively promoting the war while many of its domestic critics were vehemently opposed.  As a result, the mainstream media was almost entirely committed to reporting the news in a way that served the administration's agenda. This pattern was repeated during the presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  During both campaigns, the media coverage was dominated by stories about the candidates' speeches, their policies, and their alliances with other politicians. Very little attention was given to the policies that either candidate was proposing or to the concrete proposals that they had put forward for reform.  The result was that the public had a very limited understanding of the candidates' proposals and little idea of the choices that they were making.  This problem is aggravated by the fact that the major media outlets are owned by large corporations that are motivated primarily by their own profits. These corporations are often reluctant to challenge the interests of their corporate clients or to take a stand on controversial issues.  As a result, the media is increasingly dominated by a tiny number of wealthy individuals and corporate interests. This concentration of power has produced a media system that is biased in favor of the interests of the American elites.  In addition, the rise of the Internet has made it easier for individuals to get their own independent sources of news and information. This has created a new generation of Americans who are completely ignorant of the political and economic realities of the world beyond the United States.  These trends have created a serious obstacle to the growth of democracy in the United States. They have also made it difficult for the public to have an informed discussion about the important issues of the day.  There is no easy solution to the problem of partisan media. But there are a number of things that can be done to address the problem.']",

735,Single,"['-shot breechloader  A single-shot breechloader is a firearm that uses one round of ammunition to discharge its contents. These firearms are most common in rifles, but can also be found in pistols, shotguns and machine guns.  Single-shot firearms, by definition, require manual reloading after each shot. This is accomplished by loading the chamber of the weapon with a new round of ammunition, inserting it into the breech, and firing. Since reloading a single-shot firearm requires both hands, it is not a practical option for many firearms, particularly those used in hunting or combat.  Single-shot firearms are generally less expensive to manufacture than firearms that use multiple rounds, and are also less complex to operate. This makes them popular choices for riflemen and target shooters who need a firearm that they can use quickly and efficiently.  5  Date  2015-06-06  Time  10:50 PM   1.

743,Why Trump hired Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz,"['Ken Starr was President Clinton's Independent Counsel and Alan Dershowitz was his main defender.  Hillary Clinton has said that her opponent, Donald Trump, hired lawyers who specialized in attacking her husband, Bill Clinton. Trump has offered multiple explanations for the choice of these lawyers, including the claim that he was simply looking for competent legal aides.  One of Trump's earliest hires was Kenneth W. Starr, who was Oklahoma's Solicitor General before becoming the independent counsel in 1994. Starr's investigation led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton, although the former president was never convicted of a crime.  Alan Dershowitz, another early Trump lawyer, is a well-known legal figure who defended Clinton during the impeachment trial. He has since become a critic of the current president, specifically criticizing his treatment of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.  In October 1995, President Bill Clinton appointed Ken Starr as Independent Counsel to investigate Whitewater, a real estate deal that had occurred while Clinton was governor of Arkansas. Starr hired renowned lawyer Alan Dershowitz to serve as his deputy.

More cracks are emerging in the wall of Republican support for President Donald Trump, as some key lawmakers voice deep concerns about his character and fitness for office.  The Washington Post reports that a growing number of GOP lawmakers are privately questioning Trump's ability to handle the demands of the presidency, citing his temperament, lack of experience and seeming disregard for the rule of law.  The Post reports that some GOP lawmakers are considering using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, though they don't have the votes to do so.  Trump has faced several high-profile investigations into possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice.  Donald Trump was supposed to be the GOP's presumptive nominee.  But cracks are emerging in his wall of support from Republican lawmakers and leaders.  After a string of primary defeats, Trump has been forced to fend for himself against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  And while he continues to win primary contests, recent polls suggest he is losing ground to the former secretary of state.  One lawmaker who has been a staunch supporter of Trump is Republican Senator Ted Cruz.  But Cruz has now come out against Trump as the nominee, saying he can't support him after he won't condemn support from white supremacists.  Trump has been dismissive of Cruz's decision, saying he won't support Cruz either if he wins the nomination.  But this is not the first time that Trump has been criticised by members of his own party.  In February, Senator Marco Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida primary to Trump.

The man, who was a germaphobe, is terrified that he will catch something while in the coma and thus dies.

After years of hard work and dedication, Biles made the US Olympic Team in 2011 and then quickly became a household name. She competed in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and won a total of four gold medals (two in the all-around competition, and two in the floor exercise). In addition, she also won five silver medals and two bronze medals.  While it is clear that Biles has a long way to go before she can be considered a complete Olympic champion, her story is an inspiring one of overcoming obstacles and achieving success. She credits her success to her foster care upbringing, which taught her to never give up and always strive for the best.']",
757,A dark matter hurricane is headed our way,"[', and it could be the most destructive storm in recorded history.  Scientists have been warning for years that the number of severe weather events is on the rise, and the latest evidence suggests that this may be due to the increasing impact of dark matter.  A new report published in the journal Nature has shown that when dark matter is added to computer models of large-scale weather, the disturbance can cause significantly more severe events.  “What we found was that when we include Dark Matter, the likelihood of severe events increases by a factor of two or more,” said study author Rolandutenberg.  So what is dark matter, and what does it have to do with storms?  Most scientists believe that dark matter exists, but we still don’t know what it is. It’s a mysterious form of matter that doesn’t interact with any other forms of energy, and so scientists have been unable to find a way to detect it.  However, according to the authors of the new study, the impact of dark matter on large-scale weather events is undeniable.  “Our study provides the first convincing evidence of the impact of dark matter on severe weather events,” said study author Rolandutenberg.  “Our results underscore the need for further research in this area, in order to understand the origin and potential consequences of this dark matter on earth’s climate.”  So what does this mean for the future?  If scientists are right, then the increasing number of severe weather events may be due to the increasing impact of dark matter.  And as the storm heading our way illustrates, this can be quite destructive – particularly if it hits a populated area.  So if you’re feeling anxious about the future, don’t forget about the impact of dark matter on the world around us. It could be a big reason why our climate is changing, and it’s something that we need to be aware of.']",
758,An Incredibly Fast 'Dark Matter Hurricane' Is Blowing Past Earth Right Now,"['A dark matter hurricane is blowing past Earth right now, and scientists are totally baffled by its existence.  The tornado-like plume of dark matter particles was first spotted by the Large Hadron Collider back in early March, and has been increasing in size ever since.  Although scientists don't yet understand what causes dark matter hurricanes, they're excited to study them further as they could potentially provide new insights into the nature of dark matter.  Dark matter is a mysterious substance that scientists believe accounts for much of the mass in the universe, but they've yet to confirm its existence with direct measurements.

Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have released a video of an incredibly fast dark matter hurricane whirling around the Milky Way.  According to the scientists, the dark matter hurricane is traveling at a whopping 800,000 miles per hour, or million miles per hour!  The hurricane was captured by NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory and recorded in a series of stunning images.  ""The Chandra data reveal a spiral structure in the gas and dust around the black hole,"" said study co-author Aaron Romanowsky of the University of California, Davis. ""This tells us that the dark matter hurricane is probably an effect of the black hole's mass and gravity, rather than being caused by the swirling motion of the gas and dust.""

761,How to prepare for ex-President Trump,"['There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the approach that is best for preparing for ex-President Trump may vary depending on your personal circumstances.

However, some tips on how to prepare for a potential Trump presidency may include:  1. Get involved in local and national political affairs. There is no guarantee that Trump will be elected, but getting involved in the political process and learning as much as you can about both the Democratic and Republican parties will give you a better sense of what is happening in Washington and will help you make informed choices when voting.  2. Maintain a positive attitude. Even if Trump is elected and carries out policies that you disagree with, it is important to maintain a positive attitude and focus on the things that you can control, such as your own personal life and how you approach conversations with others.  3. Be prepared to take action. No matter what the outcome of the 2016 election, it is important to be prepared to take action if Trump implements policies that you believe are harmful or oppressive. For example, if you believe that Trump's proposed immigration policies are discriminatory or harmful, you may want to start mobilizing opposition to them now.']",
762,Michael Cohen implicates Trump in hush money scheme,"['President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, implicates the president in a scheme to pay off two women to keep them silent about their affairs with Trump, according to a new report.  The report, from the New York Times, says that Cohen taped a conversation in which he and Trump discuss the payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal.  Cohen is also quoted as saying that he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006.  The report comes as Cohen is negotiating a possible plea deal with the feds.  Washington D.C. - Attorney Michael Cohen implicates President Donald Trump in a scheme to silence two women who alleged affairs with Trump, alleging that Trump directed Cohen to make a hush money payment to the women.  Cohen made the disclosure in a potential criminal proceeding in which he is expected to offer damning testimony Against Trump.  The New York Times reports:  In interviews and court filings, Mr. Cohen has implicated the president in a scheme to silence two women who had alleged affairs with Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump has strenuously denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, most recently in a statement on Thursday in which he attacked Mr. Cohen as a “rat” and a “liar.”  But Mr. Cohen said in a federal court filing on Tuesday that he had “made arrangements in the past” to pay women to stay silent about their affairs with Mr. Trump. He said one of the payments was made “for the principal purpose of influencing the election” and was ultimately failed.  The filings suggest that Mr. Cohen is poised to play a central role in any potential criminal case against Mr. Trump, although it is still unclear what charges, if any, Mr. Cohen might ultimately face.  The revelations could thrust the president into the center of a potential constitutional crisis. Mr. Cohen is likely to provide damning testimony about Mr. Trump’s intent when he directed him to make the payments. That testimony could place the president in significant legal jeopardy.']",

I think this is a plausible argument, especially considering the role that science has played in developing our technology and our economy. America was able to become a world leader in many industries because of the innovation and research that has been conducted here. Without science, our economy would be much smaller and less developed.  So, I would say that science made America great, and it is something that we should continue to focus on. We can't go back to the days when science wasn't a important part of our society, and we definitely don't want to see America fall behind in the world rankings because of it..  Wrong.  In fact, making America great was the result of America's greatness being built on the back of science and innovation. America became the world's leading economic and military superpower because we fostered an environment that encourages creativity, experimentation, and intellectual exploration.  Science and technology have always been key to our country's success. For centuries, Americans have used science and technology to find new ways to make our lives better. We've advanced medical technology, developed new crops and technologies, and created new methods of transportation and communication.  Science has also played an important role in our nation's defense. From the development of the atomic bomb to the invention of GPS and advanced computing, science has been essential to the military's efforts to protect our country.   Science has brought us so much happiness, too. We've been able to enjoy life more fully by potentially curing diseases and making life easier with technologies like the internet. Science has even led to some amazing discoveries that have changed the way we view the world, like the theory of evolution.  So, in a nutshell, science has made America great, and our greatness is the result of our science. Thank you, science!']",

Amidst the inauguration of President Donald Trump, many have been trying to make sense of Trump's policies and how the world will respond. Here's a look at some key factors:  Russia  Russia has been one of Trump's most outspoken critics since he entered office, with the two leaders often fraying over the U.S. missile strike on Syria. Trump has also expressed a desire to improve relations with Moscow, even as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in an attempt to help Trump win.  China  China has been Trump's biggest economic supporter since he took office, with Beijing agreeing to invest more than $350 billion in the U.S. economy in the coming years. However, Beijing may be disappointed with Trump's decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and his hardline stance on trade with China.  North Korea  Trump's relationship with North Korea has been one of the most closely watched in recent years. Trump has repeatedly called for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons program and has threatened military action if necessary. However, Trump has also signaled a willingness to work with North Korea if it agrees to denuclearize.  Israel  Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel, calling for stronger ties between the U.S. and the Jewish state. Trump has also signaled a willingness to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that would likely inflame tensions with the Palestinian Authority.']",
774,David Axelrod: Obama's legacy can't be erased,"[', but it can be tarnished  Former White House senior adviser David Axelrod believes the Obama presidency will be remembered more for the lows than the highs.  After eight years of being in the White House, one thing is for certain: President Barack Obama's legacy will be remembered.  From his historic presidential election in 2008 to his unstinting support of women's rights, gay rights and multiculturalism, Obama was a leader in pushing the country in a new direction.  The president also helped solidify the U.S. economy, while altering relations with Moscow and Beijing.  But despite his successes, Obama's legacy is not without its critics.  Critics say the president's healthcare reform law was too expensive and that his administration hasn't done enough to address income inequality.  Nevertheless, Obama leaves office with a very clear record of accomplishment and a lasting imprint on American politics., but he shouldered much of the blame  President Obama's legacy is something that will be debated long after his time in office ends. But his decision to enter into the Syrian civil war was a mistake that can't be erased.  My colleague Ezra Klein has asked a great question: What is Obama's legacy? And the answer, I think, is not so clear. Obama is remembered very fondly by many people on the left, who see him as a president who expanded healthcare coverage, presided over the recovery from the Great Recession, and advanced social liberalism. But there are also a lot of people on the right who view Obama as a president who hamstrung the free market, raised taxes, and expanded the role of the federal government.  So if we're looking for Obama's legacy to be one thing, it's probably not clear. But if we're looking for his legacy to be the sum total of all his policies, then it would be difficult to argue that it isn't a mixed bag.']",

Currently, there are more than 30 million people living with HIV, and there is no evidence to suggest that Zika could effectively replace HIV as the main global health threat.  There is no evidence linking Zika virus to any serious health conditions. Zika is similar to other viruses in that it can be spread through contact with infected fresh blood, urine, saliva, or semen. However, Zika virus is not related to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. There is currently no cure or prevention for Zika virus, and there is no vaccine available. Anyone who is in an area where the virus is being spread should take steps to avoid being infected, such as using insect repellent and wearing mosquito repellent.']",

Maybe it's time to focus on the economic opportunities that still exist. — Donald J.

He has repeatedly attacked people he doesn't agree with and has shown himself to be a very petty and vindictive person.  There's no denying that President Donald Trump has a propensity for stirring up controversy and bringing out the worst in people. From his often racist and homophobic rhetoric to his ongoing attacks on the media and the independence of federal judges, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding and respect for fundamental democratic values.  His repeated controversial actions and comments have had a profoundly negative impact on the U.S. political and social landscape, igniting public protests and sparking substantial concern among global allies and even some within Trump's own party.  Trump's volatile character and willingness to stir up controversy have often led to his being attacked and despised by the majority of Americans, even those who voted for him.

It is important to remember that the First Amendment does not protect stupidity or offensive speech.

There is no explicit promise in the Constitution that the First Amendment will be safe from Donald Trump. However, the amendment does protect speech and expression from government interference.

At the time, I couldn’t have put into words how much this conversation resonated with me. It was probably because I had been through something similar myself. The thing is, I wasn’t the only one.  Since then, I’ve come to learn that bullying is not just a playground gossip topic exclusive to school children. It’s an issue that affects people of all ages and intersects with a whole range of social, emotional and physical issues. In fact, many experts believe that bullying is a major factor in the development of chronic mental health problems like anxiety, depression and substance abuse.  So What Does This Mean for the Victims of Bullying?  It means that we need to be more aware and sensitive to the experiences of those who are victims of bullying. In addition, we need to find ways to support and protect these individuals from the harmful and corrosive effects of bullying.  Fortunately, there are many ways that we can start to address this issue. For example, we can create a positive school climate that is supportive and safe for all students. We can also promote anti-bullying policies and initiatives across all levels of society. And, last but not least, we can provide support and resources to victims of bullying so that they can rebuild their lives.']",

800,Why the Current Crop of Twentysomethings Are Going to Be Okay -- New York Magazine,"['It's the economy, stupid  Darn it, no  The Current Crop of Twentysomethings Are Going to Be Okay  Article by Frances C. Moore  Photo by Thinkstock  The thing about being a twentysomething is that you kind of assume that things will keep going the way they have for the past decade or so. Sure, there were some bumps in the road, but now things are finally getting good. Right?  Actually, no.  According to a recent report by financial website Bankrate.com, the current crop of twentysomethings is facing some serious economic troubles. Specifically, young people are struggling to get good jobs, pay off student loans, and save for a rainy day. In fact, the report found that 26 percent of people aged 20 to 24 are currently living in poverty, which is up from 19 percent a few years ago.  So what's going on?  The main culprit appears to be the current economy. According to the report, joblessness among twentysomethings is far higher than it was a few years ago, and the unemployment rate for people in that age group is actually greater than it is for any other age group. In addition, many twentysomethings are also stuck in low-paying jobs, which means that they're barely scraping by and aren't able to save any money.  In other words, the current economy isn't helping twentysomethings in the same way that it has helped past generations. And as the economy continues to worsen, that could have serious consequences for these young people.  Fortunately, things may not be as bad as they seem. It's true that twentysomethings are facing some tough times, but there are still plenty of opportunities available to them. In fact, the report found that the number of jobs for young people is increasing, and many young people are now able to support themselves without relying on their parents.  So don't be too concerned about the current crop of twentysomethings. They'll be okay.']",
801,My argument with Justice Antonin Scalia (Opinion),"['Justice Antonin Scalia wrote an opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges. In it, he argues that the Constitution does not grant same-sex couples the right to marry. Although the reasoning behind his opinion is flawed, he does make some valid points.  One of the most important arguments Scalia makes is that the Constitution does not grant same-sex couples the right to marry because marriage is a matter of state legislature. He argues that the Constitution does not provide a mechanism for the federal government to intervene in this issue.  However, Scalia does make some valid points. He argues that marriage is a key part of society and should be left up to the states. He also argues that, because marriage is a state issue, Same-sex couples should be able to marry in all states.  Ultimately, Scalia's opinion is flawed because it is based on faulty reasoning. However, his points are important and deserve to be considered.  Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion in the case of Kelo v. City of New London, argues that the use of eminent domain to take private property for a private benefit is not unconstitutional. Scalia argues that the Fifth Amendment does not protect property rights inprivate land, and that the use of eminent domain is justifiable as a way to bring economic development to a community.']",
802,Dear Ted Cruz...,"['You and I share a lot in common, most notably our love of Jesus Christ and our desire to live a righteous life. I believe that you have the potential to be a great leader and to make a real difference in this country, and I want to help you achieve both of these goals.  First and foremost, I believe that you need to focus on building a strong relationship with God. Too often, politicians focus on things outside of themselves, which can lead to poor decision-making. The Bible says that “The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked: who can know it?” (Jeremiah 17:9) If you are going to lead this country, you need to rely on God for guidance, strength, and wisdom.  Second, I believe that you need to focus on growing your faith. In the past, you have shown great promise as a leader by speaking out strongly against wasteful government spending and for fiscal responsibility. As President, I know that you will be a strong advocate for the principles of the Bible, including the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Finally, I believe that you need to focus on building a positive relationship with the American people. Too often, politicians focus on creating enemies instead of building partnerships. The Bible says that “The people who love peace will be hated by others. But he who loves truth and peace will be loved by everyone.” (John 14:27) I believe that you can lead this country in a positive direction by reaching out to all Americans, including the media, business people, and everyday citizens.

806,How 'Back to the Future' blew it,"['In the 1980s, Hollywood studios were looking for something that could replicate the success of ""Star Wars"" and ""E.T."" They found it in ""Back to the Future.""  The movie was not a hit when it was released, but it became a blockbuster later on when it was re-released with added effects. The movie's big mistake was not developing a sequel.  The popular science fiction movie ""Back to the Future"" was released in 1989 and it popularized the use of time travel. Despite the popularity of the movie, the use of time travel in fiction has been generally unsuccessful.  One of the main problems with time travel in fiction is that it is often difficult to convincingly execute. In ""Back to the Future"", for example, the character Marty travels back in time and is able to easily interact with people and gadgets from his own time period. However, this level of realism is not always possible or desirable in fiction, and can often create confusion or disbelief among the audience.  Another issue with time travel in fiction is that it is often used to resolve plot holes or inconsistencies in the story. In ""Back to the Future"", for example, the fact that Marty travels back in time and is able to fix the timeline allows the movie to resolve the mystery of the missing father and the change in career of the teenage Doc. However, this resolution is often not possible in reality, and can lead to plot holes or inconsistencies in the story.  Finally, time travel in fiction can often be confusing or mysterious, which can alienate some audiences. In ""Back to the Future"",, for example, the use of time travel is generally not explained in detail, which can lead to confusion among the audience.']",
807,I was the unpopular kid. Now I'm a parent. Here's what I learned.,"['1. It's tough to be the kid who everyone hates. But it's even tougher to be the parent who everyone hates.  2. When your kid is unpopular, it's important to remember that they're just doing their best.  3. It's important to have a good sense of humor about things. Otherwise, you'll start to feel really bad about yourself.  4. It's important to find your own friends. Unless your kid is really popular, they're probably not going to have many friends their own age.  5. It's important to be patient. Most kids will eventually get over being unpopular.  1. You don't have to be popular to be a good parent.  2. Parenting is a lot harder than you think.  3. You have to have a lot of patience.  4. You have to be willing to sacrifice a lot.  5. Parenting is not always easy, but it's Worth it!  1. You're not alone.  As a parent, you're undoubtedly the most popular person in your home. You're the one who makes everything work, takes care of the kids, and is always there for a hug. But that doesn't mean you're immune to the occasional put-down. Kids are never really happy about change, and they'll test you to see how much you've changed. Don't be afraid to let them know that you haven't changed a bit, and that you'll always be there for them.  2. Family is the most important thing.  As a parent, your relationship with your family is the most important thing in your life. You may not always get along, but you'll always be there for each other. And that's something you can never take for granted.  3. You'll make mistakes.  As a parent, you're going to make mistakes. That's just part of being a human. And, like any other mistake, you'll need to learn from them. Don't be afraid to admit when you're wrong, and apologize if necessary. And most importantly, don't ever stop trying. You're doing the best you can.  4. You have to work hard.  This may come as a surprise to you but being a parent isn't easy. You have to dedicate your time to caring for your children, and it's not always easy. You have to be patient, and you have to be willing to put in a lot of hard work. But that's what makes parenting so rewarding.  5. You'll grow up too.  As a parent, you're going to experience a lot of life changes. You'll grow older, you'll learn new things, and you'll change. But that's okay. You're growing into your role, and that's a beautiful thing.']",

Joe Biden (D-DE) appeared on ""The Colbert Report"" last night and while there were plenty of laughs, some of the more surprising moments came when Biden opened up about his beliefs.  For one, Biden is surprisingly candid about how he views the presidency and how he approaches it: ""In broad terms, it's about getting things done. I think presidents should be evaluated by how many things they get done, not how many speeches they give.""  He's also remarkably frank about the limitations of the presidency: ""I've been in the Senate for 22 years, Colbert. I've been in the Biden administration for six years.

810,How outrage over Cecil killing misses the point,"['The killing of Cecil the lion by an American hunter has caused an outcry amongst many people. His death has been used as an example of how poaching is the cause of the decline of big game populations and has reignited the debate about hunting. However, the outrage over Cecil misses the point.  The reason why big game populations are declining is not because of poaching, but because of habitat loss and degradation. Poaching is a symptom, not the cause, of these problems. If we want to reverse the decline of big game populations, we need to address the underlying causes.    The outrage over Cecil's death misses the point. It seems people are more upset about the fact that he was killed than the manner in which he was killed.  The killing of Cecil the Lion has generated a great deal of outrage in the UK and elsewhere. This anger is warranted, but it may be missing the point.  The lion was killed by an American hunter, Walter Palmer, who paid $55,000 to kill the animal. The hunter was apparently trying to kill a male lion, but Cecil was a female. The killing has generated a great deal of criticism, both in the UK and abroad, because of the animal's status as a lion.  Palmer has since been fined $3,000 by Zimbabwe's national park authority and his hunting license has been suspended. He is also the subject of a criminal investigation.  The issue here is not the killing of Cecil, but the way the hunter killed Cecil. The lion was shot with an arrow from a HUNTING rifle, something that is not allowed in Zimbabwe. The killing of Cecil has raised questions about the validity of hunting permits in the country, and the way that Palmer was able to kill Cecil without proper authorization.  The outrage over Cecil's death may be misplaced, in that it is focusing on the wrong issue. The important question is how Palmer was able to kill Cecil without proper authorization, and how this could lead to illegal hunting in Zimbabwe.']",

In every presidential election since the 1970s, there have been more candidates than positions in the party. This is because there are many ways to get on the ballot. Some states have more than one position on the ballot, so a candidate can run for more than one office. Candidates can also get on the ballot by qualifying for the presidential nomination at a party convention.  There is no single answer to this question, as there are many different reasons why people might want to run for president. Some people may feel a sense of civic responsibility and want to put their experience and skills to use in running the country, while others may feel a personal calling to serve in this important role. Some people may see an opportunity to make a real difference in the country, while others may hope to become a household name and become a symbol of change.

The conflict has spawned multiple waves of refugees and has displaced more than 9 million people, according to the United Nations.  In light of the humanitarian emergency in Syria, countries around the world have been calling for a response.  The United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed on a resolution that would create a new body to oversee the ceasefire and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. The resolution also called for the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in Syria.  The international community has been debating how to respond to the crisis. Some argue that the UN should focus on diplomacy, while others say that the UN should provide humanitarian aid and military support.  After consideration, I believe that the world needs to provide military support to the Syrian people.  Military support can provide a sense of stability and security to the population, which will help to prevent further violence and genocide. This support should be provided in the form of air support, humanitarian assistance, and diplomatic isolation of the Syrian government.  The international community must be firm in its stance against the Assad regime and provide the people of Syria with the necessary humanitarian aid. The world must also work to create a stable and peaceful Syria that can provide a safe haven for the Syrian people and refugees.']",
814,Why can't America have high-speed trains?,"['High-speed trains require a lot of energy to run, and America doesn't have a lot of energy.  The United States lacks the infrastructure and technology to build and operate high-speed trains.  It is not technically possible to build high-speed trains in the United States due to the different types of terrain and weather conditions. Additionally, the country does not have the necessary infrastructure in place to support high-speed rail travel.  There are many reasons why high-speed trains might not be a good option for the United States. One reason is that the country does not have the same level of infrastructure that is necessary for a high-speed train system to function. Rail tracks need to be carefully laid out in order to avoid sharp turns and collisions, and the same types of tracks need to be used for both freight and passenger trains. Additionally, the country's dense population and large distances between major cities could make it difficult to build enough stations and infrastructure to support a high-speed train system.  The United States has a number of railroads that are capable of operating at high speeds, but no rail line has been constructed specifically for high-speed passenger travel. The Union Pacific Railroad, for example, has a line that can speed up to 160 mph, but it is used primarily for freight transport.']",

Others are choosing to live single lifestyles because they believe that marriage isn’t a good way to live.

820,Do You Use CBD Oils for Your Child?,"['There is limited research on CBD oils and children, so it is difficult to say whether or not CBD oils should be used for children. If your child is experiencing medical conditions that CBD oil may help relieve, it is best to speak with a doctor before using CBD oil.  There is some limited evidence to suggest that CBD oils may be effective for treating certain conditions in children. However, the benefits and risks of using CBD oils for children remain largely unknown, and it is therefore not recommended that children use them. There is evidence to suggest that CBD oils may be effective for treating conditions such as anxiety, stress, and chronic pain, but it is still unclear if they are safe and effective for long-term use. Until more research is conducted, it is advised that parents avoid using CBD oils for their children.  There is limited research into the use of CBD oils for children, so it is difficult to say definitively whether or not CBD oils are safe and effective for use in children. However, some parents are reportedly using CBD oils to treat their children's autism, epilepsy, and other conditions. If you are considering using CBD oils for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor first to make sure that they are safe and appropriate for use in your child.']",
821,Why Does My Kid Prefer My Partner?,"['There could be a few reasons why your kid prefers your partner over other people. Maybe your partner is more supportive and communicative than others, or they may be more experienced in dealing with your kid's behavioural issues. It's important to remember that not all kids like the same people, so don't feel like you need to adapt your relationship to match your kid's preference. If your partner isn't fulfilling these criteria, perhaps it's time to consider a new partner for your child.  It could be because your partner is attentive, caring, and has a good sense of humour.  There could be a number of reasons why your child prefers your partner. Maybe your partner is more consistent, reliable and supportive than any other adult in your child's life. Maybe your partner is more fun and engages your child in enjoyable activities. Or, maybe your partner is closer to your child than any other adult in their life. Whatever the reasons, it's Important to understand that this preference is nothing to be upset about or feel ashamed of. It's perfectly natural for children to gravitate towards people who make them feel comfortable and happy. If you and your partner are able to provide your child with the stability and support they need, they're likely to appreciate you for it.']",

President Donald Trump is trying to manage these crises and unite a divided nation on edge.  The latest controversy centers on the president’s response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead and many injured. Trump said that both sides were to blame for the violence and refused to unequivocally condemn white supremacists, which caused more outrage.  Trump is facing intense criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Some people are angry that he hasn’t spoken out more forcefully against racists, while others are concerned that he is giving the neo-Nazis a free pass.  Trump’s critics believe that he is hindering efforts to heal the nation’s wounds and divide it further. On the other hand, many people in the US are rallying around the president, given his attempts to confront the issue head on.  While Trump has been successful in some areas, such as his role in the economy and his negotiations with North Korea, he has been unsuccessful in unifying the nation on an issue as important as racism.

It's quite another to be young and know that the man who is supposed to be representing you isn't really listening.  That's one of the big problems with Vice President Biden, according to a new study by Harvard University's Institute of Politics.  The study found that while Biden is highly regarded by young voters, they don't have a lot of confidence that he understands their concerns.  Biden's biggest challenge is that he is too old to really connect with the millennial generation.  ""They don't think he's listening,"" says Ryan Williams, the study's lead author. ""And that's a big problem.""  Williams says that the biggest challenge for Biden is that he doesn't really have a contemporary message.  ""He's been in Washington for a long time, and a lot of the issues that young people care about haven't really been on his radar screen,"" Williams says.  Biden's age is likely a big part of the problem. The average age of a Biden supporter is 54, while the average age of a Trump supporter is just 38.  ""Millennials are of course more interested in the future and in looking to the next generation to solve the problems that we face,"" Williams says.

The meeting is expected to last for five days, and will be chaired by NAS President Thomas Young.  Washington, D.C.â¦ The future of American astronomy is on trial in Washington this week.  A coalition of professional astronomers, space advocates, and museum directors is urging the U.S. Congress to pass the bipartisan NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2018, which would provide stability for NASA and its astrophysics programs.  The bill, introduced by Reps. Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), provides robust funding for the astrophysics research and operations program at NASA and directs the agency to continue its important astrophysics missions.  The bill faces an uncertain future in the U.S. Congress, but it is important that it be supported if reform is to be achieved in the American astronomy community.  ""The future of astronomy in the United States depends on the passage of the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2018,"" said Alan Boss, president of the American Astronomical Society. ""NASA is the only institution capable of conducting the types of cutting-edge multidisciplinary research that are essential to our understanding of our universe.""

One of the biggest issues that politics deals with in the United States today is the idea of nationalism. The United States was one of the countries that played a major role in World War II, and as a result, Americans feel very patriotic towards their country. This patriotism has led to a lot of nationalism in the United States, and many people in the country feel like their nation is the best in the world.  This sense of nationalism has led to a lot of problems in the United States, particularly when it comes to international politics. The country's sense of nationalism has led to a lot of friction with other countries, and this friction has been a major factor in several major international conflicts.

836,Pentagon Asks to Reconsider Awarding Huge Cloud Contract to Amazon,"['by Murray Newlands  14 November 2017  The Pentagon is asking to reconsider awarding a huge cloud contract to Amazon, a move that may end up blocking the deal.  The contract, worth up to $10 billion over 10 years, would give Amazon a big chunk of the military’s cloud computing business.  It has been criticized by competitors as giving Amazon an unfair advantage.  The Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have asked the Defense Department to renegotiate the contract with Amazon.  If the Pentagon does not agree to renegotiate the contract, the chances of it being awarded to Amazon may be slim.  The Pentagon is requesting to reconsider awarding a $3.7 billion contract to Amazon to provide cloud hosting services to the military. The move comes after it was discovered that Amazon didn't have the necessary security measures in place to protect military data.  The contract, which was announced in September, would have given Amazon a four-year monopoly on supplying government cloud services. It was the latest in a string of massive government contracts that Amazon has won.  The Pentagon says that it needs to reassess its options after it was revealed that Amazon's cloud service did not have the necessary security measures in place to protect military data. The company had been awarded a $600 million contract to provide cloud hosting services to the CIA earlier this year, and it was also awarded a $600 million contract to provide cloud hosting services to the Department of Homeland Security last year.  The Pentagon's move to request to reconsider the Amazon contract comes amid a growing competition among companies to provide cloud hosting services to the government.

While the book industry has seen a decline in physical book sales over the past few years, the article points out that the industry is still worth around $30 billion and employs around 1 million people.  One challenge the book industry is facing is that people are increasingly reading books electronically instead of buying them.

June 16, 2019  Andrew Revkin  When the Trump administration decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in September, it was intentionally timed to coincide with the start of the 2020 federal election season.  But with the program set to expire in just a few months, the Trump administration is now scrambling to come up with a solution.  One possibility is to restart the program on a shorter timeline, but that would require Congress to pass a law to extend it.  Administration officials have also been considering a proposal to create a new, limited-time program that would provide a renewable two-year deportation relief for DACA recipients.  But those plans are in jeopardy, too, as hiccups in the Trump administration’s efforts to secure the support of lawmakers have provoked growing criticism from both the left and the right.  DACA has been vigorously opposed by the Trump administration and its allies in Congress, and the president has repeatedly called for its termination, calling it an “illegal” program that is responsible for the increase in gang violence.  But in the past two months, the Trump administration has come under fire for its handling of the program.  Last week, it was reported that the Trump administration had failed to submit a DACA proposal to Congress in a timely manner, and the delay has prompted Democratic lawmakers to question whether the administration is trying to sabotage the program.  On Monday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, accused the Trump administration of “manufacturing a crisis” in order to get Congress to act on DACA.  “The White House is exploiting these kids and their stories to try to make a political point,” she said.  The administration’s efforts to get congressional support for a DACA extension have been complicated by another thorny issue: President Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, in September.

Glover, I beg to state that the statements therein made are wholly untrue. I have known Dr. Glover for many years, and know that he is a thoroughly honorable man.  I am, sir, yours truly,  WM. R. JONES.  澳大利亚南澳大桥  The Sydney Opera House  November 1, 2002  CAN WE REALLY REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM?  By RANDY HORN  The United States has a justice system that is slow, expensive and unfair. Forty years after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, strides have been made in diversifying the country's judicial corps, but much more must be done.  Public confidence in the system is declining as growing numbers of people feel that the legal system is biased against them. In a recent Gallup poll, only 32 percent of Americans said they had a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in the U.S. legal system to provide fair outcomes for all people, down from 50 percent in the 1970s.  To make the justice system work better, the Bush administration has set out to change it. Attorney General John Ashcroft has urged judges to be more “ rule-based” and less “ caseload-driven.” The Justice Department is financing a new program to train law enforcement officers in ways that will reduce the number of shootings, and  the Pentagon is providing $2 million to start a program to help low-income defendants find good lawyers.  But some believe that these measures, while helpful, are not enough.  “It's not going to be a magic bullet,” said Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories. “ litigation, it can take years to sort out the details.”  The problem is that the justice system is designed to give defendants a fair trial by an impartial jury of their peers. But the complexities of modern life make it difficult for juries to understand complicated legal issues and to come to a fair verdict.  The process also can be expensive, because defendants often hire lawyers to represent them, and the court system can require them to pay for these services.

In addition, strong corporate performance in Europe helped to keep global stock prices buoyant.  What To Watch For?  On the negative side, there are concerns that the US economy may not be able to sustain its current pace of growth. This could lead to a pullback in the stock market, and investors should be aware of these risks before making any major decisions.']",

This range reflects the uncertainty around how sick people would become and how quickly the virus would spread. The most likely outcome is that 1,000-3,000 people would die from the virus, but the worst-case estimate is that up to 5,000 people could die.  There is no consensus on how many people will die from the U.S. coronavirus, but estimates range from a few hundred to tens of thousands. The worst-case estimate, made by the World Health Organization (WHO), is that up to 21,000 people could die from the virus.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has produced worst-case estimates of how many people might die from the coronavirus if it continues to spread rapidly. The CDC has also produced estimates of how many people might potentially be infected with the coronavirus, and how many might become sick with the virus.  CDC’s worst-case estimate is that as many as 21,000 people might die from the coronavirus in the United States, and as many as 94,000 people might become sick with the virus. CDC’s worst-case estimate includes deaths, cases, and people who become sick but do not die.

If the coronavirus pandemic reaches peak intensity, and 70% of people infected die from the virus, then 1,000 people would die from the coronavirus in the United States.  If 80% of people infected die from the virus, then 2,000 people would die from the coronavirus in the United States.  If 90% of people infected die from the virus, then 4,000 people would die from the coronavirus in the United States. in 2019  There is no known cure or vaccine for coronavirus, which means the number of deaths from the virus will vary depending on the severity of the outbreak. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that up to 34,000 people could die from coronavirus in 2019. If the virus spreads rapidly and kills a large number of individuals, this number could rise significantly.  Based on available data, CDC estimates that as many as 20,000 people could die from the coronavirus in the United States during the next year. This estimate is based on the assumption that all cases will progress to severe respiratory illness, which kills 10% of people who catch it. It is also based on the assumption that most people who catch the virus will not seek medical care.  CDC has also made worst-case estimates for other countries. These estimates are based on the same assumptions about the severity of the illness and the likelihood that people will seek medical care.  Worst-Case Estimates for Other Countries  Based on available data, WHO estimates that as many as 250,000 people could die from the coronavirus in the next year.

871,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['There’s no question that President Donald Trump has had a difficult few weeks in office. In the days since the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Trump has been roundly criticized for his handling of the situation.  The president has been noticeably absent from many public appearances, leaving instead to speak with sheriffs from various states about how to address the issue of gun violence.  Trump has also been embroiled in a public feud with the National Rifle Association. The group has come out in support of the president, but the president has repeatedly suggested that he would take measures to strengthen gun regulation.  Meanwhile, demonstrations throughout the country have steadily grown in size and intensity.  On Saturday, Feb. 18, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., to protest gun violence and call for stronger gun regulation. The event was officially recognized by the federal government as a “National Day of Action to Demand Action on Gun Violence.”  Given the events of the past few weeks, it’s not surprising that Trump has been struggling to unite a nation on edge. In fact, the president’s critics are likely right when they say that he’s not doing enough to address the issue.  It’s worth noting, however, that Trump is not the only one responsible for the current state of affairs. American lawmakers have been largely inactive on the issue of gun regulation, and the gun industry has done an effective job of lobbying against any measures that might limit their profits.  Ultimately, it will be up to Trump and American lawmakers to find a way to address the issue of gun violence.

In this interview, she talks about her experience covering Boko Haram and the female reporters who have been pivotal in countering the terrorist group's messaging.  What was your first encounter with Boko Haram?  I was in northeastern Nigeria in early 2009 when Boko Haram started attacking villages. At the time, I was covering the conflict for the BBC's Africa Today television programme.  What surprised you most about your experience covering Boko Haram?  The scale of the attacks and the devastating consequences they had. Tens of thousands of people were displaced and many lost their homes and livelihoods.  What do you think has been the key to defeating Boko Haram?  The key has been the sheer courage and determination of the women reporters who have been working in the region for many years. They have relentlessly pursued stories that would bring attention to Boko Haram's atrocities and put pressure on the government and international community to take action.  What was the most challenging story you covered as a female journalist in Boko Haram's shadow?  The story of a group of teenage girls who had been kidnapped by Boko Haram and were being held hostage in a remote area of northeastern Nigeria. The girls were being forced to convert to Islam and were being tortured and raped. It was a difficult story to report and we received death threats from Boko Haram members. But we continued to pursue the story, even when it put our lives in danger.  What do you think is the biggest difference between male reporters and female reporters in the Nigerian conflict zone?  I think the biggest difference is that men are often given easy access to Boko Haram members and their areas of operations. This makes it difficult for women to get the same level of access, which often makes it more difficult to get accurate and impartial information.  What advice would you give to female journalists who are interested in covering conflict zones?  The first step is to gain experience in covering conflict zones. Then, make sure you have the courage and determination to get the story – no matter what the risk. And be sure to have backup in case of emergencies.']",

It is important to note that these recommendations are based on the assumption that a standardized testing process can be developed. If this proves to be difficult, then other measures should be put in place to improve communication.  The New York Times article suggests that a standardized testing process can be achieved by using a three-tiered approach. Tier 1 would include testing done at the individual level, such as testing of patients who have been in close contact with a person who has the virus. Tier 2 testing would include testing done in hospitals and clinics, and would focus on close contacts of patients who have the virus. Tier 3 testing would include testing done in laboratories, and would include testing of patients who have had significant contact with the virus.  The article also suggests that a better communication system is needed in order to improve the testing process. This system would allow patients to know the results of their tests quickly and would provide information about the virus to health care providers.']",

To do this, public health officials may recommend measures such as avoiding close contact with people who are sick, using hand sanitizers and washing hands often, and preventing the spread of the virus through air conditioning and ventilation systems.  Another key measure is to identify people who are likely to be infected and monitor them closely. Officials may recommend that people who are likely to be infected stay home and avoid close contact with other people. If an infected person does go out, officials may recommend that they use a mask and gloves to prevent the spread of the virus.  If an outbreak is confirmed, public health officials may also recommend mass vaccination to prevent the spread of the virus.

If this happens, the virus will spread rapidly through human populations, causing mass casualties.  The virus is a severe respiratory illness that can cause severe respiratory illness, pneumonia, andeven death. In the most severe cases, the virus can lead to organ failure and even death.  There is no vaccine or treatment available for the coronavirus, and currently there is no cure for the virus. Therefore, any outbreak of the virus will cause significant global casualties.  The coronavirus is already causing significant casualties, and if it becomes a global pandemic, it will cause even more casualties. Therefore, it is important that global action is taken to prevent the virus from becoming a global pandemic.  The coronavirus is a serious and potentially deadly menace, but it’s not the end of the world.  A new study published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that a more severe form of the coronavirus could cause a major global outbreak.  The study found that a more severe form of the coronavirus, which is currently causing a major global outbreak, can cause up to 100,000 deaths. This would be much worse than the current situation, where only a few thousand people are dying from the virus.  If this more severe form of the coronavirus were to become widespread, it could easily cause a major global outbreak.

It's hard to imagine the terror and chaos that enveloped a community when a coronavirus like SARS or MERS arrives. With little understanding of the virus and no real way to prepare, residents are left scrambling as the disease spreads.  That's what happened in Saudi Arabia in April of 2013, when a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2013_1 quickly spread through the country. In just a few weeks, it had claimed the lives of over 40 people and infected more than 800.  As health officials scrambled to understand the virus and develop a response, the situation quickly became chaotic. Nurses who were in the early stages of the disease were allowed to leave the country, and international flights were cancelled. Hospitals were flooded with patients, and resources were exhausted.  In the early days of the outbreak, local media played a key role in spreading awareness of the disease and mobilizing community support. Newspapers printed special editions with information about the virus and how to prevent it, and radio stations aired alerts about safety precautions.  As the outbreak continued, however, it became clear that the government was unable to handle the situation on its own.

The coronavirus is a highly contagious virus that causes a respiratory illness, often leading to pneumonia. A global outbreak of the virus in 2014-2015 caused widespread concern, with many predicting disaster for the world's population.  However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has now announced that the world has successfully contained the virus, with no new cases reported in more than a year. This is due in part to the widespread cooperation of governments and the rapid deployment of resources, including vaccines and assisted relief.

891,Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It.,"['Economists and policy experts agree: We need to flatten the curve – that is, make sure that incomes grow more rapidly for the middle and lower-income groups than they do for the wealthiest ones. Trump and Fox are behind it.  The evidence is overwhelming. Countries that have fared better over the past few decades than the United States have done so by making sure that incomes grow more quickly for the middle and lower-income groups than for the wealthiest ones.  The UK, for example, has seen strong economic growth over the past few decades, even as the share of wealth held by the richest people in that country has been declining. In other words, while the wealthiest people have seen their income grow disproportionately, the income of the middle and lower-income groups has been growing more rapidly.  This approach has worked because it has helped to reduce inequality and to boost economic growth. In the United States, for example, income growth for the top 1 percent of earners has outpaced income growth for the rest of us for decades. Flattening the curve could help to reverse this trend and to improve the lives of all Americans.  The Trump administration and Fox News have been advocating for a policy called “flattening the curve,” which is a way of reducing the number of people who are unemployed and out of work. The policy idea is that we should reduce the number of people who are unemployed and out of work to below 6 percent.  The problem with this policy idea is that it is based on the false idea that there is a magic number that tells us everything we need to know about how many people are unemployed and out of work. It is also based on the false idea that we can force people out of the workforce by cutting their hours or wages.  The truth is that we need to do more to create jobs and to help people get back to work. We need to invest in education and training, and we need to create new jobs in sectors like renewable energy. We also need to make sure that our economy is fair, and that everyone has the same opportunities.  This is why we need to flatten the curve, and this is why Trump and Fox News are behind it.']",

If you're like most people, you chuck food scraps in the trash without even thinking about it. But if you're trying to get your kitchen clean and organized, food scraps could actually be a huge help.  Instead of tossing food scraps in the trash, try using them in your cooking. For example, toss a few scraps into your stir-fry for added flavor. Or add them to your favorite soup for extra nutrients.  And if you're someone who loves to cook, consider collecting food scraps from your meals and storing them in containers in your fridge or freezer. This way, you'll always have a pile of food scraps available when you need them.  Itâs tempting to just chuck any food scraps that come our way, but in fact, they could be vastly improving your dishes. When you cook with food scraps, you are breaking down the foodâs cell walls, which allows the nutrients in the food to be more easily assimilated by the body.

897,Fears Rise for World Leaders as Officials Test Positive for Virus,"['As officials in India and the United States test positive for the H1N1 virus, global leaders are now on edge about the pandemic. Many are concerned about its potential effect on global economies, security and human health.  While the global reaction to the SARS pandemic ebbs and flows, some world leaders are now facing the prospect of contracting the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced Wednesday that confirmations of the virus had reached 21 cases, with nine deaths. The confirmed cases include 10 people in the United Kingdom, three people in China, two people in Italy, one person in France, and one person in Taiwan.  While the WHO has said that SARS is not easily spread from person to person, the possibility that the virus could jump from animals to humans remains a concern. In previous pandemics, such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, a person's contact with an infected animal was enough to spark an outbreak.  Officials in the UK have been particularly aggressive in catching those who may have contracted the virus, arresting seven people and testing 60 others. The Chinese government has also been taking a similar approach, with officials in Beijing announcing that they have detained almost 2,000 people who may have been in contact with the infected.  Despite these measures, officials warn that the virus is still spreading rapidly and that even the most cautious leaders could become infected if they do not take precautions.']",
898,Worst-Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths,"['There is no guarantee that any particular number of U.S. coronavirus deaths will occur, but given the current situation, certain worst-case estimates can be made.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that as of September 25, as many as 18 people have died from the virus, eleven of whom were in the U.S. Eight of the deceased Americans were in Texas, and one victim was from Minnesota. The CDC has also estimated that as of September 25, there have been 508 cases of the virus in the U.S., of which 432 were confirmed and 128 were pending confirmation. This means that, on average, one person has died per day and one person has been infected with the virus since September 25.  If the trend of confirmed cases and deaths continues, it is estimated that as many as 1,000 people could die from the virus by the end of the year, and 10,000 people could be infected.  The table below provides a worst-case estimate for U.S. coronavirus deaths. These estimates are based on information from the research literature and expert opinion. The number of deaths ranges from a low of 12,000 to a high of about 150,000.

There is no agreed upon worst-case estimate for the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths. However, a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that as many as 12,000 people might die from the virus in 2019, with as many as 27,000 people potentially becoming infected. If mortality rates follow this trajectory, then the U.S. would surpass Spain as the country with the highest number of coronavirus fatalities.   The best-case estimate for U.S. coronavirus deaths is 4,000. The worst-case estimate is 60,000.  As of September 25, 2017, a total of 59 people have been infected and 23 have died due to the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a worst-case estimate of 10,000 deaths in the United States due to the coronavirus by the end of 2017. This is based on an assumption that 58% of people who become infected with the virus will die.  If the US Coronavirus outbreak continues at its current rate, it is estimated that by early 2019 over 1,000 people will have died from the virus.']",

""City officials have not yet decided whether to close schools.""  Governor Andrew Cuomo has called for the school system in New York City to be closed for a week while it tests for the coronavirus. Mounts  Public schools in New York City are shutting down for the day on Monday, September 17, because of a coronavirus pandemic that has been ravaging the United States.  At least 21 people have contracted the virus, which can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, and even death. As of September 15, nine people have died as a result of the pandemic.  Many parents in New York City are urging the city government to close the public school system so that their children can be safe.  “If the city doesn’t close the schools, I’m moving my kids out of the city,” said parent Devin Castillo.  The city has already closed four schools because of the pandemic, and officials are considering closing more.  “There are people in the city who are very concerned about this virus and want to do everything they can to protect their kids,” said New York City Education Commissioner Carmen Fariña.  The decision to close schools is difficult, because it means losing money for the city. But officials say it is more important to protect the students.  “This is not a political decision. This is not a financial decision. This is a decision about public safety,” Fariña said.  The city is trying to do what it can to improve the safety of the students. Officials are using closed schools as laboratories to study the effects of the virus on the population.  “We are using these schools as laboratories to see how the virus is spreading and to see how people are responding to the virus,” Fariña said.

Some view President Obama as having done an exemplary job in leading the nation during the pandemic, while others believe that his response has been insufficient.  The pandemic has had profound consequences for both the United States and the world. It has killed tens of thousands of people, caused enormous economic hardship, and disrupted many lives. It is clear that the President’s response has been insufficient.  The President deserves credit for establishing a national response HQ and for appointing a cabinet member, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, to lead the effort. However, the President has been slow to make key decisions, such as declaring a national emergency, and has not made enoughresources available to his cabinet.  It is also worth noting that the President’s approach has been shaped largely by domestic political considerations. The Administration has emphasized public-private partnerships, stressing thatbusinesses and individuals should take the lead in getting their communities back tonormal.

The Sisters are the first human cases of the virus outside of Saudi Arabia, where it has killed more than 10 people.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said both sisters had mild symptoms and showed no evidence of the more serious form of the virus that can cause pneumonia and even death.  The virus is highly contagious and spreads through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva and mucus.  The sisters, who are both in their 50s, were not identified and it is not yet known how they contracted the virus.  The CDC is monitoring several people who may have been in close contact with the sisters and is working to trace those contacts.

905,Efforts to Control Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme,"['A state of emergency has been declared in two U.S. states due to the coronavirus. The declaration comes as officials in both states worry that the number of people infected with the virus is increasing.  While the coronavirus is slowly losing ground in the U.S., efforts to control the virus could become even more extreme, experts say.  That’s because the virus is likely to mutate and become more deadly, which could cause a public health emergency, they say.  So far, only a handful of people have contracted the virus in the U.S., and all of them have recovered.  But the virus has caused a number of death in other parts of the world, and it’s not clear how well people will respond if it spreads in the U.S.  “If the virus mutates into a form that is more deadly for people, or if it spreads more easily, then we would see a public health emergency,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.  There are three basic ways that governments could try to control the virus, experts say.  One is to vaccinate people who may be at risk. So far, only a limited number of people have received the vaccine, and it’s not clear if it’s effective.  Another is to isolate people who may be infected and prevent them from spreading the virus to others.  But the most extreme measure would be to quarantine people who are infected, in order to prevent them from spreading the virus.  “We would have to consider a scenario in which we quarantined large numbers of people,” Adalja said.  There’s no sure way to prevent the virus from mutating, however.  “The virus is constantly evolving,” Adalja said.  So far, the only way to know whether someone is infected with the virus is to take a blood or saliva test.  But that could become more difficult in the future, as the virus spreads more easily through the air.  “The virus is airborne, so you can easily catch it from someone else,” Adalja said.  And if the virus mutates, it could become even harder to identify who is infected and who is not.  “If the virus mutates, it could easily evade the tests that we']",
906,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge  President Donald Trump has tried to converse with Americans across the political spectrum in the wake of the Parkland shooting, but he has made few tangible strides in unifying the nation. Trump’s inaction and reluctance to condemn white nationalism is further straining relationships with lawmakers from both parties, who have denounced his response to the shooting.  In the days following the shooting, Trump met with survivors of the shooting, some of whom were wearing “NRA” stickers. Following the meeting, Trump said, “What I did know is that he was a great friend of mine and a great supporter of the NRA and I was really grateful for that.”  However, this did not quell the criticism of Trump’s response. Democrats and some Republicans have accused Trump of not doing enough to address white nationalism, which has been espoused by some of the gunmen in the Parkland shooting and other high-profile incidents.  In a CNN interview on February 25, President Donald Trump said he would “look into” whether the U.S. should boycott the upcoming Olympics in South Korea. Days later, the White House announced that the President had decided not to participate in the summit with North Korea.  The President’s decision to not attend the summit comes after his advisers had warned him that he would be risking a nuclear war if he met with Kim Jong Un without first securing concessions from the North Korean leader. In a statement, Trump said that he canceled the summit because “the Rigorous Pre-Agreement Process was not taking place.”  The President has been criticized for his reluctance to publicly condemn white nationalism, which some lawmakers argue is a contributing factor to the rise in gun violence in the United States.']",
907,The President as Bystander: Trump Struggles to Unify a Nation on Edge,"['President Donald Trump is trying to unify the nation on edge following a series of deadly protests and shootings.  Since assuming the presidency, Donald Trump has faced criticism for his responses to national tragedies. In the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Trump argued for stricter gun control measures and for increased mental health screening. However, his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, has drawn widespread condemnation for his refusal to denounce white nationalists and his defense of Confederate monuments.  The president’s responses to tragedies have raised questions about his ability to unite a nation on edge. Trump often takes a unilateral approach to responding to tragedies, ignoring advice from aides and instead issuing controversial tweets. This type of leadership style can alienate Americans who support stronger gun control laws and want to see the president take a more unified stance against white supremacy.  This weakness in Trump’s leadership could have serious consequences. According to a study by The New York Times, public confidence in the president’s ability to Handle a Crisis plummeted after the Parkland shooting. If Trump continues to struggle to unite a nation on edge, his approval ratings could continue to decline, leaving him more vulnerable to political rivals.']",

914,The Women Who Defied Boko Haram,"['Boko Haram, a militant jihadist group, has been waging a bloody insurgency in northeastern Nigeria since 2009. The group has targeted Christians and other religious minorities, as well as security forces and civilian populations.  In March 2014, a group of female students took part in a peaceful protest against Boko Haram at the University of Maiduguri in northeastern Nigeria. The students were arrested and subsequently subjected to physical and psychological torture by the group. After more than two months in captivity, 13 of the women succeeded in escaping and reaching safety.  These brave women have since shared their stories of resilience and empowerment, working to raise awareness about the plight of their fellow Nigerian citizens and to spread the message of peace and tolerance.  There are countless stories of women who have defied Boko Haram and fought against the terrorist group. These women have risked their lives to protect their families and communities, and have shown incredible resilience in the face of adversity.  Here are four inspiring examples of women who have fought against Boko Haram.  1. Aisha Barmak  Aisha Barmak was just 14 years old when she was kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2013. She was held in captivity for six years, during which time she was repeatedly raped and forced to convert to Islam. Finally, Barmak was freed in August 2017 as part of a prisoner exchange agreement between Nigeria and the militants. After her release, Barmak said that she felt “like a conquering queen” and vowed to continue fighting against Boko Haram.  2. Sahar Doghmosh  Sahar Doghmosh is a prominent female refugee advocate in Iran who has been fighting against Boko Haram since the group launched its bloody rampage in her home country in 2009. Doghmosh has worked to provide humanitarian support to women and children who have been displaced by Boko Haram, and has also testified before Congress about the violence perpetrated by the militants.  3. Aisha Mohammed  Aisha Mohammed is one of the few female suicide bombers in Boko Haram’s history. Mohammed joined the group in 2014 and vowed to kill as many people as possible in her attacks. In March 2017, Mohammed and two other female bombers were captured by Nigerian security forces. Mohammed is currently awaiting trial for her involvement in the suicide bombing of a church in 2016, which killed at least 34 people.  4. Aisha Yari  Aisha Yari is a female farmer and bomb maker who has also fought against Boko Haram. Yari was one of the few women left in her village after Boko Haram attacked in December 2014. Yari has built and detonated bombs against the militants, and has also helped to protect her community from attacks by the group. In February 2018, Yari was awarded the prestigious Goldman Prize for her efforts to fight Boko Haram.']",

Umar, 43, has been arrested, escaped and been recaptured by Boko Haram several times, but she has never been broken.  Since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009, the group has kidnapped an estimated 11,000 people, most of whom are still unaccounted for, including nearly 1,000 women and girls.  Umar has devised a unique strategy to foil Boko Haram’s kidnap attempts. She closely monitors the group’s movements and communicates with the families of hostages to keep them updated on negotiations and ensure they are properly represented in possible ransom deals.  She also engages local and international human rights organizations to publicize the plight of her compatriots and keep pressure on the government to do more to stop the kidnappings.  Last year, Umar was given the Queen’s Award for Enterprise, which she accepted on behalf of her community. “Victory is ours,” she said, “and we will never give up.”  Umar’s tenacity and skills have helped her foil Boko Haram’s kidnapping attempts, but she knows that the fight is far from over.

917,Opinion | How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,"['There is still much uncertainty swirling over the coronavirus, which is affecting global health. Various organizations have put out guidelines for coronavirus testing, but they are not always reliable or up-to-date. In order to help clear up the confusion, we suggest seven steps to fixing the coronavirus testing mess in 7 days.  We all want to know what the best way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is and how we can best test for it. Unfortunately, much of the information is still murky. In the meantime, here are seven steps that could help us to fix the testing mess in 7 days.  By Raphael Satter   Today’s Opinion | Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days  The world is in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the pandemic is “severe and spreading rapidly.”  The reason for the severity of the pandemic is that coronaviruses are very dangerous viruses. They can cause severe respiratory illness in people of all ages, and in some cases, they can be fatal.  In response to the pandemic, many countries have started to test for coronaviruses. However, the testing process is not proceeding as smoothly as it could.  In this article, I will discuss seven steps that the world can take to fix the coronavirus testing mess in 7 days.  Step 1: Pool Resources  The first step is to pool resources. This means that countries should work together to share information and resources. This will help to speed up the testing process and ensure that all possible resources are being used.  Step 2: Establish a Coordinated Strategy  The second step is to establish a coordinated strategy. This means that countries should agree on the approach that they will take in testing for coronaviruses. This will help to ensure that the testing process is efficient and effective.  Step 3: Create a Centralized Database  The third step is to create a centralized database. This will allow countries to share information quickly and easily. This will also make it easier to track the progress of the pandemic.  Step 4: Coordinate Testing Activities  The fourth step is to coordinate testing activities. This means that countries should work together to ensure that all possible tests are being conducted. This will help to ensure that the testing process is efficient and effective.  Step 5: Clarify Protocols  The fifth step is to clarify protocols. This means that countries should agree on the specific steps that will be taken in testing for coronaviruses. This will help to ensure that the testing process is efficient and effective.  Step 6: Implement Standardized Testing Procedures  The sixth step is to implement standardized testing procedures.

918,With Coronavirus,"['There is no cure for coronavirus, which is why it’s important to be aware of the symptoms and to get vaccinated if you’re at risk. Early diagnosis and treatment of the illness is the key to survivability.  Common coronavirus symptoms include:  Fever  Sore throat  Cough  Runny nose  Diarrhea  In severe cases, people can develop pneumonia, which is a lung infection. Death can occur from severe coronavirus infection, but is relatively rare.  The coronavirus is a type of virus that can cause severe respiratory illness in humans. It is a member of the family of viruses that includes the common cold and flu. The coronavirus is known to cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, in children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. It is also a potential cause of severe disease in animals, including camels, horses, and pigs. The coronavirus is believed to be responsible for a number of outbreaks of severe respiratory illness in humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2002-2003. There is currently no cure or prevention for the coronavirus. myocarditis, the chest pain is usually worse with deep breathing and coughing  The chest pain is usually worse with deep breathing and coughing.']",
919,With Coronavirus,"[', what is the incubation period?  The incubation period is the time it takes for the Coronavirus to start causing symptoms. It ranges from a few days to a few weeks., the virus can cause serious respiratory illness in people of all ages.  The virus is spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus, from an infected person. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as doorknobs, door handles, or countertops. Infected people may also spread the virus to others through coughing and sneezing.  Symptoms of coronavirus infection include fever, cough, congestion, and chest pain. In some cases, the virus can lead to serious respiratory illness, including severe pneumonia, requiring hospitalization. Death from coronavirus is very rare, but can occur in severely ill patients., most people experience mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms may include:  muscle aches, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing.  In severe cases, Coronavirus can lead to pneumonia, which can cause serious health complications. infected pigs  There is a small but real risk of contracting coronavirus (the virus that causes SARS) from a pig. In the worst case scenario, coronavirus could cause a full-blown SARS-like outbreak in humans. However, the risk of this happening is very small, and it's not something that you need to worry about.  If you work with or come into contact with pigs, it's always best to take precautions to avoid getting infected with coronavirus. This means wearing a protective mask and gown whenever you are around pigs, and washing your hands carefully whenever you come into contact with them. If you do get infected with coronavirus, getting assistance from a doctor as soon as possible is key.']",
920,Opinion | How Much Worse the Coronavirus Could Get,"['20 Oct 2014  It's been less than two weeks since the first confirmed case of the coronavirus was diagnosed in the Middle East. At this point, the virus has killed more people than any other disease in recorded history.  There is no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, which is a highly contagious, respiratory illness. Even if people do not develop any symptoms, they can still carry the virus and give it to others.  The coronavirus is highly dangerous not just for those who contract it, but also for the people who are responsible for caring for them. The mortality rate from the virus is high, and there is no guarantee that people who are infected with it will recover.  In the short term, the coronavirus is expected to cause a sharp increase in the number of respiratory illnesses in the Middle East. In the long term, however, the virus could become much more widespread and dangerous, potentially causing unprecedented death tolls.  The coronavirus is still out there, and it is still evolving, which means that the virus could get much worse.  The coronavirus has been spreading rapidly through the Arabian Peninsula and southern and eastern Africa, causing severe respiratory illness in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the virus is ""potentially much worse"" and could cause a global pandemic.  At this point, there is no known cure or prevention for the coronavirus, which has a high mortality rate. There is currently no vaccine or treatment available, and the best way to prevent infection is to avoid close contact with people who are sick.  If the virus spreads beyond these regions and causes a global pandemic, it could cause a significant loss of life. The WHO has warned that the coronavirus could cause up to 90% of all deaths from a global pandemic, and that it could be ""much worse"" than the H1N1 pandemic of 2009-2010.  If the coronavirus does become a global pandemic, it will be difficult to control. Many people who are infected with the virus will not show any signs or symptoms, which means that the virus could spread rapidly through populations. Hospitals and other medical facilities could become overwhelmed with patients who are infected with the virus, and it will be difficult to find enough nurses and doctors to treat them.  If the coronavirus does become a global pandemic, it will be important for people to take precautions to avoid getting infected. People who are affected by the virus should stay home from work or school, and should avoid close contact with people who are sick. People who are infected should also receive antibiotics to prevent the virus from developing into a more serious infection.']",
921,Opinion | The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus,"['The Government Has Failed on Coronavirus  The Government has failed on coronavirus. The number of people infected with the virus continues to increase, and the Government has not made sufficient progress in uncovering the cause, or developing a vaccine or treatment.  It is now two months since the coronavirus was first identified in the Middle East. In that time, there have been no confirmed cases in the UK. However, this is not the only problem. The Government has failed to take any effective action to prevent the spread of the virus.  The Government’s response has been criticised for being inadequate. For example, they have only issued a travel warning for the Middle East, and have not made any public announcements about the need to use preventative measures such as washing hands.  This lack of action is worrying. If the virus does spread to the UK, it will be difficult to prevent it from becoming a major public health issue. The Government should take more effective action to prevent the virus from spreading, including public announcements about the need to use preventative measures.  The government has failed to make a significant impact on the spread of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the U.K. has continued to rise, and the government has not yet developed a strategy to address theissue. The government has also been slow to respond to public concerns about the safety of the public.']",
922,Opinion | Itâs a MAGA Microbe Meltdown,"['We all know the story by now. After Donald Trump won the election, some of his supporters started believing that anything is possible, and anything goes. This included the idea that the election was a “rigged” campaign and that Trump is a “genius.”  Now, as we all know, this has completely backfired on Trump and his supporters. The “rigged” accusation has been debunked, and Trump’s approval ratings have plummeted as a result.  But the real disaster is the rampant thinking among Trump’s supporters that anything goes, including the idea that Trump is a “genius.”  This mentality has led to a MAGA Microbe Meltdown, in which conservatives and other Trump supporters are starting to criticize Trump’s policies and statements even more harshly than usual.  This is not only causing Trump’s approval ratings to decline even further, but also emboldening his critics and leading to a wave of criticism of Trump’s policies from the entire political spectrum.  This MAGA Microbe Meltdown is completely unnecessary, and it’s causing a lot of damage to Trump and his supporters. We need to stop it before it becomes irreversible.  It's a MAGA Microbe Meltdown  The best way to describe the current state of the U.S. government is a MAGA Microbe Meltdown.  The Trump administration is embroiled in multiple scandals, including the now infamous Russian collusion investigation. The president has attacked his own attorney general, threatened to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, insulted the judiciary, and insulted journalists and the intelligence community.  Meanwhile, the government is in total chaos. Top officials are resigning left and right, and there are reports of rampant infighting and chaos.  This is certainly not the norm for a successful government, and it is clearly having a negative impact on both the American people and the Trump administration itself.  The MAGA Microbe Meltdown is a dangerous situation that urgently needs to be corrected.']",
923,Opinion | Letâs Move Courts Online and Suspend Bail for Nonviolent Offenses,"['We need to move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses. This will help reduce the number of nonviolent offenders being incarcerated, which will in turn reduce crime rates.  The criminal justice system is broken, and it needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, many solutions require a change in policy or law, and those changes are often difficult to achieve. One potential solution is to move all criminal courts online. This would eliminate the need for people to go to court, and it would cut down on the amount of time and money that people spend in the criminal justice system.  Suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would also help to reduce the amount of time that people spend in the criminal justice system. Currently, people who are accused of nonviolent offenses are almost always granted bail. This means that they are released from jail while they await their trial, which can add a lot of pressure and stress to their lives. Suspending bail for nonviolent offenses would mean that people who are accused of these crimes would remain in jail until their trial, which would make them less likely to commit crimes and more likely to be treated fairly.  In recent years, courts have been moving towards online court filings, hearings, and judgments. This move is in line with the trend of more efficient and automated systems, which is good for defendants and the court system. However, there is one exception to this trend: bail.  As it stands, the bail process is an outdated and needlessly burdensome procedure that often unfairly punishes nonviolent offenders. Bail is a punishment that should only be used in cases of extreme danger to the community or the trial participant, not for minor offenses.  In light of this, it is important to move courts online and suspend bail for nonviolent offenses. This would reduce the number of people who are stuck in jail because they can't afford to pay bail, and it would improve the fairness and efficiency of the court system.']",

However, over time, M.B.S.'s work began to suffer. He was unable to meet the deadlines set by his superiors, and his campaigns failed to achieve the desired results.  Ultimately, M.B.S. was dismissed from his job. His declining performance was due in large part to the fact that he was not up to the challenge of his current position.']",

As the head of a global health nonprofit, my job is to stay up to date on the latest developments on the Ebola pandemic. For the first three months of the outbreak, our team was largely on standby, ready to respond to any new cases as they emerged.  But as the months passed, we started to see a lull in the number of new cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be over in May, but Preparedness and Response Teams (PATs) around the world continued to monitor for any new cases.  Then, on July 25, we learned of a new case in a remote area in Guinea. Our team immediately mobilized to help get that patient to a hospital with the best possible chance of survival.  During the outbreak, we fielded dozens of calls every day from emergency responders around the world, asking for our help. Now that the outbreak is over, it’s been amazing to hear from those same responders, thanking us for our help during the early stages of the pandemic.  We’re only just starting to learn the true impact of the Ebola virus. The truth is that we don’t yet know everything there is to know about this deadly virus.

927,Opinion | Theyâve Contained the Coronavirus. Hereâs How.,"['Last night the world breathed a collective sigh of relief after it was confirmed that the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,300 people in just over a year, has been contained.  The global response to the coronavirus has been admirable, with coordinated efforts by governments, the private sector, and the public sector all coming together to create a comprehensive strategy to stop its spread.  Collaborative efforts like this are essential to contain any type of infectious disease, and show the world that we are serious about stopping the spread of these dangerous viruses.  The key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus was the development of a vaccine. The vaccine was made possible through the efforts of scientists all around the world, and it was crucial that it was quickly deployed in order to protect people from the virus.  Without a vaccine, it would have been impossible to contain the virus, and we would have seen many more deaths from this deadly virus.  The global response to the coronavirus has been impressive, and we should be proud of the way we have responded.  View opinion | They've contained the coronavirus. Here's how.  As the coronavirus spreads around the world, public health officials and researchers are scrambling to find a cure or a way to prevent new infections. While no one has any clear answers yet, one important step in containing the virus is understanding how it spreads.  In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of Michigan found that the coronavirus spreads through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva and mucus. This is in line with the way the virus is typically spread, and it suggests that interventions to prevent respiratory tract infections should focus on preventing contact between people who are infected and those who are not.  This research is a significant step in understanding how the coronavirus is spreading and how to prevent new infections. It will help public health officials craft more effective prevention and treatment initiatives, and it will help us better understand how the virus is affecting people across the globe.']",
928,Opinion | We Need to Flatten the Curve. Trump and Fox Are Behind It.,"['When the Trump administration released its fiscal year 2019 budget proposal last month, one of the key proposals was the idea of flattening the U.S. income tax curve. The proposal would lower the top income tax bracket from 39.6% to 33% and the bottom income tax bracket from 10% to zero.  The theory behind this proposal is that by reducing the income tax rates, businesses and individuals will have more money to spend and create jobs.  There is a lot of evidence to support the idea that lower income tax rates are good for the economy. For example, when the top tax bracket was lowered from 70% to 39.6% in 1986, the economy grew by an estimated 8.5%.  The Trump administration is right to propose this measure. The U.S. tax system is already very progressive, and the top income tax rate is higher than in most other developed countries. It’s time to flatten the curve and make the U.S. tax system more competitive.  Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch are pushing for an immigration policy that would drastically reduce the number of people coming into the United States. This would have a negative impact on many working-class and low-income families, and would contradict Trump's previous promises to protect these groups.  The Trump administration is promoting a ""flatten the curve"" immigration policy that would reduce the number of people coming into the country by 50 percent. This policy would have a negative impact on many working-class and low-income families, and would contradict Trump's previous promises to protect these groups.  The ""flatten the curve"" approach would decrease the number of people coming into the United States by eliminating the diversity Visa lottery, increasing the number of required visas for family-based visas, and limiting the number of refugees admitted each year. This would have a particularly negative impact on low-income and working-class families, who are more likely to be dependent on immigration for their livelihood.  Trump and Murdoch are pushing for this extreme immigration policy because it is consistent with their own interests. Trump benefits from reducing the number of people coming into the United States, because it would make it more difficult for low-income and working-class families to find a way to live in the United States. Murdoch benefits from reducing the number of people coming into the United States, because it would make it more difficult for new competitors to enter the television and media markets.  We need to stand up to Trump and Murdoch and fight for an immigration policy that is progressive, inclusive, and fair. We need to continue to advocate for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who have been living in the United States for years, and for a policy that welcomes immigrants and refugees. We need to flatten the curve, and fight for a policy that benefits all of us.']",

Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, has sacked his defence and security chiefs, replacing them with dozens of his trusted aides.  The BBC’s Shingirai Chisoro says that the shake-up is part of a wider power struggle in the country.

Mr Mugabe also sacked the head of the security services and replaced him with his own protege.  In 1962, James Baldwin wrote an essay called “The Fire Next Time” that articulated the African American experience in the United States. Baldwin’s words have been read and quoted by many people over the years, and they remain as powerful and relevant today as they were when they were written.  In the essay, Baldwin speaks about the way that people of color are treated in the United States. He says that people of color are constantly faced with racism and discrimination, and that they are treated as less than human. Baldwin believes that people of color have the power to create change, and that they must stand up to the injustices that they face.  “The only way out is through,” Baldwin wrote. “Through understanding, through patience, through understanding and patience and through love. The only way out is through.”  Baldwin’s words are still relevant today, and they offer a powerful message of hope to people of color throughout the United States. His words remind us that we can fight for our rights and create change, and that we must never give up on our dreams.']",

Monthly Archive monthly archives  daily archives as a Tool for Sustainability  Businesses often turn to business data to help them make decisions and improve their performance. But data can also help organizations increase sustainability performance. By understanding how customers, employees, and the environment interact, businesses can make more informed decisions about resources used and emissions released.  For example, a business may want to understand how much energy it is using in an office building. By monitoring data such as power consumption, CO2 emissions, and even weather patterns, the business can make informed decisions about how to reduce its energy use.  Similarly, a business may want to understand how its employees are using resources. By tracking employee travel, environmental waste, and use of electronic devices, the business can identify areas where employees are wasting resources and making unnecessary emissions.  Businesses can also use data to determine which products and services are most sustainable. For example, a business may want to know whether a particular product is made with toxic materials or consumes a lot of water. By using data to make these kinds of comparisons, the business can make better choices about which products to sell and which to avoid.  In short, business data can be a powerful tool for sustainability. By understanding how customers, employees, and the environment interact, businesses can make informed decisions about resources used and emissions released.']",

977,Super Tuesday: Why didn't more young people vote?,"['There are many factors that contribute to why young people might not have voted in large numbers on Super Tuesday. Younger voters tend to lean Democratic, so there was a decreased turnout among young Republicans. Additionally, young people may have been more focused on school or work than voting, and many of the races on Super Tuesday were not particularly competitive.  When you're 18 years old, you're legally an adult and can vote in most elections. However, younger people aren't always diligent about voting. According to the Pew Research Center, about one-in-five 18-to-29 year olds voted in the 2016 presidential election, compared with three-quarters of those 65 and older. Another reason may be that younger people are more likely to be transient, so they may not have a permanent address or stay in one place for long periods of time.  Politicians and pundits have been debating whether young people played a role in this year's election. Various reports have cited high abstention rates from young voters as one possible reason.   The Pew Research Center found that among people ages 18 to 29, just 32% cast ballots in 2016, down from 39% in 2008 and 50% in 2004. A report from the Associated Press cited voter turnout among people under 30 as being lower than among those 30 and older in every election since 1992.  Some experts suggest that young people may have stayed home because they didn't feel like their voices were being heard. Political scientists have said that young people are more likely to vote when their generation is in the minority, and this year, the under-30 population was a minority, according to the Census Bureau.']",

Clinton won seven states – Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia – while Sanders took six – Minnesota, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona.  Clinton also won the backing of most of the major Democratic Party organisations, while Sanders has tended to outperform Clinton in caucuses and primaries.  Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) captured the majority of the delegates awarded on Super Tuesday, according to updated results from the Associated Press.  Biden took home 22 delegates, compared to Sanders' 19. Eleven delegates remain to be awarded, with four going to each candidate.  The AP also reported that Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) won three delegates on Super Tuesday, bringing his total to six.  Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders were the big winners on Super Tuesday, picking up more delegates than any other candidate.  Biden collected 106 delegates, Sanders got 81 and Ohio Gov. John Kasich nabbed just 6.  6:40 p.m.  The race is still too close to call, but according to the final results of the Democratic race, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are the top two candidates.

979,Elizabeth Warren: Where did it go wrong for her?,"['In the eyes of many, it appears that it went wrong for Elizabeth Warren when she attempted to claim to be of Native American heritage. Her attempts to use this heritage in order to gain an advantage in academia and a higher position in the political arena have been met with criticism and ridicule.  One of the main reasons that Elizabeth Warren has failed to gain much traction in her bid for the presidency is that she has come across as dogma-driven and unwilling to compromise. Additionally, her policies often lack specificity, making it difficult for her to articulate a clear vision for the country.  There is no single answer to this question as Warren's career could be seen in a number of ways as it went wrong.  Some believe that her aggressive stance on behalf of the middle class and her focus on economic reform lost her favor with some of the more conservative members of the Democratic Party, while others point to her unsuccessful run for the US Senate in 2012 as the beginning of the end for her political career.  Theory 1:  Some people feel that Senator Warren didn't capitalize on her early advantage in the Democratic Primary by pushing hard enough to secure endorsements from establishment candidates. This may have left her vulnerable to attacks from more conservative candidates who could portray her as a radical outsider.  Theory 2:  Senator Warren was criticized for her claims of Native American heritage. Some people feel that this made her seem unqualified to be a Senator, given that she lacked the relevant experience. It may also have damaged her credibility with key voting blocs.  Theory 3:  Senator Warren was attacked by Donald Trump during the campaign, and this may have hurt her standing with general election voters. Additionally, her attempts to brand herself as a populist candidate may not have resonated with some Americans.']",
980,Anthony Zurcher,"['Stanford economist.  Zurcher is a professor of business and economics at Stanford University. He is also a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. His research focuses on international trade, economics of innovation, and business strategy. He has written numerous articles and books on these topics.  The United States' accelerating withdrawal from the world stage is one of the most consequential developments of the Trump presidency. His withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and from the Trans-Pacific Partnership are just two examples of his hostility to international institutions and his disdain for the need for cooperation among countries.  Trump's support for Vladimir Putin and his reluctance to criticize Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election have only added to the perception that he is biased against America's closest allies.  The consequences of Trump's withdrawal from the world stage are likely to be significant.  First, the United States will become less influential in the world. The president's lack of interest in international cooperation and his willingness to disregard the opinions of other countries will make it harder for the United States to solve problems and achieve goals.  Second, the United States will lose credibility in the eyes of other countries. The perception that the United States is a unreliable partner will make it harder for other countries to trust America and work with it on joint projects.  Third, the United States will be less able to help other countries when they need it. If other countries are unwilling to cooperate with the United States, it will be harder for the United States to get them help when they need it.  Fourth, the United States will be more likely to be involved in conflict overseas. If other countries see the United States as unreliable and unhelpful, they are more likely to attack the United States or its allies.  Fifth, the United States will lose economic opportunities overseas. Countries that do business with the United States are more likely to be hostile to the United States if the United States withdraws from the world stage.   Sixth, the United States will have a harder time defending itself in times of conflict. If other countries see the United States as uncooperative and weak, they are more likely to attack the United States or its allies.  These are just some of the consequences of the United States' withdrawal from the world stage. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is just the beginning of a larger trend. If the United States continues to withdraw from the world stage, the consequences will be significant and long-lasting.']",
981,Super Tuesday: The winners and losers in Democratic race,"['The election of Clinton as the first female President of the United States and Sanders's success in pushing hard for progressive change in the Democratic Party has led to the widespread belief that the Democratic Party had become more progressive in recent years. Clinton's victory in superdelegates – those delegates who are not elected by primary or caucus voters – means that her tally of pledged delegates (the number of votes she has received from elected officials, party members, and other elected delegates) is greater than Sanders's, making it difficult for Sanders to catch up.  Sanders's sweeping victory in The New Hampshire primary on February 9 sent shockwaves throughout the Democratic Party and demonstrated the power of his grass-roots organizing. Sanders's strong showing in The Nevada caucus on February 18 continued his momentum and gave him a commanding lead in the race for pledged delegates. Clinton narrowly won the South Carolina primary on February 27, but Sanders's strong support among young people and African Americans gave him a much-needed victory.  Clinton has now won more pledged delegates than Sanders overall, but because he has significantly more superdelegates, Sanders still has a chance to win the nomination.  Hillary Clinton  Clinton won the Democratic primary race by a landslide, but this doesn't mean she automatically has the nomination locked up. Bernie Sanders has vowed to continue his campaign until the Democratic National Convention in July, and he could still win enough delegates to force a contested convention.  If Clinton does win the nomination, she'll have to face off against Donald Trump in the presidential election. Trump is likely to lose in a landslide if he faces off against Clinton, but he could still win if he manages to pick up a few key swing states.  Bernie Sanders']",

The UK has controls because it has a population of over 65 million people, which is greater than any other European country. The UK has a good surveillance system in place and has had more experience with coronavirus disease than any other European country.  The UK has a more modest coronavirus control program because it has a smaller population, a less developed healthcare system, and a more limited ability to mount a national response.  The UK has more modest controls because the coronavirus is more easily transmitted through contact with respiratory secretions than other viruses.

A coronavirus pandemic can be caused by any of a number of different viruses. The most commonly known coronavirus is the common cold, a virus that is spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus. Other coronaviruses can cause a variety of illnesses, including severe respiratory illness, meningitis, and a deadly form of pneumonia called SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). There is currently no vaccine or Treatment available to prevent coronavirus pandemics. (2016-present)  The coronavirus pandemic is a viral pandemic that started in the Middle East in 2012 and has since spread to other parts of the world. It is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, particularly in children, young adults, and the elderly. There is no vaccine or cure for the virus, and it is currently not known how to prevent its spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the pandemic a public health emergency.  As of June 2018, there have been more than 29,000 cases of the coronavirus worldwide, with over 11,000 deaths.

This means that the UK is likely to see a greater number of coronavirus cases.  2.

Supply of medical resources: Italy has a well-developed healthcare system, which may be able to provide the necessary resources to deal with the virus. The UK, on the other hand, may struggle to provide the same level of care.  Italy is a rich country, with strong economic and political institutions. The UK is not as rich, and its institutions are weaker.  Italy has a well-developed health care system. The UK does not.  Italy has a much larger population. The UK has fewer people.  1. Population size: The UK is around 80 million people larger than Italy, meaning that there is more room for variation in the way the two countries deal with coronavirus. 2. Healthcare system: The UK has a highly developed healthcare system, with a good mix of public and private providers, while Italy's healthcare system is more fragmented. This might make it easier for the UK to manage the outbreak. 3.

The main suspect virus is a severe strain of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), which first emerged in 2003 and is believed to have killed over 1300 people.  The report said that the main challenge facing the international community is to find a vaccine or treatment for the virus.  ""The Committee recommends maintaining the coordinated global response to the pandemic with a focus on identifying gaps and needs in order to improve protection for vulnerable people and further reduce the global impact of the pandemic,"" the report said.  Thursday 29 July 2014 - The coronavirus, which has caused a global outbreak of respiratory illness, is now concentrated in Europe, the World Health Organisation has said.  The WHO said that as of 6 July 2014, 62% of all cases had been reported from Europe, and that 22% of all cases had been fatal.  It said that although the number of cases is still growing, the trend is downward in Europe and the overall number of cases is now below 500,000 for the first time since the pandemic began.  The WHO said that there is still much to do to prevent further spread of the virus, and that it is vitally important for all countries to take the necessary measures to protect their population.  Most people who catch coronavirus are unwell within a week, with a high proportion of cases resulting in pneumonia.  There is no specific cure for coronavirus infection, and it is currently not known what preventative measures are most effective.']",

The 4-inch-long, 3-inch-wide egg was discovered in a mine in the U.K. in 2005, and its delicate, translucent tissue has allowed researchers to study the dinosaur in unprecedented detail. The eggs of baby hadrosaur were likely swallowed by a larger parent, preserving the specimen in the sticky resin.  A newly discovered tiny, sauropod-like dinosaur has been found trapped in amber and is the smallest known such specimen.  The size of the dinosaur still has not been determined, as the specimen is only about one-half inch long, but it is the smallest ever found preserved in amber.  Aminostegus  This is the smallest dinosaur found ‘trapped in amber’ and researchers are still trying to identify it.  A study that includes the world’s smallest dinosaur, a tissue-rich specimen of a species that roamed the earth over 160 million years ago, has revealed that the creature was trapped in amber.  The findings, published today in the journal Scientific Reports, suggest that the specimen, which is only about 2.5 cm long, was preserved shortly after death.  The finding may help to resolve a longstanding mystery about the smallest dinosaurs, which are only known from fragmentary remains.  The study was led by Dr. Dirk Schulze-Makuch of the Royal Ontario Museum and co-authored by Dr. Ryan S. Wood of the University of Alberta and Dr. Peter J. Makovicky of the University of Toronto.  ""We have a incredibly well-preserved, tiny specimen of a tiny, long-extinct dinosaur,"" said Dr. Schulze-Makuch.  ""This is the first time that such a specimen has been found, so we can finally resolve some of the longstanding questions about these creatures.""  The smallest dinosaur known from a complete fossil is only about 3.5 cm long.  The new specimen, known as Dromeus minutus, was found in the Carnian-age (Late Triassic) Amber Forest of southwestern Germany.  The study was able to determine that the fossil was from a juvenile dinosaur, based on the size of its bones.  The miniature dinosaur was also found to have suffered from ""severe desiccation,"" which likely happened after it died.  The study also found that the fossil had been embedded in a matrix of amber, which helped to preserve it.  ""We were thrilled to discover this exquisitely preserved, miniature dinosaur trapped inside of amber,"" said Dr. Wood.

Since October, the WHO said, European countries have reported more than 1,900 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with 219 confirmed deaths. By contrast, the agency said, countries in the Western Pacific region have reported more than 2,000 cases, with 48 confirmed deaths.  ""This is clearly a mass pandemic,"" Dr. Gregory Hartl, WHO's director for global health security, said in a statement. ""This underscores the importance of effective surveillance and response systems in the European Region.""  The WHO said that countries in the Western Pacific region, including China and India, are ""increasingly affected"" by the pandemic.  The coronavirus is a member of the family of viruses that includes SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and MERS-CoV, which is causing outbreaks of respiratory illness in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries.  The WHO said that the virus is ""spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus, from an infected person."" It is not known how the virus spreads from person to person.  The WHO said that most of the cases in Europe have been reported in people aged 15 to 34 years.

1022,Coronavirus: Why systemic problems leave the US at risk,"['There are a number of systemic problems that leave the US vulnerable to coronavirus outbreaks.  The US healthcare system is expensive and poorly-funded, so it is not able to detect and treat infections quickly enough.  The US has a weak infrastructure for managing and monitoring outbreaks, so it is not able to response quickly and effectively.  The US does not have a well-developed national system for tracking disease outbreaks, so it is not able to track the spread of the virus and make informed decisions about how to prevent outbreaks.  The United States has a systemic problem with coronavirus that leaves it at risk for a global pandemic, according to a report released Wednesday by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  One reason systemic problems allow coronavirus infections to persist in the US is that healthcare professionals often do not recognize the illness, leading to delayed treatment. The virus is spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus, from an infected person. Healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses, are at high risk for coronavirus infection because they are frequently in close contact with patients and are usually the first to identify an illness. Other high-risk groups include family members and close contacts of patients who are infected with the virus. People who are infected with the virus may experience coughing, shortness of breath, and fever. Symptoms typically peak within two to seven days after exposure and may last for up to two weeks. Deaths from coronavirus are rare, but can occur in people who are very sick or who have advanced respiratory illness.']",
1023,The mother and the murderer,"['There is no easy answer to this question. In some cases, the mother may have had a subconscious motive to kill her child because she felt she was not able to provide them with the care they needed. On the other hand, some mothers may kill their children out of hatred or rage. It is difficult to know the answer without knowing the specifics of the case.  The mother and the murderer is a 1949 novella by American author Raymond Chandler. The story is about a mother who is killed by her son and the psychological effects that this has on the son.  The novella is presented in the form of a letter written by the son to a psychiatrist. In the letter, the son explains how he became involved in the murder and how he feels about it. He also provides insights into his mother's personality and why he believe she would have chosen him to carry out the murder.  The son is a psychology student who lives with his mother and sister. He is very close to his mother, but he is also very insecure. He is unable to come to terms with the fact that he killed his mother and he is desperately looking for someone to blame. He believes that if he could find someone to blame, he could eventually get over his guilt.  The son's letter provides a unique and insightful perspective on the psychology of murder.']",

1037,Dr Anthony Fauci explains failure of testing in the US,"['Current medical tests are not perfect and often fail to detect some health problems. This causes people to miss important signs and symptoms of their illness and can lead to them getting sicker.  There are a number of reasons why medical tests might not be able to detect a problem. Some tests are designed to look for specific types of diseases, while others are not as accurate at detecting a wide range of diseases.  It is also difficult to know if a person has a specific health problem if they don’t show any symptoms. For example, some people have asthma but don’t experience any symptoms, so their asthma may not be detectable using the standard asthma tests.  The way that medical tests are designed also affects their accuracy. For example, tests that are designed to look for cancer might not be very accurate when it comes to detecting other types of diseases, like heart problems.  This is why it is important for doctors to do regular health checks and to use a mix of different types of tests to get a better understanding of a person’s health. This way, they are more likely to detect any problems early on and make sure that the person gets the treatment they need.']",

1047,How Europe deals with terror offenders when they are freed from jail,"['European countries have different policies towards releasing terror offenders from jail. Some countries, such as Austria, allow terror offenders to be released under strict conditions, such as wearing an electronic tag and undergoing regular monitoring. Other countries, such as Germany, allow the offenders to be released after serving their full prison sentence, provided they are considered to be low-risk.  European countries have different ways of dealing with terror offenders when they are freed from jail. Some countries, like Germany, heavily restrict the rights of terror offenders when they are freed from jail. Other countries, like the UK, allow terror offenders a greater degree of freedom after they have been freed from jail.  In Europe, terrorism offenders are typically released after serving a sentence, barring any special conditions set by the court or parole board. The release is often conditional, with the offender subject to conditions such as regular reporting to authorities and staying away from known terrorist targets. In some cases, the offender may have to abide by a curfew.  When an individual is released from prison after serving a sentence for a terrorist offence, the European Union member states must decide how to deal with them.   In most cases, the country where the individual was originally convicted will decide what to do with them. This can involve sending them back to prison, releasing them into the community with restrictions, or providing them with an alternative punishment, such as a period of unpaid work.   Some countries, such as France, have a special department specifically devoted to dealing with terrorist offenders after they have been released from prison. This department may provide support, such as finding them a job, or helping them to integrate into society.   EU member states are free to vary their policies and approach to dealing with terrorist offenders after they have been released from prison, as long as they comply with the European Union’s general principles on criminal justice. These principles include ensuring that offenders are given a fair and public trial, that they are given the opportunity to appeal their conviction, and that they are provided with an adequate level of social and psychological support.']",

But the new leader's reforms have not been limited to the political sphere.  Since taking office in April 2017, Abiy Ahmed has overseen a series of sweeping changes in Ethiopian society, including a relaxation of censorship laws and an end to a two-year state of emergency.  However, freedom of expression and assembly have not been immune to Abiy Ahmed's reform agenda. In early February, police in Addis Ababa used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who had gathered outside the Foreign Ministry to denounce the arrest of two prominent human rights activists.  'From freedom to repression under Abiy Ahmed' was produced by Onewa TV, a grassroots media organisation based in Addis Ababa.  Credit: Onewa TV  The once lively and thriving Ambo city in Ethiopia's Oromia region is now a shadow of its former self. On March 24, 2018, Ahmed Mohamed, the country's new Prime Minister, ushered in a new era of absolute political and social freedom in Ethiopia. However, in the months following his ascension to power, members of the Ambo community have spoken out about their fears of a return to repressive rule.  Ambo was once one of Ethiopia's most liberal and vibrant cities. It was here that the first free and open election in Ethiopia took place in 1990, and it was also the birthplace of Tewodros Gebremariam, the first president of the country.  Since Abiy Ahmed's ascent to power, however, Ambo has seen a dramatic change in its fortunes. The once bustling city has now become a wasteland, with many homes abandoned and the factories that once thrived closed down.  The residents of Ambo have spoken out about their fears of a return to repressive rule, saying that they no longer feel safe and free. In an interview with the BBC, one resident, Girma Weldu, said that she had never experienced anything like the situation in Ambo now.  ""There was a time when I could go out at any time of the day or night, but now I can't even leave my house at night. I'm scared all the time,"" she said.  Many residents of Ambo have also spoken about the increased police presence in the city, saying that they feel like they are living in a police state.  Despite these worrying signs, it is still unclear what the future holds for Ambo. Ahmed Mohamed has said that he is committed to ensuring that the city retains its cultural and social diversity, and that he plans to make Ambo a model city for the rest of Ethiopia.  However, until the situation in Ambo improves, the residents of the city will remain on edge, waiting for the next step in their long journey back to freedom.']",

In the past year, Guinea-Bissau has experienced power struggles between the military and the president, leading to the dissolution of parliament and the establishment of a transitional government. The government is also struggling to control the security forces, which have been implicated in human rights abuses. The Eurasia Group warns that ""as the political situation deteriorates, criminal gangs will see an opportunity to increase their trafficking operations.""  While Guinea-Bissau's political chaos might hold back the country's economic development, it could in turn fuel the cocaine trade.  Political chaos in Guinea-Bissau could lead to increased cocaine trafficking in the country, according to reports. Major political instability could provide a fertile environment for criminal organizations to smuggle cocaine into the country, which would then be distributed among local populations. This could result in an increase in drug-related crime and violence, which could threaten public safety and further undermine the country's already fragile economy.  The spread of political chaos in Guinea-Bissau could lead to an increase in cocaine trafficking, experts said Wednesday.  Fears are growing that the current political instability could lead to a power vacuum that would be exploited by criminal networks looking to traffic drugs.  ""There is a risk that with the current political instability, traffickers will move in and take advantage of the situation,"" said Khalil Chibane, a security analyst and member of the Guinea-Bissau opposition party APD.  Chibane said Guinea-Bissau had been a transit country for cocaine shipments moving from South America to Europe, but he was not sure if that was still the case.  Congo: Mapping trafficking routes  Human trafficking networks exploit armed conflict and instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo to smuggle people and goods, a new report released Wednesday warns.  ""This report contends that the current increase in trafficking and violence in the DRC is being fueled by illegal armed groups and their unpaid collaborators, as well as state forces that are not meeting their human rights, disarmament and demobilization obligations,"" the report said.

Here are examples of how Ellie and Nele might say the word she:  Ellie: She says  Nele: She says  Nele and Ellie:  From she to he, and back to she again!  This is a common mistake made when speakers switch between English for women and English for men. To make the switch, speakers will first use the word she for women and then use he for men. However, when they want to switch back to using she again, they will mistakenly use the word he again.  One way to change the order of words in a sentence is to use Ell and Nele. For example, ""She eats salad."" becomes ""Ell eats salad."" and ""He eats salad."" becomes ""Nele eats salad.""  When Ellie becomes Nele, she undergoes a complete transformation. At the beginning, she is a woman who behaves very stereotypically like a man. However, once she becomes Nele, she behaves in a completely opposite way, demonstrating that she is still completely feminine.  It's natural to switch between pronouns when talking to someone - it varies according to the person you are speaking to.  When speaking to Ellie, you might use she and when speaking to Nele, you might use he. However, once you have spoken to both Ellie and Nele, you might revert back to using she again.']",

They argue that these landscapes are sacred and have a deep spiritual importance to Muslims. Peatlands, they contend, are an important natural resource that must be conserved in order to preserve Islam and Indonesian culture and heritage.  The clerics also cite the countryâs Constitution, which enshrines the right of all Indonesian citizens to have access to clean water and agricultural land. They argue that restoring and protecting Indonesiaâs peatlands is a critical step in fulfilling this constitutional promise.  Finally, the clerics cite the Qur'an as evidence that restoration and protection of Indonesiaâs peatlands is of religious significance. They cite verses from the Qur'an that call for Muslims to care for the environment and promote sustainable practices. These verses, the clerics say, underscore the importance of conserving Indonesiaâs peatlands. fires  There is little scientific evidence to support the idea that peat fires are a sustainable way to produce energy, according to the International Panel on Climate Change. Burning peat can release large amounts of greenhouse gases, including methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  The majority of the clerics preaching for Indonesia’s peat fires are unaware of the scientific evidence behind the benefits of burning peat and the dangers of emissions, reported the Jakarta Globe.  “Some people in the government and the media may know that burning peat produces greenhouse gases, but they are not scientists and they cannot be experts on every issue,” said Habibie Abdussalam, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council.  The Indonesian Council of Ulema is a large body of Islamic clerics that advises the government.  Some clerics are advocating for the use of peat fires to help meet increasing energy demand in the country. However, others, including critics of the government, argue that the fires are an environmentally-unsound way to produce energy.  Peat is composed of partially decayed organic matter, and when it is burned, the heat releases large amounts of greenhouse gases, including methane.  The Indonesian government has been trying to find a way to reduce emissions from the country’s energy sector.

1060,The Plot Against Americaâs vision feels eerily familiar,"['.  Itâs 1933, and America is in the grip of a brutal and terrifying dictatorship. The new regime â led by a ruthless, power-hungry president â has control over everything, and the vast majority of the population is scared and intimidated. The only people who seem to be able to resist the government are a small group of daring activists, led by a charismatic and uncompromising leader.  The similarities between the plot of Novel and the events of the 1930s are clear. In both cases, the regime is oppressive and brutal, the leader of the resistance is charismatic and uncompromising, and the general population is terrified. In addition, the events of the plot against America are strikingly similar to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime in Germany.  The most obvious similarity is the fact that the plot against America is based on the novel, American Pastoral, by Philip Roth. Roth was born in 1933, just months before the plot against America was published, and the novel is a fictionalized version of the events of the 1930s.  Other parallels between the plot of Novel and the events of the 1930s include the fact that the plot against America is a political thriller, and that it explores the issues of fascism, anti-Semitism, and nativism.  Overall, the plot of Novel feels eerily familiar, and it contains a number of parallels to the events of the 1930s. It's possible that Roth was drawing on historical events when he wrote the novel, or that he was unconsciously borrowing from a historical event to create a compelling story.']",
