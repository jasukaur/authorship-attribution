3,my girlfriend was in an attempted rapehello i 22m am in a relationship with my girlfriend20f and im currently having a hard time figuring out what i can do my girlfriend is from a small town so its one of those situations where everyone is friends with everybody and so she has a friend group of about 10  15 people there was this one guy lets call him markfake name mark was a part of this friend group for a long long time until recently because of all sorts of stupid things he has done to multiple people from the friend group like living 3 months with a girl and not pay her rent and spent it on drugs etc recently my girlfriend opened up about mark shoving his dick inside of her mouth forcefully once and she told me that noone knows about this but me i took it with a grain of salt at first because it is a big accusation but throughout listening stories about mark from the rest of her friend group i can almost be assured that the rape attempt was true i have become good friends with her friens group so i usually get called to birthdays and such from her friends the problem begins here because one of the core friends from that group is good friends with mark still and obviously she doesnt know what he did so i cant be mad at her before i continue i just want to point out that ive never been the violent type  literally never been in a fight my whole life and i always avoid them because it is stupid but the urge i get of beating the shit out of him is something i literally never felt before i obviously communicated this feeling with my girlfriend and shes aware of it too because of this i didnt go to the birthday of my girlfriends friend and i feel bad because of this what should i do in this position,human
4,friendship advice needed  best friend is online most of the time yet takes days to respond to my messages im starting to doubt whether she really means it when she says im her closest friend and misses mewe havent seen each other in 2 years as we are at different universities she posts on her snapchat story regularly as well as posts on instagram almost every day but says that she is bad at responding to messages now as she gets so many shes become quite popular at her unibut what i dont understand is she literally told me that she doesnt like 90 of the people shes friends with and pretends to be friends with them to avoid drama in order and the very few she genuinely does like and isnt just faking a friendship with apparently shes still closer to me than those friendsyet she seems to be more active in texting them and replying to them within hours via posts and direct messages everyday she posts some of these conversations on her snap story so i see them than she is with my text conversations with heri just dont understand how she can text me stuff like i hugged my friend today who i havent seen in a long time and it reminded me of the way you hug cos you give the best hugs and it made me really upset and miss you lots because surely if she did miss me as much as she says she does then she would prioritise our text conversations compared to those with people she sees in person everyday so im really not sure why she says stuff like that when theres no evidence to prove she means itim pretty sure that if you were closer to someone and they were your best friend who you havent seen in 2 years you would make an effort to text them more regularly than friends you see in person and talk to every dayso am i right in doubting that she might not mean what she says to me and she probably doesnt consider me a best friend anymore and does actually like her uni friends more than me but obviously doesnt want me to know is she just using me as a backup friend or something in case her new friendships dont last forever,human

6,update on my parents stealing my medsthank you all for the advice my dad apologized for freaking out he explained that this mail thing is happening because its a habit theyve always just blindly opened the mail at the end of the day because any and all mail used to only be theirs they apparently still see me as a kid who doesnt get mail often he then proceeded to claim that he is still unsure if i should get my meds back because of the way i originally acted apparently he cant see that someone would push the issue after months and months of them politely asking not to invade their privacy i told him to look at it from literally anyone elses point of view if someone else was opening their mail you ask them to respect their privacy and they continue to open their mail anyways seems to me that anyone would push the issue more at that point but no apparently getting angry after a literal year of them not respecting my privacy is absolutely insane and i need to quit these meds that are supposedly making me go crazy i feel that i was actually too lenient i shouldve pushed back sooner well he had no valid rebuttal after i said that yet he is still debating giving my meds back i have yet to talk to my mom she is playing the silent game she will be the hardest to convince even if i have every valid argument laid out on a silver platter she will still come up with some bullshit excuse and turn it around on me we will see what happens tonight if she refuses to give my meds i am debating just straight up calling the police this is absolutely ridiculous and childish i am the crazy drug addict for simply asking them to respect my privacy fuck that i am an adult i have rights if they continue to open my mail and take my medication a literal controlled substance idk how the fuck they dont get it,human

10,feeling resentment towards a friend but still want to help them helpi have a friend lets call them frank ive known frank for years and our friendship has gone through its natural rhythm like most friendships go weve been really close for a few years then taper off then find each other again frank and i are part of a group chat with some other friends and for the past 6 months or so this is how weve stayed in contact no one on one interaction for the past few months frank has been responding to some of the memes that i send to the group chat with some snarky comments about me and playing them off as a joke we usually joke around by teasing each other but some of these snarky comments have been oddly specific a few months ago frank needed some help with their resume and help with buying some concert tickets i gladly helped out as no one else in the group chat seemed to want to help him not to throw it in franks face but ive constantly helped him numerous times and have done countless favors and have never asked for anything in return frank is currently struggling to find a job as he studied in a very specific field this will come into play later frank reluctantly took my help and was a little unappreciative but whatever maybe he was having a bad day fast forward a few months and its my birthday all my friends are wishing me a happy birthday but i never get a message from frank i ended hanging out with some other friends who are in the group chat and i just told them that i was sad that frank didnt wish me a happy birthday and i felt weird because of all of franks snarky comments the last few months one of those friends ben ended up telling me that frank was angry at me ben told me that frank is upset because ive had some big changes in my life i got a huge promotion at my job bought a new car and i just got back from a trip to japan frank had felt like every time i talked about my wins i was showing off and somehow rubbing everything in his face that was not my intention at all i felt pretty hurt hearing what ben said about 3 days later frank texted me happy birthday in a very monotone way im pretty sure the only reason frank texted me was because ben told them to because i was sad with a few months of hindsight im a little more upset than sad at this point first because frank got upset with me and didnt tell me anything second because even though they were upset they still asked and accepted favors from me third i guess im kind of upset that theyre upset to begin with i thought friends were supposed to be happy for each other not get mad when the other has wins in lifeanyway here is the ending through mutual friends i met someone named jordan who is in the exact field that frank is looking for a job in ive become really close friends with jordan and i feel confident that if i asked this jordan to help out frank they definitely would ive even asked about open positions and the hiring process and jordan told me that if i knew anyone with qualifications that he could get them a job at his company i want to introduce jordan and frank but im still feeling hurt and resentful from the whole saga described above and i wonder if its even worth it i dont know if it would be extremely petty of me to talk to frank and try to get him to muster out some sort of apology before helping him or if i shouldnt even help him at all if i am out of touch please call me out i want to know if im being ridiculous tldr friend is angry at me for life wins i now have the potential to help them out with a job search in a huge way but i feel like i need an apology first am i being petty,human

35,how to have casual sex without getting attachedive been sleeping with a coworker recently and im starting to get feelings and i really dont want to i know with 100 certainty he doesnt want a relationship i just got out of a four year relationship so im nowhere near ready to start things up again and even if i was i dont think he and i would be compatible for anything more then sex genuinely brain wise im not interested in him but emotionally im starting to like him for more then just sex that being said that relationship that just ended was horrible and over the past two years we had sex once im enjoying having really good sex and id like to be able to continue if possible and it feels safer to have a casual fling i know and trust vs one night stands or people from dating apps i think part of the problem is that maybe were being too comfortable like we get food together and hang out and acting to much like a couple should we stop cuddling after him spending the night how do i do this without getting attached,human
36,trying to hone in on just one of my 3 major vibes or labels or category in who i am as a person and im struggling any advicefirst of all i already do not like labels so that makes it hard in and of itself though a general rough draft is acceptable to me and figure out stuff along the way once i get a better sense want to focus on more of the mindfulness inner peace aspect and the guided meditations i do on buddhism and learning about that here are the 3 with examples1dark humor fucked up just bitter person honestly very cynical a debby downer whenever i show up to the party first thing i say is something like did you hear about that guy that killed all those kids last week just really had some shitty life experiences so walk around all pissed2 very passionate anti government pro equality and pro revolutionary ill fukn go to war in a guaranteed suicide mission for what i believe is right every one of the politicians is fucked and honestly i hope an asteroid just lands in congress and white house very anti religion and a dick about it 3 buddhism meditation mindfulness compassion empathy loving kindness impermanence balancing emotion being able to not agree with something or think it is wrong but also not be upset over it my therapist and i agree on the idea that they can coexist though in my mind i am 100 into every one passionately i go to rallys and protests and i spend a lot of my free time speaking at non profits and being an advocate for other issues and do stuff like volunteer for suicide helpline and stuff i am all about free thought as in subreddits about all those things i slightly differ on viewpoints it seems once an issue is brought up and a group that people use to define themselves as has a majority agreement on if its right or not it is cemented and everyone agrees and changes their viewpoints even sometimes just to fit the group so this is a wholeeeee thing i just want to focus on one group while being open minded and having original thought but get away from the two that are really hurtful for me and focus on the really great one whilst also being scared of becoming a generic member of a groupanyone who has had similar experiences or has some ideas of what i can do to improve my life with this thanks also you may not agree with one or more of viewpoints stated and that is okay please dont look at it with bias or anger just look at it as a scientific question type of way if the topics annoy you or whatever,human

67,i got catfished and i shouldve caught on earlier but now i wanna find out who ive actually been talking toso i just moved to this state and i started following people on instagram from around here and i stumbled upon a girl who i started texting immediately she answered and we continued talking i was suspicious at first because some of the earlier posts on the page were posted right after each other but they all looked legit and they had a lot of followers and actively posted on their story so i didnt further question it they would text all throughout the day and it didnt seem suspicious to me anymore eventually we exchanged pics and the ones she sent seemed so thought out and it hit me that she might have a secret only fans but just didnt promote it on her personal page after trying to look for it i came up with nothing this was all in the period of like 4 months and last week i realized that the person had blocked me i brushed it off but then i started to think back at the first suspicions i had and i went down a rabbit hole and eventually i found the real person who is a pretty popular only fans creator so now i am even more curious as to who i have been talking to the last 4 months,human

69,i got a job offer with a 40k increase and i dont know if i should take itsome background i used to work for a company that required me to work abroad for 6 months a year i did this job for many years and after starting a family decided to find a job with more stability to be home with my family daily eventually landed a job 6 months ago what they are paying me now is large decrease from what i made prior but were still comfortable after making some budgeting changes i am definitely at the bottom of the totem pole here overall its a really great company they treat their employees well and have some really good benefits i have a lot of potential here and there is a lot of upward growth i enjoy my colleagues and seem to have a good relationship with many of the senior members at the company many of whom who have voiced i have a bright future hereon to where i need advice i got a cold call 2 days ago from my former employer offering me a senior manager position in a more stable position where i could telework it would give me managerial experience that i know i need on my resume it comes with a 40k pay increase with bonuses i left the company on good terms and had a conversation last night with the guy who is leaving the position hes a friend from college luckily he was happy in his job but wanted to go somewhere with more upward mobility the gist is that the company is changing a lot of things and from friends that i used to work with have stories about how they arnt treating some employees as well as they used to this job wouldnt come with as many benefits and is a much smaller company so theres really very small room for upward momentum having this type of managerial experience would look really good on a resume and could help me transfer to another company after a few yearsoverall it would take many years for the company i am at to reach the salary i was just offered however i had friends and former colleagues help get me the position im in now so it would be burning some bridges unfortunately i also am very happy with where i am at but the opportunity is proving hard to pass up between telework and the pay increase even if just for a few years since i am so new at the company i dont foresee showing them this opportunity to be beneficial to me in any way regardless of the fact that i was not searching for another position elsewhere i would hate to bring it up and lose both opportunities i would love some outside options on this im giving myself a few days to mull it over before i decide any opinions or advice is welcome,human

103,not sure i did the right thing after argument with friendmy friend is like a sister to me and we have been in each others lives for years unfortunately she has been spiraling over the last year and its been difficult to know how to help its been extremely emotionally taxing as there is a new crisis every other day she recently found out she is pregnant and its at a pretty bad time in her life she was upset with how i responded which was to say that i am sad for her and also upset at her since this pregnancy seemed to be intentional wont get into why but she hasnt denied this and knowingly bringing a baby into a bad situation seems unfair i know lots of single parents in bad circumstances raise great kids but due to my own situation growing up with a mom with mental health issues its really hard for me to be excited for her and supportive when she cannot provide for a baby financially emotionally or otherwise its probably worth mentioning that im a new mom as well she said its best we dont talk in a passive aggressive way and im honoring that i left our group chats i unfriended and blocked her on social and am generally just planning to leave it alone there were a lot of other reasons this friendship wasnt healthy and it has been pretty one sided as of late this friend doesnt seem to care whats going on with others doesnt even ask and in general her problems take center stage i know my response was emotional and less than perfect but i dont know what else i could have done is it best to just move forward with no contact we do have mutual friends and so its unlikely we will avoid each other forever,human

119,financial stability and emotional intimacymy wife and i have been married for 11 years we were both raised in a very religious community with very strong ideas about marriage and divorce we married very young as is the custom early 20s we both exited the religion some 8 years ago and recently 2 years moved to a state far from our religious families it has been very freeing we have two young children when we got married we had nothing we had zero dollars in our bank account we have worked extremely hard to improve our economic situation and have done so without either of our familys help we know what it is to not have enough money to fill a cars gas tank all the way up and to rely on government assistance im now very fortunate to earn more money than i had ever let myself imagine possible and on top of that my salary has effectively tripled in the past 2 years money is no longer a real concern my wife is a stayathome mom and we have created a small business for her that is more of a hobby than a money making endeavor its something that she loves doing and is good at but it would not be a way to sustain anything close to the lifestyle that we have nowas the financial stress has slowly been stripped away im finding that there are other concerns now coming to the forefront my wife and i have created a beautiful life but i dont feel like either of our emotional needs are being met there is no abuse or anger or violence in our home unlike the homes we both grew up in weve worked hard to cultivate a gentle home environment we absolutely adore our children our kids are the most amazing little creatures on the planet and we both love them more than everything else in the world combined we have a beautiful house and nice cars we have plenty of money and resources last year we took three international vacations and several family trips stateside for gods sake we have worked insanely hard and have been and continue to be ridiculously fortunate i am unspeakably grateful to the people who have helped and mentors us through very challenging situations we lack nothing but if i look sat it honestly im unhappy with our relationship i dont feel satisfied or fulfilled i dont feel heard or appreciated i feel that im the one who fixes problem and finds solutions and ends disagreements through brokering a compromise i dont know how to fix it or even if i want to fix it i know that i do not want to go back to the status quo this all sunk in and i entered a strong depression around 6 months ago ive recently been able to come out of it somewhat through a combination of medicine and therapy my wife also takes medication for depressionanxiety and has done so for years and she also attends weekly therapy sessions my wife and i began couples therapy as i entered the depression and we decided to put it on hold until i could get my own mental health to a stable place im now at that place but we havent started couples therapy again yet im not sure that i want to unless and until i feel like we have done the groundwork that it requires im not sure if i want to do the groundworkdivorce would be exceptionally challenging im also willing to sacrifice my happiness for the good of our children im not convinced that staying together is the best solution or example but i can imagine the trauma that a divorce would cause on these little people that we care about so much and dedicate our lives to splitting up our assets and completely rearranging our lives would be no easy task eitherim hoping to solicit advice on the following im concerned that my wife is dedicated to continuing our marriage not because its fulfilling her emotional needs but because she is scared of losing the financial stability that we have created i know that she isnt satisfied with the level of emotional intimacy neither am i as i look back honestly on our marriage i do t think i ever have been ive been singlemindedly concerned with creating the life for my family that ive always envisioned i feel worry that she will never let go or even seriously consider letting go of our financial stability even if it would be better for both of us and our children i wont move forward on a divorce unless my wife and i both agree that it is the best thing for us and our children i would never leave her in a tough financial situation not least because she is the mother of my children and i love her that love and work ethic has kept us together for years but i feel like im finally coming up for air and realizing that i would really like to be happier and feel appreciated instead of tolerated any advice is welcome i will post this on different subreddits to get the most insight possible please forgive any typos as im using a phone to write and the length has gotten slightly out of control thanks for reading,human

140,should i just accept a reduced incentive raise or push back on managementbackgroundmy company lost a very good employee last year to another opportunity with higher comp  my companys response to the remainder of the team was launching an incentive plan to bring up comp and be more competitive  however because of the metrics the incentive would be measured against it could not start being paid out until early 2023  projections for the incentive were calculated and communicated in mid2022 and was scheduled to be paid out over 6 months  after 6 months metrics would be recalculated and the payout adjusted for the following 6 months and so onissueearlier this week the first paycheck that included incentive was processed for half the expectedcommunicated amount for the entire team  with no communication coming down from leadership our direct supervisor is out of town multiple team members reached out to payroll to be given the news that rather than being paid out over 6 months it is being paid out over 12 months  this effectively cut the current payout by 50  metrics for the next payout will be calculated midway through 2023 and that payout will be spread over 12 months stacking on top of the current payout  that will bring the payout more in line with the estimates and expectations set in mid2022 but not until august of this yearnow i know my explanation may be a little convoluted but the rub is this  for the next 6 months the expected increase is half of what was promised and the team has to wait another 6 months before we receive the full amount  should i just be happy that i received a raise now and can expect another raise 6 months from now  or should i push back on management and point out the fact that the payout was changed with no communication or consideration for the team and that team morale after receiving raises is very low,human

169,why does the man im seeing take it personally when other people approach meive been dating this guy for a couple of months and i adore him but recently hes been acting very weird whenever other people compliment me or approach me in a romantic way if he hears from anyone that someone hit on me or has feelings for me even if someone else just compliments me he takes it really personally and gets angry at me and then he will turn it into an argument and start saying really manipulative things to try and make it seem like its a bad thing that other people desire me lastnight he stormed out of my apartment because he found out through a friend that a guy we are mutuals with approached me at a party that i was at a few nights ago nothing happened besides friendly chatter he got angry and started ranting when i told him he had no reason to worry or feel insecure he tried saying something along the lines of you wouldnt appreciate it if i talked to random girls at a party and i just shook it off and said that hes comparing apples and oranges because i wasnt the one who pursued the guy at the party so its not a fair comparison but he got angry anyways and shoved all his stuff into his backpack and abruptly left i adore him and have feelings for him but i also would rather not spend 2023 having to constantly argue with him about why its not my fault that other people desire me ive never given him a reason to feel this insecure and if im being honest its a huge turn off he usually ends up over apologizing when he doesnt get a big reaction out of me and ill just say its fine and we move on but its still tiring ive asked him why he gets like that and he just says he gets in his head idk how to feel anymore like i said i do have feelings for him and care about him but no amount of feelings is worth it to me to sacrifice my peace what do i do,human

176,strung along about a jobhelloive been working with my current company for about 17 years if those 17 only 2 have been at the corporate office while the rest were in stores for some context on this issue i have i was recently promoted about a year ago loved the job but in all honestly i didnt enjoy it as much as i thought i would so i spoke to my boss about applying for another position which he was receptive to when the right one came along about 3 months after that conversation i applied for a new role which would also be a promotion the second i showed interest in this role i was contacted by the supervisor of this role along with his boss both told me i was their dream candidate and that they couldnt have asked for a better option i also was told i dont even know why we are taking the time to interview you this role was made for you so great got super excited and felt this was going to be a good fit we discussed the job and how i would fit in to this new role and what my responsibilities would be along with who would be reporting to me so i apply for the role a couple weeks past and i get the interview scheduled with 4 different people but before the interview we have a meeting with the entire company at this meeting i was approached by one person who could potentially be reporting to me asking if i applied for this new role not sure how she found out because i literally told no one i didnt want to lie to her in case i potentially became her boss so i told her the truth what i later found out is that several of the interview panelist were bringing up that i applied to the team id be managing btw i should also note that i used to work for this team and i felt like i was 5050 on the staff who actually liked me to be totally honest i do not feel i was well liked by that group in general fast forward to the interview and during the interview i was asked about an incident at our all team meeting between me and this person discussing me applying for the role i do not feel it was an incident by any stretch but apparently it upset her that i was applying for this role please keep in mind i didnt tell anyone after interviewing i felt really weird that something was up the interviews went well other than that one interviewers question during the interview i was even told the other candidate was not qualified well fast forward to last week and i found out that i didnt get the role which is fine but i feel like i was either a lied to or b something happened when word got out i applied for this job and the team id work with argued against my application would love your opinion,human
177,28f stuck my life is stale what should i dohello alli have an issue thats been sitting for some time and i dont know how to deal with it so please dont hold backi feel like my life is not moving as if im stuck and all my investments had been perhaps a mistake due to lack of judgment or resolve please share your insighttwo aspects in particular come to mind the first is my mother and siblings the second is my boyfriendmy father was an alcoholic and hardcore drug user heroin cocain etc almost all his life and it was consuming him it made him violent to the point police was looking for him in the neighborhood went to jail a few times but got out because he had connections physically assaulted my mother and is just unstableeventually as it got out of hand my mother kicked him out because he was living at her place so he moved to his familys where his step daughters lived who he loves a lot we on the other hand were always neglected and he made it a point to always tell me that he married my mother out of pity although she was working and had her place when she met him he on the other hand was jobless and broke infact she had him get into reading she taught him so much and she helped him out of depressionbut he never mentions it and will never admit it he disowned me when i was born because he didnt want children even had his friend falsely testify in court that my mother slept around which later proved to be falsehes just a bad guy and i quickly grew up understanding that i shouldnt rely on him i was my mothers friend more than a daughter  and i made it my lifes mission to give her a better life i was the first in the family to hold an engineering degree and i made sure my siblings had college education too got on scholarships and i got them job offers to start as soon as they graduate and they got paid while studying too i made sure to give them allowances from my money while they were highschool students while i was still a college student too i paid house bills and brought groceries i thought surely theyd want to make a better life for all of us too my mother was working btw she had a car and a personal debt and other responsibilities so my aim was to help her with her debts she shielded my siblings better than me in some aspects she hid some facts as to not impact their psyche they never held responsibilities like i did tbhfast forward few years and me and my siblings turned out different they were comfortable with the easy life and wanted more i was still concerned with our and moms future they seemed unreliablelike one time my brother told me he prefers borrowing money from our mother because she doesnt ask for it back i told him im flexible that he could give it back whenever he had the money and he refused to take anything frommeanother time i had to pay before class registration opens at the same time my sister needed money urgently i lend her my card and insisted no more than a specific amount because i needed the rest she just spent everything in it we fought she cussed out and thats the usual with her no reasoning works no matter the situation she guilt trips ppl and wraps it around herself which i call her out on so she just cusses out later i found out she bought herself stocks with it which if it were me id never mess up someone elses whole semester for that let alone family i stood by her so much but tonoavailseveral moments like that exist but this is just a sample to understand how different our mental isfast forward a few years im working now my mom is retired she had multiple strokes last of which impacted the speech region shes more like a child not her strong self anymore and easily cries over anything my sister was having worst tantrums and my mother would side with her everytime due to guilt it got so bad everytime i step in id get shunned out to the point no one actively shares anything of whats going on in the house with me anymore things kept piling up until i gave my mom an ultimatum because i cant be shunned anymore ill stop taking care of everything and have my sister do it to which my sister promised she would nothing good came out of iti lost my purpose in life kinda and i just graduated and started working i didnt know what to do with my lifeat that point i got in a relationship the guy was 23 and i was 26 tbh from day 1 he seemed to me like a gold digger with my background i could tell and it came out during our first fight he literally told me i demand you pay me an allowance  per month in a text right after i wished him wellpretty disrespectful but as i had no friends and me being the me who points out other peoples bullshit i called him out on it and he straightened up this kept happening so many times and he changed to the better he took me more seriously his father passed away few years back and mother left as a child and hes living at his gramma hes the youngest of his siblingsalong the way he admitted his toxicity and i got over my paranoia doubtful self i even gained the confidence to say no i stopped feeling shamed of saying the words i love u i understood the point of starting a family i understood life doesnt have to be as grim as what i saw growing up that theres more to it he too changed a lot to the better and admitted similar understanding i was able to trust people we experienced so many new things together because i decided to explore life and was okay with paying most he paid too so he was taking stance which i appreciated i learned what a man is supposed to be from him as we bonded and interacted with many people because he was a social butterfly and i saw the better in people through his interactions and he saw the better in himself through me but we could never get married for complicated reasons mostly legal and social im grateful for him but conflicted because i wanna get married to him and have a normal life i tried imagining myself with other ppl but its difficult logically i know i should leave because this is not sustainable and i tried breaking up so many times but he comes back insisting and i see no harmbut i dont know maybe im too comfortable also the dynamic in this relationship is less of manwoman more like motherchild although i never wanted the mother role he sorta reinforced it whether its abandonment issues or what idk it didnt bother me but it also makes mefeellike what if im missing out on manwoman dynamic the same way i understood the meaning of family through my own explorations rather than my household i could be missing out on feeling like an actual woman rather than the role of a mother that somehow gets thrown whether i want it or notkeep in mind i was living like a stranger at home i got pets two stray cats and a lizard that made my small world more alivei got a car and i traveled with 25 years from the age of 26 27 and now im 28 turning 29 ive seen a better side to life ive learned to put on make up ive fixed my self up ive attended rave parties and understood the concept of good food good company and good fun it doesnt have to be crazy expensivewell with that time in those 3 years my mom was with my sister actively shunning meright now imo she look the worst ive seen her at few days ago i saw her crying telling me she doesnt deserve to live at the age of 65 shes scared shitless of my sister whos just 26 and just started working not to mention theres retirement money thats always gone again whenever i ask my mother gently about it or anything else odd to assess whats going on she herself hides things from me and i wish she spent it on herself but clearly not shes incapable of that like literally she needs someone to take care of her not to be taking care of a self centered 20 sth yo woman my brother was going to get involved with a bad bunch so i made ways for him to study abroad the few times hes back from his vacation didnt make a difference hes only focused on him too it seemsimo this situation is wrong on so many levels and i dont know what to do i got the chance to live life and i understand it is my mothers decision to side with her daughter i also understand that ever if i was trying to fill my fathers spot ill never be able to i thought a solution would be to save up money and buy my own house then move my mom in with me not just for her sake but my sake too a house is gonna guarantee my rights especially with my dad being who he is and my siblings being unpredictableill be able to protect my mother that way this will also protect me from a potentially bad husband just like her she simply kicked him out i should add her place is actually owned by the government so we dont know when we could get evicted to which well have to move at my dads  not a good scenario not hoping for it so i calculated it and to save up for down payment itll take me 3 years by that time hopefully recession would be over and interest would be low enough for me to get a house loan i hope my mom stays with us until then otherwise ill feel lost again perhapsi wanna continue school but that seems like a privilege as i need a house now to my safety and to save my mom wanna get a phd in sth at some pointplease advise with whatever you can i would highly appreciate it as i have no one to guide thank you,human

222,fear of sleepingso ive been having a specific problem ever since i got my first actual job for some context im the type of person who is rather fashionably late at most things i was also raised in a country where the people are known not to be very punctual however after i became 18 and i moved to a different country the cultural differences started to become more clear i lived for a good amount of time with a person who consistently drilled into my head that being late was not acceptable whatsoever from doctors appointments to other social stuff that was until i started working said person micromanaging me since they too worked there before they helped me get the jobso my work is fairly laid back i basically manage a museum it opens at 9am i always come around 902903am no later than that even if ive been chastised for it not by my boss i dont think that theres any problem with that time i would also like to point out i dont mind that person that much anymore since ive learned how to handle them and their controlling tendencies so id say theyre not much of a concern but rather an annoyance that just adds more fuel to an already existing firenow for my main issue ever since i started working i am afraid to fall asleep at night in case i dont wake up on time tomorrow its something i do subconsciously i get so tense whenever its time to lay down that i have to remind myself to relax and unclench my muscles its gotten to the point where i lay awake till 34am which of course the next day i have to wake up to go to work the first few days of the week i can manage sometimes i even break my sleep by having 4 hour long naps after work waking at around 2am do whatever i have to prepare for the next day and sleep again for another couple of hours it always gets worse by the end of the week where exhaustion catches up and thats where i actually find myself in the situation ive tried to avoid so much before ive messed up a lot of fridays for exactly that reason im too scared to take melatonin or xanax to help me sleep faster in fear that theyll just make me sleep even heavier i forgot to mention usually im a heavy sleeper however i think ive trained myself to change that on the weekends i sleep 15 hours to make up for the lack of rest i feel like a damn robot that functions with a battery instead of a human atp ive never had that problem with school before since i didnt care that much and there werent serious repercussions i just dont want to get fired for something stupid like that yet i still do it i know that everything would be easier if i simply just went to sleep earlier and i wouldnt have to worry about not waking up since i would be well rested but it seems impossible to me i also live alone so theres no one to share this concern with it has taken a severe toll not only on my body but also my mind  and though i struggle with timelines but i believe ive worked here for at least 15 years now i just dont know what to do and i refuse to believe im alone in this i sometimes wish i didnt have to sleep at all just so i can always be alert and aware of my surroundings i set up at least 7 alarms on my phone ive tried calming music background noises reading yet nothing works its always in the back of my mind that whenever im asleep im vulnerable and not in control and that scares me whenever i try and fix it i always succeed for a few days then the cycle starts again if i were to describe it with a metaphor it would be like a snowball falling down the mountain and eventually getting bigger and bigger until it destroys everything in its path before coming to a stop and then repeat the weekends dont even feel good anymore as i find myself just doing absolutely nothing while i recoveri feel like i cannot escape it i think my priority is to find someone i can relate to since so far no one seems to understand it apologies for the novel i hope i was able to explain it properly i appreciate any and all advice  ,human

226,the replies you get for misogyny are always worse than what you saidi find that certain ideals can ruffle the feathers of female users and even some of the males that cape for them offending others is no less uncommon than accidentally pushing past someone in a busy hallway its going to happen what i find ironic is one may say something like  women these days just want men for their money sure some people may disagree sure that is a limited worldview but it is a sentiment nonetheless but then here comes the repliesyou sound like an incelyou are ugly thats why women only want money from youstop dk riding andrew tateokay maybe you should date men thenetc etcone would assume that such statements woukd be more damaging to op than ops opinion would be to the world so for sharing an opinion people make it their job to make sure you feel as low as possible and the the internet just allows it but the post itself nah thats offensive part,human
227,government flags have no good purpose in the current erarecently i have been into a flagdesigning kick and it has made me reflect on why we have flags at all i thought about how the original flags might have come about and their purpose i thought about what they represent and how they represent those things no matter how much i have thought about it i can think of no good reason why a person should be loyal to a flag that represents a city or state in the best cases you might fly a flag that represents your ideals there are lots of those they make some sense but even then it is the epitome of virtue signaling that is to say that flying such a flag does nothing to support that cause it simply associates you with that cause with almost zero effort or supportlastly flying a flag is loud it is screaming to the world that you are your association and it makes me not want to associate with you even if i like the cause or government but especially if i dont like the cause or governmentnow when i see people flying various flags i cannot help but think that they are people that i just dont want to be aroundpretty much the only thing i like about flags now is the challenge of creating an attractive flag that does a good job of representing a region or idea assuming a flag can even do that after i have created the flag i feel icky for having wasted my time in order for me to accept challenges to my view i must preemptively admit that i could be looking at this wrong and that if i am looking at this wrong it would be better for me to know be kind,human
228,it does not make sense to diagnose people with depressioncontroversial i know but hear me outfirst the wording of the title here is very deliberate we can argue whether depression as we know it is real but that is another issue entirely i am simply skeptical of the idea that depression is a diagnosable illness depression exists to the extent that some people are more inclined towards the emotions associated with depression there seems to be some dispute as to whether that it best characterised as sadness or emptiness or as its own emotion entirely but what we term this emotion is not relevant here i am simply acknowledging that some individuals are significantly more inclined towards these emotions than others and this is essentially what we seem to be diagnosing as depressionmy qualm here is that this could simply be interpreted as somebodys character personality or temperament why should it be assigned its own illness can any feature of somebodys temperament be diagnosed as a mental illness now because that seems to be the precedent that is being set by the mental health positive crowd especially as i am now seeing the phrase toxic positivity floating around it seems as though this is another way to malign those with a certain temperament though instead of melancholy it attacks optimism there are obviously mental illnesses where this is not a concern if you consistently hear voices in your head it would not be farfetched to find yourself diagnosed with schizophrenia but i fail to see how somebody being more likely to feel depressed at any given time is grounds for claiming they are ailedtheres also no metric with which we can quantify ones degree of sadness we can not claim that depression can be diagnosed when somebody consistently reads as a six on the sadometer therefore how can we be certain that somebody does indeed have depressionin fact it would seem to be in the interest of the psychiatric community to diagnose as many people as possible with depression to maximise profit whether or not you support capitalism you have to acknowledge that the medical industry must be approached a healthy skepticism for the more ill you are the more doctors profit psychiatry appears to be most prone to this as there are no external realities to compare the illness in question with for instance a physiologist can not convince you that you have a broken leg if you can walk painlessly however if the patient does not have this external reality for comparison how are they to know whether their degree of sadness is average they can be convinced that they are abnormally depressed without the means the dispute it and then sold therapy and drugsmost importantly diagnosing depression makes me fear what ideology we are perpetuating if we say that those who are more sad than others are mentally ill we are essentially promoting one singular way of thinking and perceiving the world and maligning those who do not through the guise of sympathy forgive me but i cannot support that ideaso i suppose those are my main qualms about diagnosing depression1 it is illogical to diagnose an element of somebodys temperament2 there is no way to quantify emotions and therefore no threshold in which depression can be diagnosed3 depression can be used by psychiatrists to scam money from the vulnerable4 diagnosing and treating depression promotes a sole world view and discourages diversity of thought,human
229,people shouldnt complain about not being welcomed or accepted in a country if they dont belong into the ethnic groupmy perspective is that if a country is mostly a homogenous raceethnicity there shouldnt be complaints about not being seen as one of them or treated the same way as they treat locals i mostly hear this about asian countries treating foreigners differently be it bad or good treatment the reason why i say these people shouldnt complain is because the same thing probably happens in there country so there is a level of hypocrisy asian students that transfer to america dont get treated the same as a white person born in america now this might sound like whataboutism which there is some level of but ill also answer why people shouldnt get mad at this with a different example that has nothing to do with race and culture if you were middle class you would often avoid or suck up to a rich person that just spawned in front of you since it is someone who lived a lifestyle you dont understand would a rich person be welcomed in a homeless shelter just loitering around having a good time,human

232,set point theory is real  once you get fat its more or less permanenti would very much like to get my view changed on this but havent really found a much debate regarding thisfor those who dont know setpoint theory basically says that once someone has gained a certain amount of weight that has been kept on for an extended period of time the body will not over the long term allow the body to stay at that weight this relates to metabolism etc although i dont really understand the biological aspect of iti dont think many here would doubt that theres some level of bounce back effect with weight and metabolism but the question is can that be overcomeanecdotally this has been my observation ive never met someone who was obese and developed into athletic or skinny shape for the long haul i think at the high ends it can work like sure maybe a 400 pound person can become a 300 pound person in the long haul or maybe someone can lose 20 pounds and keep it off but it seems nobody obese can become skinny i read one viral clickbait story of a bodybuilder who became obese and lost it as a challenge so he could relate to his patients but i dont think something like this would disprove it as he wasnt obese long enough for a setpoint to develop its certainly possible that its possible but just extremely difficult the same way 95 of businesses fail simply because its hard and not because theres some biological reason for it but ive yet to see any counterexamples does anyone have any even anecdotally,human

237,99 of all problems are created by your mindhi everyonei want to discuss the view that almost all problems are created by our minds i personally believe that our thoughts beliefs and perceptions play a huge role in shaping our experiences and interactions with the world around usthink about it  have you ever had a negative thought or belief about yourself or a situation which then caused you to feel anxious or stressed or maybe youve held a belief that wasnt based on reality or evidence which then led to poor decisionmaking or judgmentof course im not saying that all problems are entirely within our control or that were responsible for every negative situation we encounter there are external factors that can contribute to problems such as other peoples actions or unforeseen circumstanceshowever by recognizing how our minds can create problems we can work to change our mindset and approach challenges in a more productive and positive way for example if we find ourselves worrying about something in the past or fearing something in the future we can try to stay present in the moment and focus on what we can do right now to improve the situationso what do you all think do you agree or disagree with this view i welcome any challenges or differing opinions,human
238,lots of people today tend to follow the beliefs of their party strictly just to shut down the other party whether they truly believe in their party or noti see this more on the right but of course this can go both ways i believe that the majority of people today only shut down others beliefs strictly because the other person is from the opposing party for examplea conservative telling a liberal they are wrong when the liberal says the sky is blue but solely because the person is a liberal this can go to both parties but i just seem to see it happening more from the conservative side of things is this how everyone else feels or am i just crazy because right now it feels like some people agree with one thing their party says so they conclude they must agree with everything their party says as a result if anyone provides something that is reasonable then the person from that specific party will discredit the other for being the opposite party be honest is this a reasonable idea that im having or is this just nonsense,human
239,republicans are effectively banning many poor and middle class people from having sexfor many people who cannot afford to have childrenor simply dont want to have childrenit has become too risky to have sex some may take the risk of course but for many others such as myself i cant imagine having sex when it could totally ruin my life as well as the life of potential partners and future childrenalthough i am middle class and middle aged there is no way that i can afford childrenand ive never wanted children so i simply cant imagine sex being a viable option in my lifeit could be said that contraception is still available but its not 100 why take the risk when having children would mean raising them in a world where their parents cant afford to feed them and dont even want themanother objection might be that technically there is no ban true but thats why i said effectively banned the phrasing is intended to convey the point that the negative consequences have been raised so higheither go to jail or ruin your life with children you cant affordits simply unrealistic in actual practice for many of us to have sex as a viable option in lifecmv  ,human
240,bicuriousity and bisexuality r two entirely different things and should stop being combinedthis isnt to say im looking for someone to change my mind however i want opposition to see if i can see it from a different pov what i mean by they should stop being combined is that people should know the difference this tends to b an issue among women primarily and it needs to stop what i mean is you have im only sexually attracted to women ie the i would only fuck not date women people who will turn around and claim bisexuality and that is relatively harmful to actual bisexual people in my mind 1 bc thats outward fetishization 2 because u run into situations where a individual who claims bisexuality but is actually bicurious will tell someone who is homosexual or bisexual that they r bi and that puts the thought in their head that they r able to love and connect emotionally to their same gender so what happens when a bicurious person gets a bisexual or homosexual person to b interested in them and then they fuck and then theyre like whoa whoa i didnt mean that gay like cmon basically what im overall saying is if u r unable to develop a meaningful romantic connection to the same gender and you only see attraction to the same gender for sexual purposes you cannot claim bisexuality,human
241,adult heterosexual men should be offered assisted suicide if they want it regardless of their health statustechnology has changed society and dating culture especially within dating apps its shown that women are only willing to date a small subset of the most conventionally attractive men since women on dating apps receive hundreds of likes and matches per day meanwhile consequently the overwhelming majority of men dont receive any likes or matches at all women are guaranteed partnership and companionship because they are the traditionally pursued gender but men have no such guarantee in fact dating apps have made dating impossible for most mensimply put this massive underclass of heterosexual men have been completely cut out of the dating market mens lives in this generation are nothing but suffering and misery why is this a problem for wider societycompanionship is extremely important to humans as were social creatures also men are not able to mentally adjust to the idea that theyll spend their whole life alone without any chance of ever getting into a romantic relationship in my opinion this is why the rates of male suicide and diagnosed depression have skyrocketed in recent yearsthe stage has hopefully been set for my reasoning the overwhelming majority of heterosexual men have nothing to live for and no reason to be happy or optimistic about anything why force men to suffer death is the only remaining solution for the epidemic of male depression caused by the invention of dating apps and consequent change in dating culture and its cruel to force men to suffer,human
242,it is rude to expect others to wait to eat their hot food if you havent been served yetthis only applies to hot meals if its a salad or other cold item i think waiting is appropriate but if person a orders something hot and person b doesnt have their order yet it is rude to expect person a to wait while their food is getting cold then person b is eating fresh hot food while person as meal is not as good as it would have been i think waiting a minute or so is fine but if its apparent the meal was forgotten or going to take a long time this applies even though i have been in this position as person a i still wait because it feels taboo but i think its a stupid cultural expectation if i am the one waiting to eat i always insist everyone around me eats and i think that should be the norm i am not so important that everyone around me should have subpar food its not like im on the brink of starvation i truly dont get why this has become expected,human
243,filming  streaming in gyms should be bannedall different kinds of people use gyms right  there are professional body builders there are people who genuinely enjoy workouts but arent there to try to bulk up  slim down and of course there are people who really dont want to be there but know that they need to do something to get healthier  the last group among whose ranks i used to count myself are often extremely self conscious about just about every aspect of being there  not lifting heavy enough weights  not running fast enough on the treadmill  not looking as good in my crappy sweatpants and stained baggy tshirt compared to people wearing over 100 worth of athleticwear  and then you have people who think that the gym is their personal fitness tv studio  if youre a streamer who doesnt care about other people in your shot then great  now my selfconscious ass is going on the internet for all to see  if youre a streamer who does care  way too much  about other people being in your shot then you may end up going off on someone for simply trying to use the gym and getting in your way when all theyre doing is trying to access the gym that they paid a membership formy view is simple gyms need to stop allowing this  obviously outbursts arent allowed and actively problematic people will usually be dealt with accordingly but why even let it get there in the first place  why allow recording in a room full of selfconscious sloppily dressed people  and lets look at it from one more angle what about the women who show up in workout gear that is barely more than a swimsuit because they know they get really hot during cardio and are just trying to stay cool enough to not completely hate their workout  maybe they dont want to be shown like that in the back of some guys gym videos either and become the target of some creeps online harassment ban filming in gyms  cmv,human

245,minorities can have prejudices yes and we must hold them responsible for thatin the case of minorities i mean women black people and lgbtqsthe worst type of people i see there when it comes to prejudice are what i call blm yes it is the acronym for black lives matter the problem with these people is that they use their own race gender or sexuality to defend themselves against criticism attacking others including other minorities colorism is the name for the prejudice of black people against other black people of different skin tone such as not considering a black person because their skin is a little lighter than yours or receiving rights which they dont have and the problem is that people just ignore or treat these people differently even when the case becomes criminal the fact that there is a femicide law but not a law to protect men from being killed because of their gender is a sign of that a man can kill a woman in selfdefense that hell take it in the ass while a woman can scream from the 4 winds that she killed a guy in the first case i heard the man himself 6 year old son because of his gender that she will only be condemned normallyand why do we only have blacks being considered as targets of prejudice im not saying that they are not while there are many other racial and ethnic minorities asians latinos roma etcim brazilian and im talking about things from my perspectivethe very case that i caught is a brazilian one in which a woman and his girlfriend killed their 6yearold son because of his gender in addition to the fact that as shown in a recording they asked the kid about his sexuality and he said he was straight  all this as revenge against the ex husband in real women killing their children as revenge against the husband is very common around here,human
246,people who label themselves as transgender are attentionseeking andor want to feel like they are a part of a minority grouphello all let me preface this by saying i know i am going to get ripped apart for this post but i am genuinely open to having my mind changed i come from the south and didnt meet my first openly lgbt person until i moved out of my tiny hick town at 19 i used to have weird prejudices and repulsions until i opened up to the world a bit more anyhow to get to my reasoning a few years ago while working at a warehouse i met my first trans individual we were the only two people within 20 feet of anyone else constantly working together 5 days a week8 hrs a day due to this we developed a good friendship added him on social media and it was kinda my woahthisisjustanotherperson moment due to the fact we shared a lot of the same interests the thing is they never told me or as far as i know anyone else they were trans they were just a man and that is what everyone considered him to be even if some small features still retained from their previous gender they dont have it on social media either fast forward a few years later i have a very openminded and patient lol girlfriend and she happens to be best friends with a person who is trans theyre a good person to be around very funny and laid back however they are very loud about the fact that they are trans she has it on their social media she brings it up in casual conversation now of course it shouldnt matter how anyone label themselves however what has been explained to me through my own research accounts of trans individuals on socials like reddit and my girlfriend is that correct me if im wrong they felt out of their body as their assigned gender and having to act in accordance with the gender roles they were assigned to was torturous so it is either transitioning or living life like they are lying to themselves which i 100 get and empathize withwhat i dont get is if it was so torturous to live life as that gender why would you advertise you used to be it and now arent why not just be firm in your stance i am a man i am a woman it feels like attentionseeking behavior to me and somewhat akin to me saying hi yes my name is x and i have a penis whats up whenever i hear the words or see someone label someone themselves as transgender i cant help to feel weirded out by the fact they are even saying it  so i am hoping maybe if i understand it more i can get rid of that feeling there must be something i am missing for something so glaringly obvious,human

249,i think the only reason there isnt as much blow back from men portrayingacting like women is because of transgenderismwhen it comes to actors portraying someone that doesnt match their actual weight or ethnicity there has been some issues simpsons family guy amp big mouth all had white actors who played non white characters and it was a problem and they switched it uptyler perry brendan fraserhttpswwwpopsugarcomentertainmentbrendanfraseroscars2023fatphobic49114114amp martin lawrence eddie murphy amp robin williams have caught flack for wearing fat suits when it comes to white actors playing non white characters there is a racist history in the us behind that some shows were performed that highlights stereotypesthere is a sexist past in several different cultures when it comes to women on stage they simply were not allowed no equality there no opportunities for the same position so if a racist past is enough to stop a white actor from playing a black character why not a male playing a femaleon fox when it comes to two shows that had an issue with a white person playing a non white character they have another show where men play 34 characters big mouth as well has a man playing a female character why is that not an issuei think because some men like to dress as women and or like to perform drag not much is said about those occurrences drag shows seem pretty similar to menstrail shows to me non women highlightingexaggerating stereotypical female behavior so what other reason is there for there to be more of an issue when it comes to weight and ethnicity vs sex,human
250,the age of consent should be 18 everywherein my opinion it should always be illegal for someone to have sex with a 13 yo or younger child unless both parties are 13 or less too from 14 to 15 teens should have the possibility to have sex with people who are max 19 yo as nineteen year olds are still teenagers and from 16 to 17 people should have the possibility to have sex with people who are max 25 yo as this is the age in which the brain is usually fully developed therefore if anyone who is 26 yo or older has sex with a minor 17 or less they should be punished for statutory rape in all cases both the sex and sexuality of the parties is irrelevant the punishment for each case should be lessened as the victim becomes older class aharshest punishment gt class cweakest punishment so if someone who is 14 or older has sex with someone under 14 they should face the harshest punishment class a nonetheless if the perpetrator is 1417 they should be less punished 14 to 15 with class c and 16 to 17 with class b now when someone who is 20 yo or older has sex with a someone who is 14 or 15 this should be classified as a class b crime lastly if someone 26 or older has sex with a 16 or 17 year old this should be classified as a class c crime now if the perpetrator is in a position of trust they should always be punished for a class a crime no matter how old the minor is and no matter the perpetrators age even if they are 23 under 26 and their victim is 17 the older party is a criminal now why 18 i know a 18 yo is still not mature enough to have sex with a 40 yo but we have to draw the line somewhere and i think the perfect age for this is 18 since at this age people become legal adults in most countries and acquire all the rights and responsibilities that come with this with this proposal more teenagers are protected from manipulation abuse stds and unwanted pregnancies besides they are given a fair amount of freedom and cases where there is a only a small age gap between teenagers are avoided,human

252,the covid 19 virus either escaped or was released intentionally from the lab in wuhanlets do some math boys and girls this lesson is on probability well to be accurate probability and lab leaks lets first assume that the covid 19 virus came from somewhereit did right well that somewhere was probably on the surface area of earth not a big stretch to assume this right earths land surface area 150000000 sq km since covid 19 didnt pop into existence in 15 different places at once we can say the odds of covid 19 appearing for the first time on any given sq kilometer of earths land surface is 1150000000 now the lab part the wuhan lab is a bsl4 if my research is correct there are approximately 59 of these labs in the world so the odds of any given kilometer of earths surface area having a bsl4 is 59150000000 or 12542372 so what are the odds of these unrelated events occurring the lab and the virus origins being in the same place thats easy math1150000000  2542372 or about 1 in 381355800000000 maybe this is over simplified  maybe my math is wrong but it seems to me the chinese have some explaining to do also the virus had a significant number of variants i didnt look this up and maybe some talented virologist can weigh in but it seems to me a naturally occurring virus would be more stable mother nature builds stability in with that survival of the fittest more advanced beings have proofreading mechanisms that ensure the stability im not sure if viruses have this ability but some frankeinvirus crisperd together seems like it would be more unstableonce again unqualified speculation change my view,human
253,hitler absolutely committed suicide in his berlin bunker on 4301945 and conspiracy theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunked however hitler couldve easily escaped berlin and lived out the rest of his life under a concealed identity if he wanted toas far as i am concerned both of the following statements are equally true1 hitler committed suicide in his berlin bunker on april 30th 1945 the official account of hitlers death is completely accurate and all conspiracy theories implying otherwise have been thoroughly debunked2 hitler could have easily escaped berlin and lived out his days without being caught if he had wanted toit seems to me that people who believe hitler escaped fundamentally misunderstand the man and his worldview there is no doubt in my mind that hitler did not wish to escape his ego was too large for him to live out his remaining days in anonymity like many of his nazi colleagues did for 12 years hitler possessed absolute power and enjoyed a luxurious life of fame and fortune hitler was far from the type of person who could just lie low and live shabbily for the rest of his life furthermore hitler was a darwinist who truly believed that historys losers deserved to die and that he if he lost deserved to die as well additionally teeth found in the bunker perfectly match hitlers dental records and there are several witnesses to hitlers suicide among other things there is no doubt that hitler committed suicide on april 30th 1945 and theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunkednevertheless many claim that even if he wanted to hitler could never escape to south america and live out the rest of his life undetected like many of his colleagues did but is this true while i initially believed this as well the more research ive done on this the more apparent it appears to me that hitler could have easily fled to south america if he so desiredfirst of all during the soviet invasion of berlin hans baur httpsenwikipediaorgwikihansbaurhttpsenwikipediaorgwikihansbaur hitlers personal pilot had a plane on standby ready to fly him out of germany of course he declined baurs offer and chose to commit suicide instead hanna reitsch httpsenwikipediaorgwikihannareitschhttpsenwikipediaorgwikihannareitsch another nazi pilot who could have flown hitler out of germany flew into berlin on april 26 and returned on april 29 demonstrating that aircraft could fly into and out of berlin undetected during the soviet invasion of the city hitler had pilots who flew aircraft safely into and out of berlin during the invasion just waiting for him if he wanted to escape yet people believe it wouldve been impossible for him to successfully escapethroughout third reich territory there were literally massive tunnel networks constructed for the purpose of allowing nazis to escape in the event of a defeat several countries in south america and the middle east were eager to assist nazis in escaping justice by utilizing extensive ratlines networks there was a great deal of assistance provided by organizations such as oddessa and many members of the catholic church in helping nazis escapefurthermore the socalled nazi hunting of the allies was an absolute joke they didnt even try to bring many nazi war criminals to justice in fact they were all too eager to use their talents instead operation paperclip many nazi war criminals did not even try to conceal their identities and several allied governments received information regarding their whereabouts but did nothing with itan example of this is adolf eichmann one of the top men in nazi germany eichmann didnt even try to conceal his identity apart from changing his name to ricardo klement he did nothing to conceal his identity after fleeing to argentina he did not change his appearance whatsoever all of his family members kept the surname eichmann he literally flew from argentina to germany and back several times in the 1950s to meet with old friends and family and the german authorities did not even give a shit and his son would even casually brag to others about how his father is the adolf eichmann who heroically slaughtered jews during ww2 and although he made no effort whatsoever to conceal his identity it took 20 years for him to be brought to justicejosef mengele was also one of the most nefarious players in nazi germany did not make efforts to conceal his identity and was still never found in his lifetime his fate was only revealed after his deathif these men could evade justice without even trying to conceal their identities why couldnt hitler have done the same if he had actually tried to conceal his identity he literally had body doubles who looked very similar to him in order to prove that hitler killed himself the nazis could have sent the soviets the dead body of his body double while the actual hitler fled to argentina it would be impossible to determine his identity if he had just shaved his mustache off have you seen hitler without a mustache no one would ever be able to recognize him walking down the street because he looks completely unrecognizablehttpsiimgurcomgd9gzjpghttpsiimgurcomgd9gzjpghttps3bpblogspotcomktr2qvwfekwawxhdzbryiaaaaaaaalmks4qwc2iiogebhv2mubphabm1fpacu9hdqclcbs1600hitlerindisguisejpghttps3bpblogspotcomktr2qvwfekwawxhdzbryiaaaaaaaalmks4qwc2iiogebhv2mubphabm1fpacu9hdqclcbs1600hitlerindisguisejpgif you saw hitler walking down the street in regular clothing without a mustache i guarantee that you would not recognize him he looks like a completely generic 1950s british white guy without it httpsibbcozsyqm6yhttpsibbcozsyqm6yhe looks like a completely different person to be on the safe side he may have taken more drastic measures to alter his appearance such as shaving his head bald or dying his hair there is no doubt that hitler had the resources and connections necessary to obtain fake identification documentsok it is true that himmler did try to disguise himself and escape but was caught specifically himmler shaved his moustache replaced his glasses and wore an eyepatch however himmer was picked up by the allies not because they recognized him but because of his forged papers which identified him as belonging to the field police members who the allied mp had standing orders to detain they didnt even know they had him until he gave his real name to the allied commander of the holding camp if himmler hadnt stupidly disguised himself as a nazi field police officer but instead posed as a regular german civilian he probably would have never been caughtwithin fairly recent history  and in this mediasaturated modern world  we had a famous war criminal radovan karadic hiding right under everybodys noses for more than a decade simply by having grown a big bushy beard the man was living in belgrade the capital of serbia that is the same country where he was president and committed his crimes he was living under the noses of everybody in the very same capital he presided over unrecognized for a decade the world is a very very big place and even the cia would have never found bin laden if he had just decided to live in a village in turkmenistan for the rest of his life even with all our 247 surveillance tech and billions of dollars he instead lived in a massive house with dozens of people and was still actively and heavily involved with

254,the eu should extend membership to north africa and the fertile crescent if they can meet the necessary requirements to joinbasically what the title says for most of history europe as a concept has been defined by the roman empire various states tried to claim themselves to be successors of it and most states try to trace themselves back to it the same is true of the states of the levant mesopotamia and north africa yes they are mostly muslim but besides that theyre far closer culturally to say italy than they are to pakistan or indonesia or even a place like saudi arabia they also have deep trade connections to the eu and make up half of the mediterraneans coastline economic migrants from these regions also make up the backbone of many european economies and its in europes best interest to stabilize these countries and help them grow economically with the exception of egypt and turkey they also all have populations less than existing eu members so they wouldnt alter the balance of power that much on the subject on immigration the sahara desert is also a bunch more defensible border than the mediterranean sea if you care about that culturally many of these states once attempted to emulate european secularism but failed somewhat due to europe closing them off and refusing cooperation or even harming them i think opening those doors again and making it clear that the eu values these people would make democratic and secular using reforms much more popular in the long run im not saying that these countries should join tomorrow far from it just that they should be given that goal states like tunisia lebanon and israel would be a good place to start if expansion was considered although again not at the current moment given their instability i also think that encouraging cultural exchange through programs like eurovision nato and european sports leagues would be a good first step at improving relations i think europe as a cultural zone should end with the zagros mountains urals caspian sea arabian desert and sahara desert and i think as we move into a more globalized world that will become clearer and clearer,human

256,we need to bring back flexible spelling to combat false allegations of ai usepeople are being accused of having ai do their writing for them i feel that one solution might be to return to when it was acceptable to spell things different ways my theory is that the ai will stick to traditionally accepted spellings and that can create an obvious difference between human generated and ai generated writing i get that it probably wont take long for the ai programs to catch on but a temporary solution is better than no solution also i believe that our insistance on everyone using the same exact wording every time can be distracting for example are you still paying attention or were you distracted by the fact that i spelled insistence with an a is that level of distraction really the fault of the writer if their point is clear anyway yes their our homophones but these are usually cleared up by context seelet the ais be anal and give us our creativity back if there are many ways to spell shawn why shouldnt there be a couple of ways to spell regular words,human
257,the one drop rule is completely outdated and people who are mixed with black should not automatically be considered blackthe one drop rule is a relic of the olden days and people who are mixed with black are not necessarily black for example celebrities such as zendaya meghan markle and her children halsey and mariah carey are not black people  rather they are mixed with black and in my opinion that is its own unique identity  i am not denying that mixed people can also face discrimination or racism that black people do i also believe that mixed people should be able to identify however they want to within reason  but it is just absurd that someone is automatically considered black just because they have some black parentage the one drop rule is completely outdated i will argue that it never should have existed in the first place and the rationale behind it is undeniably racist i also dont really believe in race and that it can be qualified but race is still very relevant in our society but oh well,human

261,the t in lgbtq should be removedthis is by no means a hate post just my opinion lgbtq community are people who are not heterosexual when a trans person transitions they simply change their gender ex im a biological female if i wanted to be male i can do that and identify as male i would still be heterosexual given i am attracted to women but if i transitioned from female to male and was attracted to men as a trans man then i would be considered gay and apart of the lgbtq community i understand that its more than being lgbtq but if trans people really want to be accepted as the gender they identify as why would you put yourself in this group why not just identify as male or female and let that be it,human
262,i think the voting age should become 21 and not 18please read completely  the voting age currently is 18 for everyone in the us united states i respect that and know it was a choice it is one of the amendments the 18th in the constitutionthe age of 18 can be considered mostly for everyone an adult or young adult starting adult but since this is the case i see it as this not being a good age for voting they are barely getting out of the teen phase and starting the life on an adult focusing on other stuff driving and licenses being a house owner and similar stuff and this stuff is considered overwhelming for them with all that info not saying that it can affect voting but this is just an experiencing phase of what really an adult is for themignoring all the stuff that comes into voting and what you got to know when you vote decisions about the presidents how it will affect us what will happen you really have to make sure who you are voting for and like they say each vote is important and it counts another reason why i think they should vote when older even their bodys arent fully developed the brain of an individual havent finished developing their brain until 21 which can be considered a good age like an official adultthey also experienced more things in life obviously than people of age 18 having more benefits and freedom like drinking and similar stuff since they experienced more it would be another reason why this age of voting is good 21that age 21 is a good voting age that would be required for anyone that wants to vote compared to the age of 18 they are more responsible have more knowledge over life and the brains of those individuals are more developed making them an actual adultplease tell me if you agree with my view or if not  ps i have more similar other views to talk about and didnt know if i could put two in the same post so i just made one view can a moderator tell me if i can or not,human
263,the civil rights movement is now backfiring and hurting people of colorin the 1960s the united states passed civil rights legislation in an effort to make the country more just for people of color  this seemed like the right thing to do after all nobody should be discriminated against because of the color of their skin people of color now hold positions of power and authority were unthinkable in the 1960s  this is a good thing because corporations and the government should look like the populations they serve  however corporations now have diversity hiring policies that favor applicants of color  this means that if the applicant pool for a position is narrowed down to two equally qualified applicants  one who is white and one who is a person of color  more often than not the job will be given to the person of color we outlawed this type or discrimination with respect to people of color almost 60 years ago yet it is perfectly acceptable to treat white americans this way where they are judged by the color of their skin instead of their qualifications the unstated justification is that it is retribution for years of segregation jim crow slavery and other unfair treatment of black americans however this is not equality it is simply putting the shoe on the other foot  it is also creating a backlash that is hurting people of color and eroding the progress the civil rights movement has made  donald trump was elected president in 2016 largely because there are many white people in this country who are tired of being told that they are bad people because they are white  trump tapped into the white majoritys anger and resentment he also put three ultra conservative justices on the supreme court who are probably going to rule that affirmative action at universities is unconstitutional  this is a gift to white americans but it will exclude many brown and black americans from higher education we appear to be sliding backwards in terms of civil rights and my theory is that it is because our previous attempts to create a more equal society ended up disenfranchising the majority  so now we are slowly coming full circle to where we started 60 years ago,human

265,decision makers in the financial industry should be licensedfinancial institutions are in charge of other peoples money therefore when they breach that trust not only should they lose thier job they should be barred from that industry in the future license revokedi think this should apply to all who had an impact that would be ceo cfo and any risk management people and possibly board members we need to curb risky behavior and permanently being removed from thier career should be an option often times criminal behavior isnt provable but negligence when dealing with other people money should exclude you from being able to do it again when we look at svb we see certain people grabbing their money and running those seem to have advanced knowledge of a collapse and there should be punishment to anyone who had insider information and acted as well i support making depositors whole but people caused this issue and there has to be real long term consequences for them to change my view why wouldnt licensing solve this or maybe a better solution to hold the decision makers accountable,human

267,you can be severely depressed andor anxious without having a blatantly obvious reason and its not because of character or moral defectsso i just want to start off by saying that ive have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression on multiple occasions and have mild anxiety ive had some small hard things but for the most part ive had a pretty affluent and smooth lifei know that i feel miserable and that i by definition meet the standards for severe clinical depression x amount of symptoms for most days for 2 weeks that impairs daily functioning even with meeting the criteria for depression i can function somewhat well i have friends and a jobive gotten implicit and explicit messages from family friends coworkers and society that mental illness isnt real and if they are that only severely traumatized people get depressed or severe mental illnesses or that there has to be this big reason for someone to have depression and if anyone claims otherwise theyre just lazyselfishwimpy while i think that big life events is a big factor for mental illnesses the idea of trauma is relative whats traumatic for me may not be traumatic for you so its unfair to say that only people who go through big traumas can have mental illnessesalso genetics have some impact here i dont want to get in the whole nature vs nurture debate but i feel like its fair to say theres at least some genetic or physiological component to depressionand lastly ive worked my butt off i go to therapy multiple times a week take psychiatric medications work out daily have a job see friends do daily self help stuff have hobbies and eat relatively well yet i still feel deeply depressed sometimestldr i wantchoose to believe that mental illness is real and doesnt have to have an obvious cause this doesnt make the individual lazy stupid or whatever and depression isnt just a matter of sucking it up and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps having a mental illness doesnt have to be justified by some major tragic event nor does it mean you failed at life,human
268,qanon was a purposeful operation attempt to create division between americansweve all seen the effects of qanon  what started on 4chan or 8chan and seems to most outsiders to be a larp of a qlevel clearance government operative spilling state secrets but was determined to be an account that near anyone could post upon for an unverified amount of time and pointing a finger at a global takeover by literal satanists had spiraled into a few offshoots with varying levels of wacky conspiratorial flare    a trump was still the president there was a legal doctrine declaring him as such  he was going to come back into power with a military coup    b same as a but his vp of his new world was going to be a resurrected jfk jr  c a few more believable theories that simply state that the democrats are trying to eradicate american culture and trump and consequently a fascist regime by the political right was the only answer  now for a time i thought this was dumb luck  some rightleaning people with a flare for manipulation of the more mentally follower minds found their niche  but over time and with whispers of russian bots influencing elections and certain rightwing talking heads senators and news anchors seemingly expounding positive reactions to a white christofascist russian society with no separation of church and state made me scratch my head  at this time i genuinely feel there is more to it  this thought contagion of qanon has certainly done some damage to american cohesiveness  i just want someone to tell me this isnt the case tbh,human
269,whilst learning about lived experience is important deferring to people for answers on what one should or shouldnt do purely because of their unchosen characteristics is illogical and ironically bigoted hi all i appreciate getting feedback from people who are involved in an issue but theres a worryingly ever growing trend of deferring to people purely because of their unchosen characteristics instead of the quality of their logic the evidence they provide and their ethical reasoning and thats what we should always be basing our decisions off of not the speakers characteristics etc   for those who dont know unchosen characteristics refers to any aspect of a person that they did not choose eg sex race sexuality birthplace etc   after all there is no universal consensus on any issue on the planet held by such groups and if someone assumed otherwise that would be incredibly bigoted   as there is no universal consensus there will always be disagreements that require additional criteria to discern the quality of the argument eg two xgroup people are saying opposite things how do i decide who to listen to and the answer is the quality of their logic the evidence they provide and their ethical reasoning which of course means that often the whole exercise is a pointless one in the first place as we should be prioritising our capacity for understanding logic evidence and ethics not listening to x person for the sole reason that they have y unchosen characteristics   i think that listening to lived experience is important re listening to lived experience eg all x groups experience y problem that z group wasnt aware of but thats not the same as deferring to people on decision making because of their unchosen characteristics   i try to have civil productive discussions but thats getting harder and harder these days   for those who appreciate civil dialogue feel free to skip this for those who dont i humbly ask that you refrain from personal attack its irrelevant to the question ask clarifying questions instead of assuming stay on topic answer questions that are asked of you and as the above points to   provide evidence for claims that require it   provide logical reasoning for claims that require it   provide ethical reasoning for claims that require it   i will not engage with uncivil people here,human
270,voting should be mandatory in democratic countrieslisten up folks in democratic countries low voter turnout is a serious problem that cannot be ignored according to the international institute for democracy and electoral assistance more than 70 countries around the world hold elections where less than half of eligible voters actually cast their ballothttpswwwideaintdatatoolsdatavoterturnout the united states is a perfect example of this in the 2016 presidential election voter turnout was only 557httpsenmwikipediaorgwikivoterturnoutinunitedstatespresidentialelectionstextmcdonalds20voter20turnout20data20forvap20turnout20of2054925  thats less than 6 out of 10 eligible voters who actually took part in deciding the future of their country how can we call this a true democracythats why i firmly believe that mandatory voting is the solution we need mandatory voting would not only help ensure that every citizen has a say in their government but it would also encourage greater civic engagement and political awareness critics argue that forcing people to vote is a violation of their individual freedom but i call bs on that in reality not voting is just as much an act of political expression as casting a lottery when people choose not to vote theyre effectively letting other people make decisions for them and lets be honest those people are usually the ones with the most money and power if we want to level the playing field and make sure everyone has a say in government mandatory voting is the way to gonow you might argue that forcing people to vote will lead to uninformed or careless voting but let me tell you this is not the case look at australia where voting has been mandatory for decades their voter turnout consistently hovers around 90 and theres no evidence that people are making random or careless decisions at the polls in fact mandatory voting has actually increased civic engagement and political awareness among the population in brazil where mandatory voting was introduced in the 1930s voter turnout is around 80 compared to the 40 seen in the usmandatory voting is just one of many factors that affect voter turnout and it cant be expected to solve all the problems on its own but we need to start somewhere and mandatory voting is a nobrainersome opponents of mandatory voting may argue that it is difficult to enforce and that people will simply show up to the polls and spoil their ballot however there are ways to address these concerns in australia for example those who fail to vote without a valid reason are fined and in brazil voters who fail to cast their ballot without justification can face a range of penalties including being banned from getting a passport or a drivers licenseso whats the holdup lets make voting mandatory and ensure that every voice is heard and dont give me any of that freedom nonsense  the freedom to stay home and do nothing is not a freedom worth fighting for the benefits of mandatory voting are clear higher voter turnout more representative governments and greater civic engagement if you think you can change my view you better come with some real facts and figures because mandatory voting is a nobrainer and its time we made it a reality,human

274,sex education should become more opendisclaimer im writing from israel and was raised here i have a bit of experience living in usa too so thats my perspectivei think sex education is really bad even nowadays with all the talk about being the importance of being open with feelings and good communicationsex will always be somewhat embarrassing to talk with our parents its not an easy subject for sure nonetheless i think it is crucial to talk with kids about itthe school is a place that should give life skills in addition to profession skills like mathematics and english if it wasnt saw you might as well argue to also cancel the humanities in school though a small portion of society can earn a living from it  academia writers etc hence i believe that a crucial aspect of human life like sex should be talked more about even if its very embarrassing of course rules should be enforced so discussions dont slide to problematic areas as a teenager i had a class on sexual education it went like  1 use condoms 2 sexual diseases 3 sexual harassment consent and rapeas many before me said its important to speak of the importance of pleasure for both the importance of feeling good with your body toxic relationships for men and women in heterorelationships or gay etc the anxiety it might provoke and how to live a good sex life,human

276,incel ideology is deliberately tailored to lower mens confidence to exploit them for financial or political gainin my view incel ideology despite proposing to be a support structure for men a way of understanding the world and the incel movement an mens rights one its pretty obvious that the entire thing is a deliberately designed to lower mens confidence and prey on their insecurity for financial and political gainincel ideology is the idea that women are the biologically and socially privileged gender and their role as the gatekeepers of sex privileges them affording them the ability to choose sex with only the most masculine and attractive men generally measured by success wealth looks etc this draws a line between men as an underclass and women as a dominant power and further divides men between the privileged and the unfortunate this breeds an attitude of insecurity and victimisationfirst off i must note i dont believe in a big cabal trading notes to crush mens spirits or whatever i simply see opportunists seeing easy cash or support for a political cause and jumping on board financially its wellknown insecurity is easy to target financially and lots of money is made selling the idea that people should be insecure its what most of advertisement is built on beauty ads depict unreasonable standards to make you want to buy their product we see people like andrew tate demean men and say theyre hopeless if they cant be like him being like him is often accessed by means that fund andrew tates lavish lifestyle alex jones uses insecurity about the american future to sell supplements as well as push a political agendathat leads to political gain your frustrated insecure men are a potent radicalisation target for any political ideology that stands against the status quo these are known to be key recruiting groups for fascists providing order hierarchy and a place in the world that seems to be united against them chief strategist of the trump admin steve bannon even admits it httpswwwnewsweekcomstevebannontargetedincelsmanipulatecambridgeanalyticawhistleblowerchristopherwylie1468399utmcampaignnewsweektwitteramputmmediumsocialamputmsourcetwitterdespite claims to supporting mens liberation confidence and health incel thought leaders continue to promote completely false baseless idiotic ideas sexual market value hypergamy misogyny the chad and stacy but unironic etc all designed to make men less confident in themselves and thus more easy to manipulate or more hostile to women and thus making them unable to rectify these problems and gain more selfconfidence they have no reason to promote such ludicrous theory apart from their own gain and as seen above they have much to gain and the demographics that feed into the incel community have much to giveall in all it seems obvious to me that incel ideology is astroturfed by political and financial interests who benefit more from mens suffering than their happiness and health creating a selfperpetuating pool of the vulnerable and exploitable seems to be the end result of the pushing of such ideas and concious of this or not the people who push it can benefit tremendously and its very nature discourages seeking help from outside of incel circles very similar to cult mentality which of course is similarly abused by many for political or financial gain,human

sentenceall suffering of sentient beings must be avoided by humans if possible even at high costthis is further extrapolated as follow    if an animals possesses a nervous system no matter how simplistic it is then it needs to to have equivalent rights as humans because by having nervous system such animal is thus sentient and thus capable of suffering this line is extremely arbitrary by a simple philosophical and neuropsychologic point of view this extrapolation of the definition of suffering is absurd like a small child that covers their teddy bears with a sheet so they can be more comfortable vegans are people that seem to have confused empathy and projections to how actually emotions are formulated on a human brain nevermind the fact that vegans try to preach this dogma and all the full set of rules of how to live like a cultlike religion and fail to understand that moral is relative if a group of people fail to impose their moral view to other group they are the one seen as immoral by the other group  this is also another point i often seen being misused a lot lately not understanding the difference between moral and ethics and how moral is relative to specific set of values of a group and not necessarily superior to a different groups set of values only religious people deals in absolutist morals secular people trend however with a more logical approach in the field of formal ethics sometimes we see vegans trying to arguments about how harming another animal is unethical and that is also a misconception that ill deal ahead   returning to the problem of suffering one can draw several deconstructionists rhetorics to dismantle the need of veganism in the first placea how can one objectively define suffering from simple animals such as insects bees or even fish if you consider the concept of qualia in philosophy the answer is pretty simple it cant be it is all subjective projection from human perspective thus the second point b why avoid negative neurological stimuli at all why is it so bad isnt pain part of life would a pup deprived of all negative stimuli in all of its life even mature properly   stating that all negative stimuli should be avoided at all costs is again arbitrary why stop at natural life and neurons modern ai simulations can be based on two types of simplistic stimuli to evolve a neuralnetwork avoidable and pursuable stimuli equally to a simple insect in fact there are computer simulations more complex than insects currently running in many tech universities around the world shouldnt anything causing negative stimuli be avoided at all costs even in artificial machines created by humansc even if you ignore the concept of qualia or the definition of suffering why draw the lines at neurons specifically and what kind of neurons one must possess to be considerable negatively enough of a stimuli nociceptors  plants also act according to positive and negative stimuli in nature heat cold sunlight and even pressuresensitive receptors ie carnivore plants d if you must avoid negative stimuli of all animals possessing a nervous system then shouldnt people also stop washing their faces altogether as doing so kills hundreds of commensal mites that live in your eyelashes known as demodex this is an example of how extremely low this line has been drawn and how ihenrently an appeal to emotion it is in fact as someone with a neuropsychology background and following the concept of simple negative stimuli being simply a biological mechanism that doesnt generate suffering in itself suffering is a far more complex human concept and extrapolating it to any simple negative stimuli is a misplaced empathy projection at best i can say with certainty that not only insects cant actually suffer like humans do neither do other creatures such as crustaceans echinoderms mollusks or even fish any attempt to try and compare a fish splashing on a deck to a human experiencing all the emotional trauma of suffocating is ludicrousallowing fish to feel pain or bees to work more for producing more honey to replenish the ones we take will not cause a quantum disbalance in the subatomic scale that would rip the fabric of space time apart or drag your soul to hell like your dogma makes people think it will pain does not annihilates gluons this is just arbitrary oversensitivity nonsense that wont make you morally superior than omnivorous there is however a much more complex discussion to be made about if higher mammals like pigs dogs or cows actually experience suffering like humans and if selfawareness and consciousness are needed for that i personally would draw the line in not causing suffering to animals with consciousness like great apes cetaceans and some birds no chickens definitely do not have enough telencephalon to have consciousness even if they do feel pain you can try and bring the bar down to cows and pigs too and id gladly bring qualia back again to justify how without consciousness this is only projection and oversensitivity but that is a much longer discussion and also irrelevant because fundamentally vegans only bring the suffering of pigs dogs and cows as an appeal to emotion of how much they suffer compared to our precious little pets the inherent fundament of veganism has already been deconstructed above you can chose to not eat cows or pigs because you personally feel bad about then that is absolutely fine but there is absolutely no logic in refraining from eating shrimp tuna or honey because there is no reason to follow an arbitrary line created by a cultlike pseudoscientific dogma now one may extrapolate and try to ignore the moral core of veganism and try to formulate environmental and health arguments but for those you arent trending within the veganism radical bonds anymore and we can start and construct a more sensible argument in favor of more sustainable and humane pecuarian production instead of completely and nonsensically getting entirely rid of it,human
283,dr fatima cody standford is misdirecting americai have recently in the past few months become obsessed with obesity looking at the data its so hard not to be pessimistic about the future of civilization as harvard projects close to half of the usas population will be obese by 2030 1 im not going to trying to convince people that they shouldnt be obese that is a personal choice someone is going to have to make im also not going to tell people that they shouldnt love who they are or be happy with themselveshowever what i do think is that america has a serious problem and its stubbornness is not helping before i start my rant in the title let me go through a few points that i think are very important nutrition education in america is absolutely terrible in the public school system i could go on and on about how lobbying has destroyed every iteration of the food pyramid or now it is called myplate if you wanted to do your own research on that i highly recommend 2 from my personal anecdotal experience i hope some of you can provide your own outside of elementary school we were not taught anything else about nutrition i was taught the food pyramid which said you should have 611 servings of carb filled foods everyday its no wonder that people dont understand much about nutrition its taught to you at an age that you dont even know how to cook or even close to being able to understand your body what they teach you still doesnt teach you what the different macronutrients do why you need them and why is it important at allim not going to say that parents arent to blame but they are also just products of a country that prides its freedom and profits over longevity and happiness semirant overi recently got introduced to dr fatima cody standford a health expert on the biden administration from her 60 minutes 3 in this interview she claims that the leading cause of obesity is genetics and that it is a brain disease that causes their body to not be able to lose weight i was a bit stunned as a knee jerk reaction as im sure most people were after thinking about it and reading a few other of articles in which she is interviewed i still disagreeim not saying she isnt partially right however i think you cant realistically say that obesity is mainly caused by genetics at least statistically there are a few things i would like to point out1 if obesity was majorly caused by genetics then you would expect that obesity levels would have always stayed around the same however we are not seeing that as the obesity levels are rising every year at dramatic rates 42 if obesity was majorly caused by genetics you would expect europe to have similar obesity rates to america we dont see this at all i think these statistics are a bit outdated however it can be seen that in europe generally is about 10 behind america in obesity prevalence 5 most americans lineage derives from europe if obesity was majorly genetically linked we would expect that europe would have about the same obesity prevalence as americain another article standford claims that this is the largest chronic disease worldwide not just here in the us yes everybody assumes its a us issue were actually ranked number 14 out of 200 countries so were not awardwinning were not number 1 but were behind 13 other countries so this is a major global issue 6what standford fails to mention is that that 12 out of the 13 countries above us are island nations with insanely small populations and the only one that is notable is kuwait which has a population a little over 3 million no where close to the population of the usa this is such a lousy argument and seems like she is coping with how bad the problem has gotten in america im not saying that obesity isnt a global issue it most certainly is however we are the leading first world country of obesity i think dismissing this and saying oh we arent number one is so ignorantly dismissive and loses credibility towards her arguments at least for meso where does this leave us well im glad you asked in my opinion obesity can be attributed to a lot of different aspects of our lives the list is long genetics processed foods plague america loads of sugars are caked into everything children adopt the diets of their parents there isnt enough proper education of nutrition and the number one reason of all personal choice and the fact that most people simply just dont care about their health it can be an entire other post about this so im not going to go into it at some point for an individual this spirals out of control and becomes chronic obesity in which there isnt much that can be done to help an individual besides medications or surgery and to the point in which standford calls a brain diseasei dont think we can sit there and point a finger at one specific aspect of obesity and say this is what is wrong its not different than what we have done in the past blaming fat or blaming carbs on people becoming unhealthy none of these macronutrients are harmful by nature but too much or too little isnow this is when i get a little angry im sure most people have seen the recent craze about ozempic generically called semaglutide as many of you probably already know this is a drug to treat type 2 diabetes but has the side effect of losing weight dr standford is pushing this drug heavily she consults pharma companies and touts this drug heavily while also being apart of the biden administration she claims in this news interview that these medications are making people realize that their weight changes are not all their fault while i have read up and have seen the benefits of this drug and it does work albeit with a lot of side effects it doesnt change the fact that once these people are off the drug they will just regain the weight the lostas this article from the journal of diabetes obesity and metabolism says one year after withdrawal of onceweekly subcutaneous semaglutide 24mg and lifestyle intervention participants regained twothirds of their prior weight loss with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health 7 this article states that ozempic is only safe to use up to 68 weeks 8i think dr standford is being a shill for these pharmaceutical companies promising a miracle drug that will fix your problems i agree with her that how we think about obesity is wrong but i think shes is going down the wrong path by scapegoating genetics instead of trying to help fix a systemic multifaceted issueanecdotally it seems that most people want simple solutions to complex issues in all aspects of lifelet me know how you all feel about this issue i would love to hear personal anecdotes and direct criticisms of my logicthank you all for reading,human
284,transgender women have inherent privilege of cis womenmen top women in everything sports corporate  doctors lawyers  physical strength etc you name it men have a advantage over women i go as far to say they rule the world it would disingenuous to say they do noti say this to say this is why trans women have innate privilege over cis women due to the privilege that their sex hold over us it is easy for alot of them to maneuver into womens spaces without issues when met with opposition   women or the parties opposing trans women in certain cis spaces are met with insults and law suitstake example womens sports beauty representation etc there is almost always a tran woman included in representation for cis women but trans men almost never are included in representation for men since females are see as lesser its like we dont have the power to assert the authority for what is acceptable in everything that pertains to us if you have males who dont want trans men in their spaces without doubt i think that men would very much make it known however its not many trans men fighting to be the representation for men and be included in their spaces being that their female sex naturally makes them less adaptable to all that comes with being in cis men spaces agression  competition  strength  etc key characteristics of males its almost as if trans women have a entitlement attitude to be included in all  womens spaces even those which are tied to our sex trans men tend to lack that entitlement due to their female sex making them less power in comparison to malesfor example take things like womens sports prison placement for trans people  the bathroom debate women representation in context and consideration almost all the controversy is with trans women being in female spaceswith sports alot the oppsition comes from trans women being physically superior to cis women with the bathrooms the opposition comes from lack of privacy  riskconcearn of sexual assault same thing for womens prisions brands such as ulta victoria secret include trans women in womens beauty promotion however you rarely hear trans men fighting to be in mens sports fighting to use men bathrooms be housed in mens facilities prisons  shelters etc 1 notable reason is alot them still have their vaginas so would be very susceptible to sex based violence  the other is i think that trans men realize this disadvantage they will have in male spaces due to their sex,human
285,vinyl is an objectively bad audio storage format when compared to digitaldisclaimer im not an audio engineer scientist or audiophile i dont own any vinyl records im a relative layman and my primary interest is computer science but im looking to learn more about audio formatsas you might know vinyl has been going through a resurgence in the last decade or so i dont have issues with that and im indifferent to people buying vinyl to collect physical media or for nostalgic reasons however i do take issue with some people claiming the vinyl is simply better than any digital audio formats saying that there is something irreplaceable with vinyl sound and that its simply the best format for storing audio here is why i disagree1 it distorts the recorded sound in my mind an audio format should have only one primary goal  to be able to reproduce a recording that was put onto it as closely as possible now vinyl was a good and cheap solution for its time but in comparison to modern technology it seems very outdated think of the stereotypical vinyl sound  the hissing noise with scratchy cracking sounds ive never heard a vinyl recording that didnt feature these distortions and it points to an inability to record cleansounding audio which is bad add to that the potential distortion from other sources like a turntable not spinning at precisely the right speed and it feels like analog formats like these are just worse im not saying these are major factors that everyone will care a whole lot about but reciting the first sentence  if the goal is to reproduce recorded sound as closely as possible then i dont think anything can rival a digital recording with a digital format the only difference between the audio you have and the audio that the music producers had is the equipment that you play it on2 its not really subjective a fairly common argument to give credence to vinyl is that people simply experience music differently hence why the artifacts and noise in a recording might actually be enjoyed by someone but why should we want that  and more importantly is this unique to vinyl seriously to offer a comparison  were pretty decent at grading and comparing for example monitor color reproduction with that industry there is such a thing as simply being better  a monitor having better brightness contrast color accuracy etc if no one wants to view everything on a distorted monitor why would anyone want to listen to distorted music and speaking about these artifacts couldnt they just be reproduced digitally if needed since its all just sound i dont see what would stop someone from recording a vinyl to digital or making a digital filter and getting the exact same listening experience3 it seems extremely fragile ideally a storage format should be fairly durable digital is perfect or almost perfect with this  if you record digital data it will always stay identical no matter how much you access it this of course excludes the possibility of the actual storage medium like a hard drive degrading and breaking down but even then the digital data can be easily duplicated indefinitely the 10000th copy will be identical to the first on the other hand not only will analog recordings degrade in quality as they are copied but vinyl just seems extremely fragile even in the audiophile circles there seem to always be discussions on keeping records dustfree clean temperaturecontrolled and so on but even then temperature fluctuations and just mere normal use with the needle scratching the records surface will eventually wear it down how is this not viewed as a major flaw of the format if i had a record that i knew was going to wear down quickly just by playing it id probably not play it at all to avoid damaging it when comparing this to infinite replayability of a digital format this seems like a nobrainer to me,human

287,cheesecake is actually pie not cakeits pi day 3 14 today so lets talk about whether cheesecake is really a pie cheesecake of course has cake as part of the name but is it really a pie is typically something like a baked dish with a filling on top and a base of pastry whereas a cake is typically something like a baked sweet breadlike dish made from a dough mixture of flour shortening eggs sugar and leavening while there is some overlap and also there are always some weird outlier cases it seems to me that youre typical cheesecake fits better into the category of pie than into the category of cake change my view,human
288,support for the phrase trans women are women is completely orthogonal to trans social policyi see the phrase trans women are women as being a totally semantic debate a protrans person and an antitrans person who have both read and fully understood all the research being done on this topic would not disagree about any of the following statements with current technology trans women dont produce eggs with current technology trans women cant get pregnant with current technology the overwhelming majority of trans women have xy chromosomes with current technology trans women who medically transition have some of the secondary sex characteristics typical of cis womenthe question of what relationship any of those things have to the word woman is where the entirety of this particular part of the debate takes place and that cant be answered by science itself its a basic lumpers vs splittershttpsenwikipediaorgwikilumpersandsplitters debate should we have lots of specific tiny subcategories or a few larger supercategories and what are the exact borders of each categorization scheme theres no objective answer to this question  its all about what turns out to be useful and convenient for people in a field to talk aboutbut theres another issue theres also no necessary connection between acceptance of the phrase trans women are women and the belief that trans women and cis women should be treated 100 equally under social policycis women with serious medical conditions that make it dangerous for them to play sports are women but as a society we should ideally do some gatekeeping to keep them out of most sportsclearly merely being a woman isnt enough to justify including someone in womens sports as long as there are specific traits a person might have that justifies such exclusion the question then becomes whether trans women have any traits that might justify their exclusion from a given womens sport and my general approach is that i trust international sports bodies to eventually reach rules that will be appropriate to any empirical facts about each sport on a casebycase basisthat might look like the world rugby association banning trans womenhttpswwwnytimescom20201026sportsolympicsworldrugbytransgenderwomenhtml from its womens sports categories while other international sporting bodies might opt for full trans inclusion sporting rules are essentially arbitrary and every sport has to decide what kind of competitions they want if people dont like it they can also create new sporting bodies with more exclusive or inclusive categories if they want and have them compete in the free market for money and attentionsports is sort of a side example in any case the real meat of the question is for topics tied to daytoday life do the rights and needs of cis women and trans women ever come into conflict and if so how should we resolve such conflictsno right is absolute in any system of liberal democracy every liberal democracy has to decide if the freedom of religion includes the permission to sacrifice animals as part of religious practice or marry more than one woman or refuse lifesaving blood transfusions to children in the united states weve decided that the state can ban all of those practices without violating the freedom of religiontrans people have rights under liberal democracy but it is for each liberal democracy to determine where the edges of those rights are and what to do in claimed areas of conflictjk rowlings old tweetgt dress however you pleasegtgt call yourself whatever you likegtgt sleep with any consenting adult wholl have you gtgt live your best life in peace and security gtgt but force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real gtgt istandwithmaya thisisnotadrillis a fundamentally liberal position shes for trans tolerance in a wide variety of social circumstances but in a few limited domains like bathrooms and prisons she doesnt think that inclusions should be extended for alleged safety concerns in a representative democracy people have to vote in politicians who they trust to weigh such claims and shape policy around dealing with conflicts and limits of rights that might arisein any case my core argument is that the following are both possible a person believes trans women are women and that specific decisions for where to include or exclude trans people should be done on a case by case or domain by domain basis a person believes trans women are not women and that trans women should be allowed to have access to every social space that cis women are allowed in,human
289,human extinction from climateenvironmental issues is not a serious threati see a lot of people on social media and certain political commentators who claim humanity is heading towards extinction in the relatively near future lets say the next century or two due to climate changebut it seems like virtually no experts are making these kinds of claims populations experts are forecasting for human population to increase for the next 4070 years before slowly dropping for the next century afterwards due to declining birth rates they give no indication of expected mass die offs at all much less actual extinction level die offs it is my view that there is no good reason to think human extinction from climate changeenvironmental degradation is even a real threat on any sort of timescale meaningful to us i believe people who speak of this coming extinction are almost likely driven by either post apocalyptic fantasies or have been propagandized by politicalcorporate interests who seek more moneypower and find fearmongering to be an effective way to achieve their goals,human

291,fighting serves no purpose in hockey anymore and should just be bannedi grew up watching and enjoying fighting in ice hockey but over the years ive come to find it to be a bit of a sideshow hockey is a sport that rewards speed coordination reaction time and physicality the idea that youre just going to stop that game every now and then for a bareknuckle boxing match when you really think about it is kind of absurd the typical argument you hear in favour of fighting is that it serves as a form of selfpolicing among players outside of a few anecdotes im not sure this is supported by any data leagues where fighting isnt permitted dont have a higher incidence of violent illegal hits in my experience its leagues where fighting is more pronounced that have a tendency to be more goonish in general just look at the old nhl i dont think anyone would suggest that since the nhl made fighting more rare the league has become more violent or dangerous quite the opposite its proved that a different approach to officiating can ensure player safety without fighting if anything its clear that fighting is more of a hazard to player safety than anything how many guys end up with serious health issues stemming from that repeated head trauma to say nothing of those who have actually been killed on the iceit creates a race to the bottom where teams feel they need to have players on the ice whose value is derived from being obscenely physical since the opposing team has one of those players you need one too and so on then theres a critical mass of players on either team who cant really contribute beyond their ability to potentially hurt other players its just an arms race i think the real argument for fighting is that some fans enjoy watching it its not about player safety its not about the code but if you want to watch a fight watch mma the nhls rule changes that have greatly restricted fighting have also allowed it to become a more graceful skillful game id rather see the cale makars and connor mcdavids of the world do what they do then see a few guys who can barely skate rearrange each others faces a couple times a game,human

297,sex is a desire not a needim asexual and i just dont get it when people call sex their physical needs  a need is something you can not literally survive without food water air even human connection are needs a desire is a deep craving for something it is not the same as a need   sex is not a need if it was asexuals who dont indulge and celibate people would have died after a while you will not die just because you didnt have sex like you will if you go without water for a year saying that sex is a need is the same as saying that alcohol is a need just because you crave it as hell it is a stupid just a stupid phrase to call sex your physical needs  and were not talking about the need of survival of the human race on earth no by sex is a desire not a need i mean that it is not necessary for a human to survive  of course im asexual and dont understand the idea of sex being fun so if someone is able to help me see how its a need for allos ill be willing to change my view,human

300,aipowered dating app bots that get you dates are ethicalgot tired of wasting so much time on all my dating apps just to scrape together a date or two a month so as a passion project i decided to build an aipowered dating app bot that could do all the swiping and chatting for me to get numbers using dating apps i found that once i actually got a girls number and could call her i could usually build enough rapport with my charisma to schedule a dateit was important to me to make sure the bot only swiped right on girls that were actually my type it was also crucial that when the bot chatted with my matches it sounded like me and used as few possible back and forths as possible to get the number once i got the number i would call the girl build rapport and schedule a date this wasnt easy to build the bot is designed to learn my preferences based on my previous matches allowing it to understand my type of girl and engage in meaningful conversations that are tailored to my interests this was built using a fine tuned version of gpt3 trained on 5k conversations that got a girls number and mobilenet v3 for classifying my type the results have been astounding in the first month the bot scheduled 13 dates for me all of which were with girls who matched my preferences and had similar interests to mine i no longer have to waste time swiping aimlessly or struggling to come up with conversation starters whats important here is that when i call the girl i explain to them that they were talking to a bot on the dating app so far every girl has laughed it off and been impressed that i could build such a thing were living in the cambrian explosion of ai excited to see it improve our lives in more areas,human
301,movie critics should stop reviewing mcu moviesok now this isnt necessarily a fullyformed opinion but i think theres something here so please hear me out and help me poke some holes in itmany critics of the latest few marvelmcu movies eg antman and the wasp quantumania black panther wakanda forever thor love and thunder have left reviews along the lines of there are too many marvel movies the tropes are tired and the beats are predictable is this a valid opinion to have yes of course is this a useful criticism of the 35th installation in a superhero movie franchise i would say nomy opinion is that mcu movies reached a point probably after infinity war of being nerdy enough that the only people in the public still watching them are people that have watched allmost of them enjoy the superhero trope and appreciate the weird universeexpanding formatat this point its like a comic franchise imagine if critics reviewed each new marvel comic by saying there are too many superhero comics the tropes are tired thats not a fair criticism of a marvel comic so should it be of a marvel moviethe critics rotten tomatoes score of quantumania is 47 and the audiences score is 83 this to me perfectly illustrates that the consumers of marvel movies are generally much more bought into the format than the average critic people who are sick of superhero movies are no longer watching these movies and will not go see the next movie depending on critics opinions  so to round up my opinion i think that most critics should stop reviewing most mcu movies maybe some stand on their own as fun stories and can be watched in isolation but the more world building weirdness there is the worse this will get and at one point critic reviews will be completely useless,human
302,i dont think there is anything that is not okay to joke abouti recently had a debate with someone who thought that certain things are not okay to laugh at and i completely disagreei think everything can be funny if the joke it told the proper way i would even say ive probably heardseen something funny about every serious sad horrific and distressing subject matterthere is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about  time amp place i dont think unsolicited jokes will be received well and thats understandable in passing on the street at work at school or even among friends if someone comes to a show or chooses to watchlisten to media with jokes i think that those are the few places where everything is okay to joke about telling a sexist joke to someone while they looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time so given the proper time and place i think everything has the green light i am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way im not saying no one will be offended doesnt make it less funny for some either there is nuance there is talent when it comes to jokes not everyone can write and or perform them as well as othersso lets see if you can come up with something that i have not found humorous,human

305,if youre struggling with people not using your pronouns its probably your faultexceptions if you are dealing with people who knew you pre transition and if your pronouns arent sheher or hehimif you are transgender you should put in the work to pass as the gender you feel connected with even mike tyson could pass as a woman albeit a very ugly one with the right makeup hair and outfit as a trans person if youre constantly struggling with new people not respecting your pronouns the issue is likely with you if you truly identify with the opposite gender then you must recognize that your inherent features look masculinefeminine and that you have to put in extra work to make them less apparent than someone cisgendered and if youre not willing to go that extra step then id question whether or not youre really transat the end of the day gender is a social construct if you feel so strongly with one manmade social construct over another that you would be willing to undergo permanent life altering surgery to be recognized as that other gender then putting in the work to look the part should be easy if you think no matter how i look people should accept respect and acknowledge my gender identity then thats fine and well but pretty much the sole component of the social construct of gender is your physical appearance genders are at their core physical archetypes nobody can see your chromosomes and behavior dictates nothing if you dont care to put in the work to change yourself physically then youre probably not trans,human
306,i dont agree with my poop being turned into fuelbricksin my country when you drop a turd it goes to the treatment plant where the toilet paper is ground into the poop and a chemical is added to make them bind completely the matter is then formed into brick shapes and has a burning time and measured energy output to itthese poop bricks without my permission are sold by the guberment to shady companies all around the world to operate random things i feel kind of bad my poop is fuelling machinery that makes things used to harm people etc there is a crony using my poop to make money and counting his cash and laughing while a cigar hangs from his mouth i also heard that these poop bricks are supposed to be good for the planet as recycling waste for energy but when you burn them dont they make pollutants what is going on here and why are they stealing my turds and think it is ok,human
307,i dont understand on why pronouns mean so much to transgender peopleso  i tend to not judge people for how they feel i have always been able  to accept two gay males or two gay females loving each other or even a  male transitioning into a female and a male transitioning into a female  because people who can transition to another gender scientifically is  possiblebut the whole  identifying people are they them with their pronouns is the most  ridiculous thing to me with this whole gender war happening in the world  today especially in the usa todayyou  can live life how you generally please females dont need  to be child  bearers and males dont need to be this masculine male that people so  i dont understand why someone feels the need to be addressed with a   particular set of pronouns to me its like ok i can call you that   but then it seems to me that youre just doubling down on the idea that  rigid gender differences do matter which i dont think they do youre   just you an individual person and all this crap people give with he  and she since it is what weve been using for a long time so i dont  see how a different  pronoun will change anything that matterswith  the logic from this it means that i can identify as a turkey sandwich  or a 99 year old female because the same concepts apply to what gender means to these peoplei dont mean to sound rude to people but scientifically it has never at all made sense to me so,human
308,debating about robots rights outside the realm of science fiction is ridiculousi love robot stories i think its really interesting to think about how robots would be integrated in our society from the most basic ones to complex ias that could perfectly mimic human behaviour its an interesting thoughtexperiment that can also serve really well as social commentarybut thats what it is for me fiction i cant take the idea of robots having rights seriously a robot no matter how advanced complex and human like would be nothing more than a home appliance it would be a human creation just like cars or microwaves not a human not an animal they wouldnt even be sentient just lines of codes mimicking human behaviour and thinking depending solely on our tendency to anthropomorphize nonhuman things giving robots rights is no different than giving an intelligent blender rightsi often see discussions about robots popping up here and there with some fervent defendants that they should have rights as long as they reach the point where they act just like humans which is a problematic view for whole other reasons like what does acting like humans mean so less intelligent robots that couldnt pass as humans wouldnt have rights why not but for me a robot with human like intelligence still holds less value than a fly of course im talking about the value of life here not monetary or personal importance,human
309,i believe that us organ donation should be a soft optout system not optin this argument was probably already said before but organ donation is something i feel like everyone should do i know some hard optout policies infringe on individual body liberties and choicesgovernment taking and also religious complications it was stated that 95 of americans are in favor of organ donations but only 58 are actually registered donor network west 2023 so how do we get the 37 of people to register to donate a soft optout organ donation system where everyone is defaulted presumed to want to be an organ donor those who do not want to donate would be able to optout easily through a nationwide website registry under this opt out policy those who are above 18 will be automatically added to a donor registry those who are under 18 will still need parental consent to be added to the donor registry but will automatically be added once they are 18 individuals who are unable to make their own decisions will still be added to the donor network registry but their next of kin or legal guardian can optout for them to be added to the registry you need to be a us citizen or have a ssn anyone during anytime can optout of becoming an organ donor during a death of a patient who did not optout a representative from a donor network will talk to the family and authorize the default of donation in terms of the status quo this gives the family an opportunity to ensure the potential donors preferences are regarded in the event they have not opted out for whatever reasoni feel like this is similar to the current optin system where if someone dies whether they are a donor or not a representative from a donor network still goes and asks about organ donation but in the optout system a representative goes and authorizes the default decision of organ donation if the person did not opt out this principle goes on the assumption that people will just go with the default choice on what society normally does by normalizing organ donation we can increase the number of organ donersit can make the next of kin less stressed during this time because they do not need to think about what person actually wanted because if they didnt want to donate they would have opted out in the event the next of kin does not want to donateand the deceased did not opt out then we would go by what the next of kin wanted similar to the current organ donation process i feel like this would be the best of both worlds policy it may increase the organ donation pool in a sense that people will want to go by the status quo but still take into consideration family and religious views so they can opt out for the deceasedwould there be any downsides to this policy,human

314,trumps banking deregulation was not a bad thingive been seeing a lot on reddit that trump caused the recent banking failure because he passed the 2018 economic growth act and that he was deregulating banks which caused this crisis it seems most people didnt even read the bill or understand why it was recommended by researchers at harvard kennedy school people much smarter than that orange baboon this was done for reasons outside magalandsince the doddfrank act got passed all banks with more than 10 billion in assets were treated much the same way this is good right all banks get regulated well there were more secondorder effects than regulators realized these banking regulations were applied to tiny regional and commercial banks even though they had nothing to do with the mbs shenanigans that resulted in the financial crisis regional and community banks had nothing to do with the financial crisis these are the banks that service communities and sectors that high finance regularly avoids they did not have capital markets desks that traded mbs or speculated in otc derivatives they were focused on lending to mom and pop shops and helping fund their local communities in rural more agriculture focused areas for example over 50 of small business loans made in the us were serviced by these community and regional banks and over 70 of agriculture loans were issued by regional banks these banks only hold 20 of the total capital in the financial sector these banks focus on places that jp morgan and goldman dont give a shit about regulations were killing small banks ability to compete and were leading to a rapid concentration of wealth among the biggest banks jp morgan citigroup goldman sachs bank of america etc regulators and researchers feared that having most of the wealth in the country concentrated in these banks would lead to increased wealth inequality as the regional and community banks were the only banks available in lowincome communities historically disenfranchised communities and agricultural communities that did not have access to these financial giantsthe regulations crippled small banks ability to compete with large banks in a number of ways one is that the vast number of regulatory compliance that doddfrank enacted required massive compliance departments and legal teams that banks like jp morgan could stomach the costs for while a smaller bank would be completely gutted by for example hiring just two compliance officers reversed the profitability of a smaller bank jp morgan has over 4 trillion in assets a smaller regional bank would have less than 1 of thatthe svb debacle was caused by rising interest rates making the banks htm securities hit badly svb wasnt trading dogecoin or some other random nonsense it was holding government bonds this was a black swan event not caused by simple deregulation but rather a lack of analysis by the government and poor management by the bank caused by a decade of low rates and optimism seekingalpha and short seller marc cohodes rang the alarm on svb months ago why did the government not step in a long time ago isnt that their job lcr requirements were on banks of over 75 billion in assets shouldnt their liquidity coverage ratio have triggered alarm bells for regulators other riskbased capital ratios were also required and svb was not going under the radar as it was a category 3 bank this was not a regulatory failure the svb case would be an entirely different post looking at their htm portfolio balance sheet and how it created a prisoners dilemma in which peter thiel would trigger a bank run it wasnt a 2008 situation where the bank did some goofy ninja loans nonsense and went under big banks want regulators to pass more bills and restrictions on regional banks it hurts their competition and makes capital flee to the big banks hurting commercial and regional banks hurts the little guy and in many ways it might even hurt you dear readergreat resources that ive used for this posthttpswwwhksharvardeducentersmrcbgpublicationsawpawp37httpswwwhksharvardeducentersmrcbgpublicationsawpawp37httpswwwfederalregistergovdocuments20180419201808066regulatorycapitalrulesregulatorycapitalenhancedsupplementaryleverageratiostandardsforushttpswwwfederalregistergovdocuments20180419201808066regulatorycapitalrulesregulatorycapitalenhancedsupplementaryleverageratiostandardsforushttpswwwmercatusorgresearchfederaltestimoniesregulatorylandscapeburdenssmallfinancialinstitutionshttpswwwmercatusorgresearchfederaltestimoniesregulatorylandscapeburdenssmallfinancialinstitutionshttpswwwrealclearpolicycomarticles20180523howdoddfrankhurtsthelittleguy110645htmlhttpswwwrealclearpolicycomarticles20180523howdoddfrankhurtsthelittleguy110645html,human

317,people who complain about reposts on subreddits are more painful than repostsi am excluding the botcatchers in this the people and bots that highlight automated repost bots are providing a public service and thats good what i mean is on the larger randompost subs like rnextfuckinglevel  or ridiotsincars  or whatever there is very often a top comment that is i thought it was my turn to post this or this is the third time this week or something these comments serve no purpose either people have seen the previous posts in which case your comment doesnt do anything or they havent in which case theyre redundant there is an edge case where these comments may cause a poster to check more carefully before submitting a post but even so a lot of people dont browse specific subreddits but rather rely on their subscription feed reposts are good  or certainly ok  for these users because they can just scroll past stuff theyve already seen and theyre less likely to miss good stuff that they havent seen in conclusion these repost hounds who leave comments moaning on popular posts are just  ironically  creating repetitive content and providing no significant benefit to offset the harm they cause goddamnit,human
318,relying on citations and studies ruins discussionto be clear im more specifically referring to discussion about topics related to politics economics social issues etc im not saying citations and studies are completely worthless in these areas like if you are writing a research paper you obviously need to have these things im more so talking about general discussions there are a number of issues with relying on citations and studies 1 no matter how hard academia tries to pretend these subjects are scientific they just arent attempts to use the scientific method for the humanities is honestly kind of a joke for one the studies conducted in these fields arent always concrete or reliable they are often heavily flawed in the methodology and can pretty easily be manipulated by biasses and agendas data can also pretty easily be misrepresented and misinterpreted generally speaking people dont form their opinions on these topics based on studies rather they form their opinions and then look for anything that confirms their bias 2 the majority of people who use citations and studies in more casual discussions are disingenuous in how they go about it they dont do deep dives into these studies and really analyze them properly usually they just look for something on google and spam the link in reality it takes hours and hours of labor to actually properly understand a study and nobody is actually going to do this in a casual discussion not the people who are providing the citation nor the people who are being provided to 3 its just not persuasive when it comes to more casual discussions throwing a bunch of links at people is never going to actually change anyones view or genuinely persuade someone logic rhetoric personal experience etc are much more persuasive its fine if you want to incorporate some statistics into your argument but you need the other things to actually get through to people simply saying ahkshually this study says serves no purpose other than an attempt to one up somebody and likely annoy them theres a reason why most politicians dont just get in front of a podium and give voters a reading list of academic peer reviewed studies 4 its just boring a discussion that devolves into a google search contest isnt engaging or interesting,human

320,we should not be blaming tems for obscuring peoples views at the oscars with her dresssocial media was crazy this morning blaming tems for her huge dress which may have blocked the views of people behind her and people are being really aggressive about it on reddit and twitter this aggression in my opinion is unfounded whats more i think it is premature to blame her at all heres my reasoning1 if she was given the design beforehand there is no reason to assume that she knew better this is her first year being well known whereas previously she was an unknown musician from africa i dont know anyone who has ever worn a dress that has a collar higher than their head its not exactly a common thing so would the average person be able to immediately see from a design that that would be obstructing someones view hard to say especially if you are not used to wearing performative pieces and going to events like that if you were exceptionally tall or usually wear hats then maybe you would think of it but as it stands i have yet to be convinced that the average person would anticipate this2 once she got the dress if she noticed it was too large that would have been too late for the most part actresses do not wear dresses that they own to the oscars they sign a contract with a designer to showcase a dress often these dresses cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make so at that point she couldnt have just not worn it and could even have been sued for doing so 3 lastly some people have commented online that tems should have pushed the dress down or changed seats you dont know if either of those were actual options changing seats probably would have been impossible for an event like that and pushing the dress down could have damaged it plus its not even clear that the people behind her even mentioned to her that they could not see that is just pure speculation at this point,human
321,tiktok is more detrimental than beneficial to nursing as a wholetiktok has since its inception been more detrimental to nursing as a career than helpful in my personal opinion i understand that devils advocate will utilize the educational tiktoks but other platforms are more helpful in education youtube as they offer more time to go in depth over concepts the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits as someone whos spent over a decade trying to advocate nursing as a career seeing those in overly tight scrubs acting dramatic doing dances ect seems more like a desperate cry for attention than wayward nurses trying to connect influencer culture as a whole is toxic and gives adults and children completely unrealistic outlooks on whats acceptable and unacceptable in and out of the workplace its profoundly challenging to tell society respect me for my mind then a new grad doesnt wear underwear while twerking on the clock its hard to tell patients to respect us when we act like children talking about icks in ob crying over a patient dying for clout in the icu or making fun of pediatric gsw patients all 3 of these scenarios were nationally and some internationally publicized i really want to know why nurses arent more critical about their colleagues filming tiktoks that damage the career as a whole i think we need to hold ourselves and peers more accountable for societys perspective on us any to those saying theyll judge anyway why actively give and condone more fuel for the fire,human
322,people make too big of a deal about tipping culturei get it youre already spending seven dollars on a coffee but if youre doing that you probably have a dollar or two more to spare however thats not even my main pointso often i hear people saying tipping culture has gotten out of hand i dont agree with capitalism or the way we currently treat service workers and agree that businesses should 100 foot the bill to pay employees a living wage however that is not the system we currently live under and in the real world today most service workers do not make a living wage and rely heavily on tipsheres my thing nobody is making you tip if you dont want to do it dont do it but it irks me when people are antitip but try to spin it into being a workers rights thing no youre not tipping because you believe employers should pay their workers more and you think they deserve a living wage youre not tipping because you simply dont want too thats fine but dont try to make it sound like you are some kind of proworker amazing person when you dont tip a server you are essentially screwing them over in the current system because nobodies rising up to change how restaurants pay them i get it more for other businesses but again nobodies making you tip i think its good that more businesses are offering tip options should it be necessary no but in the system we live under i think its great that theres an option option being the key word for a barista or cashier to make a dollar or two more during a transaction if you feel like it do it if you dont then dont but when people just outright dismiss tipping as a whole it makes me think you just dont want to feel guilty for not doing it and you put that higher than the positives it can bring for the worker i think its good in todays system for there to be an option for people to make a little more money,human
323,progressives and lgbt people are just as fanatical and dogmatic as evangelicals and conservativesmuch of the debateculture war on reddit and elsewhere seems to be between prolgbt progressives and evangelical christian conservatives however it seems to me that many progressives claim to be ideologically neutral and base their beliefs on science but science only tells us facts about how biology and chemistry function science doesnt tell us how to think or feel about anything ive got the argument several times that i ought to be an lgbt ally because science science doesnt dictate what political causes or ideology i supporti keep mentioning lgbt because it seems that if youre not religious nowadays then your sexuality and gender identity that defines you why why is that so important isnt that arbitrarily dogmaticlike isnt the attitude of thou shalt be an affirming ally or thou shalt be prochoice just as dogmatic as an actual religious commandment why do i owe anyone solidarity is there some kind of prolgbt deity i dont know aboutalso if there us no god or deities then why should i have any morals what is right and wrong then arbitrary cultural concepts one nations taboo is another nations normal its not like theres a good or bad afterlife to worry aboutspeaking of afterlife my last point of contention is that modern progressivism is like the secular equivalent of calvinism people who are a part of some oppressed group are among the saved and those who are not allies ought to be damned through social scorn and maybe doxxing their workplace and blacklisting them from finding another job,human
324,both political parties are equally responsible for the division in america and we need more civil conversationi would like to first clarify that i identify as an independent and no before someone else says it i am not just a republican who wants to skip church and smoke weed for me its more about recognizing that we are all multifaceted individuals with unique experiences and opinions that can not be defined by a single wordwe live in a society where disagreement is inevitable it is perfectly normal to have different beliefs values and ideas about the world however it is becoming increasingly common to see people resorting to personal attacks and demonizing those with different opinions and i find that unacceptable this does not foster healthy discussions and debates but instead only fuels division and animosity towards one anotherthere is a great divide in this country it seems as though nearly every post i read on social media creates a narrative about how the other side is evil corrupt and driven by sinister motives it is important to understand everyone has a unique set of experiences that shape their opinions and beliefs the reality is that we are all human beings who believe we are doing what is rightrepublicans call democrats unintelligible socialists who want to destroy america democrats call republicans heartless insurrectionists who want to destroy america it is important to recognize there is a broad spectrum of political ideologies not two groups of people who fit into a stereotype no matter which side you voted for half of the country disagrees i can assure you from my experience as an american half of the country is not evil the truth is that we all are just people people who care about our family friends neighbors and countryeven when we disagree with one another it does not make the other side bad people we need to show civility in our approach to changing the perspectives of others even to the people who hold views we find abhorrent vilifying people who hold different opinions only serves to further entrench our differences and diminish our opportunities to solve problemsthere is no onesizefitsall solution to the complex problems we have in this country having civil conversations is the only way to gain a better understanding of each others perspectives it allows us to explore the nuance of these issues find common ground and identify where compromise is possible when our beliefs are being attacked it is easy to become frustrated and angry but a willingness to learn with an open mind may help us realize that our disagreements are not as irreconcilable as we first thought we may have more in common than we realizelet me end with this when was the last time you had a civil conversation with someone you disagreed with when was the last time you listened to what they had to say rather than just waiting for your turn to speak for many of us i suspect it has been a while not everyone will be willing to hear you out but we should still strive to engage in productive conversations that promote understanding and mutual respectits important to clarify that my intention is not to promote tolerance towards racism homophobia misogyny or xenophobia rather i believe that we should work towards changing these harmful perspectives but do so in a way that does not involve attacking or demonizing individuals who hold these views the civil rights movement womens suffrage and rights movements 1920s labor movement and lgbtq rights movement all found some success through peaceful protest and conversations people can change their minds but only if you allow them an opportunity to,human
325,i think that the existence of closed spaces exclusively for people of a marginalized identity is not inherently a bad thingthere is this ongoing discourse about the existence of closed spaces for members of specific marginalized communities and a lot of progressives will say this is selfsegregation or regressive let me say that i know there are people who because of trauma or past experiences or honestly because sometimes people are just shitty are way too eager to turn the tables and exclude the people groups who previously excluded them and i agree that insofar as that is the motivation it is not something i supporthowever there are plenty of legitimate reasons why marginalized people would want to have spaces primarily or even exclusively designed to cater to their needs and shared experiences because the wider world is still not safe for them people from more mainstream identities read cishet and white may get legitimately upset by feeling excluded exclusion is an ugly feeling but they inhabit a world that is mostly built to cater to their needs and shared experiences so its not like they dont have anywhere else to belong plus a lot of times these spaces will welcome people outside their ingroup so long as the guests dont take up too much physical or emotional space in them maybe the most i am willing to sympathize with their perspective is that closed spaces not be intentionally hurtful when establishing and protecting boundariesi think a lot of the discomfort from mostly white cishet progressives is that they are afraid that bigots could use similar rationalizations to try to reestablish whitesonly or straightsonly spaces or whatever but truth is1 these things already exist how many black people do you see at country clubs or how many gay people can be themselves openly at evangelical churches and2 marginalizing someone because of their identity is not the same as having a space that caters to people who share a common experience of marginalization,human

327,humanity doomed itself the moment it accepted slavery as a viable conceptits my opinion that humanity is doomed to fail at some point if you look at it as a game we lost the moment we decided slavery was okay in any form but especially in a systemic form there are ways to achieve and construct things by treating people fairly and not using others as machines or animals slavery showed humans darkest instincts and behaviors these things are clearly still in us and its why we wont ever conserve this planet to our benefit or even escape it to another racism is just one issue but its more about the lack of trust we have in each other the damage caused by slavery is still felt today and it becomes part of our identity because these instincts somehow still live in us we would have to permanently transcend our darkest impulses to ascend to a sustainable existence of peace and trust but when trust is broken it can often never be rebuilt,human

329,it doesnt matter which economic or political system we use to try to manage humanity and civilisation so long as there are humans involved we will corrupt itthere is no such thing as a perfect or likely even near perfect system for the governance of human populations which is directly managed by humans that doesnt become significantly corrupt over time i have had many arguments with people who believe that communism would be a better system for managing large populations but what these people never seem to take into account is that so long as it is a system managed by humans it will inherently lean towards corruption to one degree or another i believe the best system we can create is one that manages to dissipate the negative impacts of centralised power thus creating a society that leans towards corruption as little as possible while also recognising that regardless of what system we implement this tendency will always be there so long as the system is run by humans case in point i feel like democracy and capitalism do a reasonably good job of achieving this it distributes elective power to the people while also distributing economic power through free markets yet what we see happening now is the corruption of this system due to the consolidation of political choice due to very limited party choices in most western countries along with economic consolidation caused by corporatism which is rapidly taking over capitalism i believe a possible if highly risky solution to this is to allow highly intelligent ai to manage our political and economic systems as this takes humans mostly out of the question but of course which humans program the ai and give it its aims and goals then becomes the issue yet this solution i believe still has the best possibility of helping humans to thrive as a species,human
330,being transgender doesnt make any senseits not rooted in reality for you to change gender from man to woman you must have some kind of what man and woman are if man and woman isnt measured by the biological markers then how are you measuring it what exactly are you transitioning into if you cant accurately describe what a man or a woman is by a set of fundamental characters and attributes whats even the point of identifying as a man or a woman if there is no distinct differences between the two are they the same thing if no then how would you describe either man or womanif youre gay lets say a man youre attracted to men not woman and vice versa for lesbians and if youre straight youre attracted to the opposite sex is this true if so there must be a difference between man and woman that is measurable so i believe you are either one or the other and you cant truly change that change my veiw thankyou i am open and willing to learn dispute how you have probably already judged me,human

333,being popular in high school  college is actually importantsometimes i hear people saying stuff like high school  college popularity doesnt matter in the real world i honestly think this is copium from people who werent popular obviously there are some people who peaked in high school or college and others who were losers that end up becoming successful later in life however generally speaking being popular is an important part of development and learning and you are missing out if you werent one of the popular kids first of all generally speaking popularity comes from having good traits such as being attractive having good social skills having a good personality being good at sports being funny whatever being popular in high school and college is like the equivalent of smart kids getting good grades its a reward for doing well in certain areas second of all being popular is an important part of development you honestly learn a lot by having a ton of friends and an active social life when you are younger it helps you develop even better social skills which will continue to help you out later on in life the earlier you start developing these skills the better and more experienced you will be going forward third its helpful to start building a social circle and network of people you know early on in life even though you will drift apart with people over the years it still provides a good foundation if you get the ball rolling early the more people you know the easier it becomes to meet new people its like a snowball effect you start off by being popular in high school and college and you will continue meeting more new people and making new connections than you would have otherwise even if you end up with completely different friend groups later on it all traces back to having a lot of friends early on plus in many cases friends you made back in high school and college often become lifelong friends fourth it just makes those years more fun in general high school and college are some of the easiest places to make friends and its at a time in life where you most likely arent a parent yet and most of the people you know arent parents yet this is a great time to just have fun and enjoy it later on in life people usually become busier less available plus more worn down in general overall im sick of hearing some people pretend that popularity in high school  college isnt important obviously grades are important too but popularity is just as if not more important than getting good grades as long as your grades are decent enough youre good getting a 40 but not having a social life isnt that great getting like a 34 or something but actually having a big social life is a much more valuable academic experience,human

339,politicians the news media and even social media mods do not do enough to remind people that dislikinghating a foreign government should not be applied to citizens of those nationsi am chinese i came here when i was two and grew up in this country i went to school here i work here i pay my taxes i do my part as a human of this planet to give back to charities and organizations that better the community the world and the earthwhat i am currently seeing by way of political rhetoric is that china is bad and i recognize the us and china have had economic competition for decades but it seems now things are more tense than ever i see it both from the left and the right on reddit i often see fuck china this and fuck china that  even for nonpolitical posts its pretty intense   given the political climate and angry rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum along with some of the shit i have seen on reddit it has created some level of anxiety in me  both for traveling purposes and just being more apprehensive about acknowledging a part of me that is outside my control i guess we generally use fuck country colloquially to mean fuck that countrys govt but now it seems that phrase has expanded to create a suspicion and hatred towards asiansive travelled to different parts of the country and in predominantly white states i get stares but i have not explicitly experienced any racism or prejudice  so far that being said i am a bit more apprehensive and cautious more than ever about traveling to certain parts of this country due to the rise of asians being targeted with assault etc so its definitely happeningid like to think most americans can separate hatred of the chinese govt from chinese citizens or chinese people living in this country but i am not always confident in american exceptionalism due to some of the angry rhetoric i have seen in the news and media culturally i am assimilated into the american experience with minimal exposure even to my own background but no matter what i say or do i ultimately have no control over my physical ethnic traits and how strangers might perceive me based on their own political viewsi fear that the lack of constant reminders from the news politicians social media platforms means more people will blur the line or end up holding irrational prejudices against chinese people  especially in america where people sometimes struggle with separating personal political values from an individual  sometimes even deliberately targeting asians due to ones own political views even if one does not personally hate chinese people using language like fuck china seemingly only risks potentially extending that hatred beyond politics we have seen this quite a bit with members of other minority groups since east asians are distinctly and noticeably different compared to caucasians it is not easy to simply blend ini suppose hating the ccp isnt anything new and there are many reasons to not like the ccp but with the rise of media coverage on asian people being targeted and politicians not seemingly doing enough to remind people to separate govt from the people there seems to be an immediate negative reaction when people drop the word china and often people can find it difficult to separate hating china the govt from hating china the peoplemy take is that both the left and right politicians are not doing enough to remind people to adopt rhetoric that might be more appropriate such as expressing hatred towards a political part instead of a country saying fuck china and fuck the chinese seemingly encompasses the people the culture the good vs fuck the chinese govt or fuck the ccp fuck xi which makes it far more clear that ones discontent is not with the people but rather only with the governmentpoliticians and the news media can do more to help change the rhetoric and remind all of us to separate politics from the people we all say we know it but it doesnt seem to be emphasized enough i believe we should adopt an approach with the way we use our language that minimizes risks of people letting their political views against a government transfer to become prejudice or even racism against someone who might be from a certain country not just for china but with iran with russia or any state that we have deemed to be antithetical to americas valuessome may argue free speech but id challenge these people if we can be more precise in our language if it means it can minimize potential fueling of hatred and racism etc   thanks for reading,human
340,i think im smarter than i really am all i do is just write halfway decent and thats maybe too much creditthis might be a bit of an odd change my view but its something that ive been wondering about and struggling with for this cmv ill refer to conversations on reddit since this is what got me thinkingwhen it comes to expressing my opinions or ideas i often find myself on the receiving end of a negative reaction whether itd be in real life or on the internet and often times i find it rather strange because many times i agree with the person im talking to and describe why i do as such but then im still told that im wrong or on reddit continue to get downvoted even with a minor disagreement ive seen more incendiary takes that still get good amounts of support and positive feedback but i often get drilled for expressing what i think is pretty much the same opinion with maybe some trivial differencesafter thinking about it i think this is because subconsciously i probably think im smarter than i really am i use that i think best conveys my thoughts and opinions but in all honesty its probably just a way to sound intelligent when making a dumb thought or opinion i dont do this consciously its just the way i write or speak but it seems that no one understands what im trying to say and instead try to tell me what i really think  so often times i wonder what is the source of the disagreement because we agree with pretty much everything maybe just a minor point on reddit why does this person continue to downvote me and continues on points that i didnt even bring up ill reread over and over again what i had said and if i was being understood but in recent discussions on cmv it seems that even after going through my comments and seeing that i did indeed tried to explain my view in the best way i could possible ill still get downvoted even when im 99 agreeing with the other person ultimately i think this is because im writing im writing in a way that i think is both intelligent and understandable but really im just not that smart but i was trained to use big words and expressions yet cant connect them into coherent ideasmaybe i just need to stick to shorter sentences and paragraphs that are my level to being understood by othersso lets see if you can change my view,human
341,we need a wealth capits become apparent that the rampant social experiment known as freedom of wealth has failed the majority of us and is being used as a carrot to lead us by the nose by setting limits on this it opens up what has been gated from most of society when the land may not be monopolized by some oligarch we should be able to distribute it effectively without being forced to live in these compounds called towns and citiesby setting a 5 million cap on individuals as a well as lets say three houses and three carsvehiclesexcess wealth will be used to renew our societyif we limit wealth we limit greed,human
342,you do not need any excuse to break up with someonei often hear people mad at their exes for suddenly or apparently randomly leaving this makes no sense to meyou are not inherently indebted to anyone else you can leave whoever you want end whatever relationship for no any whatsoever members of a relationship are two separate people with the separate rights to bodily autonomy you also cant control emotions if someone simply falls out of love with you would you rather them stay in the relationship and pretend for your sakebeing dumped sucks but would you rather be with someone who doesnt want to be with you no so you cannot reasonably be upset with someone for leaving you,human
343,people should use headlights on rainy  stormy days even in daytime people who dont are selfish jerksthis is a view on something that seems like common sense to me however a lot of people in my area dont do it so im wondering if maybe my view is flawedyou should use headlights when driving on rainy  stormy days i see people driving gray cars the blend into the roadrain with no headlights and im like what are you thinking it literally involves a flick of the finger extremely minimal effortnot only that but its the law in my state  california vehicle code 24400 you must turn on your headlights if snow rain fog dust or low visibility 1000 feet or less requires the use of windshield wiperssince all my logic and the law says to do it i can only conclude the people who dont are selfish lazy jerks but maybe im missing something,human
344,i consider christians to be frauds if they havent read through the bible at least once throughout their lifeive recently started reading the bible usually to fall asleep at night and have made it halfway through genesis whenever converse with christians it seems that many christians have not delved deep into their religious text beyond simply reading scripture during bible study i am an agnostic so im still exploring my own beliefs but even if i were to believe in god i dont think it would necessarily align with the christian conception of a deity another reason i am reading through the bible is that many video games and media entertainment have religious references for example assassin creed odyssey and the god of war series made me more interested in studying greek mythology i started to study christian mythology and have encountered interesting stories like paradise lost and the tower of babel which had created a lot of insightful discussion with experienced christiansthe bible contains material that is fundamental to christian belief and its generally considered important for christians to read the bible at least once in their lifetime many would argue that its a crucial aspect of their faith i estimate the bible to be the length of about two harry potter novels and many people in the world have read the harry potter series anyways if they truly have faith in a deity then why wouldnt they invest the time on learning about such deity it doesnt make sense to me,human

349,people shouldnt care so much about their gender identityfor the record im not only referring to trans and nonbinary people im also talking about for example men who are super obsessed with being manly who make being a man such a huge part of their personal identity being this obsessed with gender is honestly just cringe whether you are trans nonbinary or cis the idea of revolving your personality around gender identity is just kind of ridiculous it really doesnt matter and its a silly thing to revolve your personality around the way i see it it doesnt really matter whether you are a male or a female or a man or a woman or whatever at least when it comes to your identity as a person if i magically woke up tomorrow having the body of the opposite sex i honestly wouldnt give a shit i wouldnt complain about how im trapped in the wrong body or whatever id just carry on as normal obviously people do get treated differently and have different experiences based on their sex andor gender but at the end of the day there are way more similarities than there are differences we still eat the same food we live in the same cities we have access to all the same hobbies and interests etc its like when you play an rpg maybe there might be a few quests that are different for different classes but 90 of the game is still the same either way for the record im specifically referring to 21stcentury western countries the differing experiences between sexes and genders arent enough to justify revolving your personality or identity around it,human

351,hetero women have just as unrealistic standards of romance as men dothere have been many discussions and studies done on how men are affected by porn consumption from sex addiction to mirroring problematic behaviors to normalizing aggressive sex while i think the situation is not completely similar i find it interesting how little i see women examine their biases and expectations when it comes to datingtheres no problem with preferences of course but when there are increasing concerns of low birth rates low marriage rates and young people having less sex than ever i think both sides should be critical about whether what they want is reasonable to expect im sure there are plenty of women who want completely doable things in their relationships but how many women unknowingly are ruining their romantic lives trying to live up to some idealized version of romance that doesnt exist outside of fiction especially when you consider the onus is still primarily on men to engage and push romantic relationships forward its just exhausting to constantly be trying to gauge what the person sees as romantic or what they want out of a partner when i know the standards are so skewed towards perfect men who are charming confident assertive and masculine in all the right ways while perfectly avoiding any and all red flags that simply come from living in a patriarchy and of course the women in question are free to ghost and ignore anyone not to their standards inadvertently making the problem worse as they continually reduce their dating pools looking for a perfect man that doesnt exist even lesbians have noted how difficult it is to date women for presumably similar reasonsthis is by no means a woman hating post nor is it an excuse for men to be emotionally unintelligent or manipulative but i genuinely feel theres a huge gap in expectations that ruins many relationships men do you find this to be true in your circlesrelationships women do you feel your standards have been unknowingly shifted due to all the romance media we have created are women aware of how exhausting it is to be a man trying to live up to these reasonable standards,human
352,there is no argument that sufficiently overrides a students rights explaining why a studentin the usa must recite the pledge of allegianceim going to start by addressing some of the primary arguments for it1 its to honor people who died for you your countrythe students in no way likely compelled or asked said peoplesoldiers to die or fight in a war additionally most wars in modern history fought by the us have not been fought for the sovereignty or preservation of the usa as a country but rather for political gain and posturing compounding this the student in questionassuming they are a k11 has no ability to directly change political policy or if a war is fought or not lastly the person in question could have easily have been born anywhere else and did not willingly decide to be born in a specific country or location2 its respectfulit is inherently disrespectful to mandate that a student say any set of words or phrases against their will especially if they are of a different religion and do not agree with the under god part of the pledge of allegiance to further back this claim the pledge of allegiance is allegedly a symbol of american valuespolicies like freedom and the constitution given that the constitution contains the first amendment its disrespectful and mocking to the student to utilize such a symbol as a method of depriving said student of the rights said symbol representslastly punishing students for not reciting it is essentially punishing a thought crime,human
353,nurture has a much bigger effect on people than nature on all aspects of lifethis has been a topic of interest for a very long time amp have been researching it for a while when i say research i mean watching documentaries on serial killers upbringing listening to neural scientists amp psychologists speak about their experienceopinions on this topic and reading articlesto be clear this topic is heavily debated in psychologyneural science however it seems that the more modern the studies are the more it points to environment being the biggest factor explains why almost every serial killer if not all has had a very troubled past even ones that people used to believe had a normal upbringing like jeffery dahmer turns out after looking into what he claimed was normal was actually twisted explains why criminals of all degrees were usually forced into their life due to environmental factors such as povertyexplains why in american style prisons the return rate is 76 while in denmark where they have much different prison environments the return rate overall is only 27 amp in open prisons the return rate is 19 denmark figured out that if you treat people like humansgive help while in prison amp more importantly out of prison then those people are much less likely to commit crimes explains why when there was a case of identical triplets being separated at birth documentary is called three identical strangers even though they were all genetically identical raised in the same countrystate which is a big deal actually they all came out very different i mean people were really trying to force them to seem alike amp even then it was clear how different they were personality wise one of the brothers specifically was so damaged from his past that he ended up committing suicide explains why depending on the country you were born in that your iq varies i mean it varies by a lot even just a 15 point different in iq is huge yet as it turns out countries with iq average above 95 are mostly wealthier nations compared to the world while countries that are very poor rank low in iq many in the low 80mid 70 iq range amp a fair amount in the 60 range some countries like nepal and couple others were in the 40 iq range source httpswisevotercomcountryrankingsaverageiqbycountryplease include this specific point when providing a counter argumentalso something that has to be explained if the belief that genetics plays a bigger role than environment that something is the iq gap not only in poorer countries but minorities in america vs white people there is a significant iq gap between the average black american vs a white american if the the belief that genetics plays a bigger part than environment then by default the explanation for iq gaps are due to genetics therefore you would also have to say that minorities are less intelligent than white people genetically with the big racial discrimination implications aside i find that explanation hard to believe because even asian countries like nepal scored very very low on iq tests as well as african middle eastern and so on what those countries amp the minorities in america have in common is their wealth aka environment not geneticssource httpswwwbrookingseduarticlestheblackwhitetestscoregapwhyitpersistsandwhatcanbedoneampso again i believe that the environment plays the biggest factor in peoples outcomes compared to their genetics however i am always challenging my views amp am interested to hear why you may believe the opposite,human

363,morality is overratedfirst i will clarify that everyone ought to have certain baseline levels of morality obviously you should treat people with respect dont do anything that directly harms anyone and generally be courteous and mindful of other people what i am talking about is more superficial things that people use to moral grandstand things like not consuming certain products for ethical reasons being selfrighteous about certain political views and antagonizing anyone who disagrees with you being on a high horse about your religion flexing about how your career choice is noble or virtuous letting everyone know about your volunteer work or donating to charity im sorry but being selfrighteous about these types of things is one of the most obnoxious traits someone can havelife is short there is nothing wrong with only worrying about anyone other than yourself your family and your friends oh the dairy industry is bad for the environment and animals are mistreated so what burgers taste good the ip creator of this video game has socially unacceptable opinions who cares the game is fun your friend said some ignorant stuff while drunk who cares they are fun to hang out with theres a new protest about the new flavor of the month issue dont care id rather just watch netflix with my partner new volunteer opportunities available dont care im too lazy career choice contributes little to society and exploits workers whatever the pay is good did a new charity just open up oh well im gonna spend my money on fun stuff instead the point is that there is nothing wrong with just living your life doing stuff you enjoy and not caring so much about trying to help fix society if you want to be a progressive political activist who volunteers during your free time while avoiding unethical products thats fine you do you but thats not going to win you any brownie points especially if you are flexing about it all the time its also not a valid excuse to be judgmental or aggressive to people who disagree with you or are more on the apathetic side just live and let live,human

366,pee is stored in the ballspee is stored in the balls because of the intricate network of tubes that connect the urinary tract to the testicles these tubes known as the pee ducts are responsible for transporting urine from the bladder to the testicles where it is stored until it is ready to be expelledthe testicles themselves play a crucial role in the process of urine storage as the urine flows into the testicles it is filtered and purified by the testicular tissue this process removes impurities and ensures that the urine is of the highest possible qualityonce the urine has been purified it is stored in the testicles until the body is ready to expel it at this point the urine is expelled from the testicles and flows through the pee ducts back to the bladder where it can be eliminated from the bodywhile this may seem like an unusual process it is actually quite common in the animal kingdom many animals including dogs cats and horses store urine in similar ways the human body has simply evolved to adapt to this natural process over timein conclusion pee is stored in the balls due to the intricate network of pee ducts and the crucial role that the testicles play in the purification and storage of urine while this may seem strange it is a natural process that has been observed in many other animals as well,human
367,mods who shadowban people on reddit need to be demotedthey are obligated to at least notice the users that their comment is removed shadowbanning comments is such a disgusting behaviour because it literally hides important information from the commenter as to why their comment is removed they really need to stop with that disgusting behaviour that literally tricks users like you know that when you post something and your message gets removed the automod at least notify you but in this case there is no notification at all so mods who implement that disgusting excuse of a shadowban should be demoted and should never be given any mod powers everchange my view,human
368,right to die should be available across the us not just to terminal illnesses but uncurable conditions as wellthe biggest obstacle has been religion which has dominated the narrative pushing agendas such as sanctity of life yet ironically one of the tenants of christianity is preparation for the next life in regard to heaven or hellfor those of us who struggle with conditions that significantly impair our ability to enjoy life this ideal can make life seem more like a prison as someone who has struggled against mental disorders since the beginning this view comes to mind theres no cure for certain conditions such as schizophrenia once the damage has set in and even if you do narrow it out the damage can be too muchdoctors object to this in thinking that wanting to die means you are mentally unwell and are not of sound judgement while this may be true im some cases most solutions provided may not be enough to solve ones own desireif the us would go this route suicide counts would plummet because having the option to die in front of you rather than forcing yourself into a painful escape it may not prevent some but who commit suicide are looking to take control of something and having it within a reasonable grasp would be enough to deter someim not advocating for a culture of kill your self if its too much rather an acceptance that ones life and their decisions are of their own that having the option there can be freeing for those struggling with this pain,human

378,the federal government should not handle social issuesim not taking any stance on any particular social issue for this argument but it is my belief is that things would be much better and much less divided if the federal government handled only economic  and defense issues among others and not social ones such as lgbtq issues and race based issues this does not mean they should ignore discrimination against a particular class but their role should stop at ensuring that the government treats all individuals equally rather than trying to effect things like trans people in sports and rates of employment for particular classes of people for exampleill make two arguments for why i believe this 1 the federal gov can only do so much and has its hands full already without taking on complex issues of race and identity politics we would have better outcomes in the nonsocial areas if the political discussion and elections at the national level avoided focusing on social issuesand2 social change happens much better and faster if it starts locally and then moves to state level with any federal legislation being done only after the issue has been worked out at the more local levelsi will use gay marriage vs trans sports inclusion as examples imagine if in the 90s the congress had passed a law mandating states accept gay marriage there was much less public support at the time so this would have cause states to rebel and challenge this with state laws and supreme court challenges and had it been forced through it likely would have led to a more conservative congress and president being elected in the following cycle who would then overturn the legislation and possibly pass legislation banning gay marriage that would then be harder to overturn the way it happened was a much better outcome than this i am of the opinion that allowing gay marriage is absolutely the right thing to do as treating gay people differently than straight people is unconstitutional and wrong but this is just an example for the purpose of this post and by waiting to pass federal legislation protecting gay marriage until after the public opinion was swayed we got to a better outcome quicker with less change of it being reversedthe trans rights issue is a counter example where the biden admin mandated that trans athletes be allowed to compete as the gender they identify within high school sports i am not taking a position on whether this is the right or wrong policy it is a complex issue but it is beyond the scope of this postwe are now seeing backlash against this and other trans issues and ultimately it seems the pushback is favoring the opposition in popular opinioni believe that this approach will lead to a result that is counter to the result that those who believe it is the right thing would want ie more backlash and more power going to politicians that oppose the rights that those in favor are pushing forampx200bin summary i think forcing social change at the federal level is counterproductive to the goals of said social change and it also distracts the public allowing special interests to essentially sneak by other legislation that very few want that hurts everyone except the very few who want the legislation,human

384,north korea is actually a far right ethnofascist state under the guise of stalinistcommunism not an actual communist state just what  is north korea exactly outsiders have been trying to figure out for many decades just what their deal is how does the kim regime and military elites want their own people to view about themselves and the world and how do they want the outside world to view them their actions dont seem to match their records and their records dont seem to match their actions either its quite bizarre even to south koreansbefore i take on these questions based on my aforementioned view in the posts title i would like to give some background information as to how i got to making this post in the first place and why i think this sort of discussion is desperately needed i am myself quite the history buff and geek ever since my high school years even though i am not and never was a history major in university i just have an innate desire to make sense of the world theres a saying that learning an unbiased and objective history of humankind in all sorts of distant kingdoms empires and hegemonic statesrepublics can help you understand and help you prescribe solutions for the the world in present times well as someone of east asian descent i just wanted to make sense of the crazy tensions between the 3 great powers of the asian sphere the korean peninsula china and japan i especially wanted to know why korea is the way it is now and how it got to be tragically divided in halfmuch like a caged tiger for many decades and just why no one even south koreans themselves seems to really understand the kim regime and its people its kinda like how when you see your neighbor next door trying to arm themselves to the teeth and installing all these military grade security systems in their house in a completely safe neighborhood the first thing that comes to mind would not be how i should stop this guy from being a nut it would instead be on how this guy thinks the same applies for such an isolated country like north korea knowing this can help the world leaders in south korea and the united states on how to best reunify the country with the least amount of misery and deathanyways back to the main point of this post now i share the perspective that korea is actually a hereditary far right national socialist state with korean characteristicstraditions however i just want to provide an overview of the few school of thoughts out there with regard to what north korea actually is and there are 5 to be exact1 the traditional conservative view is that north korea is just merely a stalinistcommunist holdover from the soviet era i understand why a lot of casual viewers of mass media may fall into this perspective because the whole north korean propaganda schtick with the red and sickle symbolisms and leftwing style rhetoric like democratic peoples republic and the masses really does make it seem north korea is like a stalinistcommunist regime actually many south koreans who are just casual watchers of their own mass mediakbs yonhap news sbs etc tend to hold this view2 the neoliberalneoconservative view is that north korea is a state that has just degraded into a rogue state trying to one day in their minds proliferate their nuclear arsenal to the point where they can gain the upper hand over the united states in order to gain the sovereignty that they desire the communist style propaganda the massive military parades and the like are just a means to an end in order to shore up support from north korean citizens over its songun military first policies needed to build more nukes3the leftist and liberal view is that north korea is simply just a continuation of confucian dynastic traditions from way before japanese occupation and that it is neither communist nor fascist their rationale is that all they ever wanted was to be left alone and that had the united states not carpetbombed the hell out of the northern part of the peninsula then the kim regime might have took a milder form of dictatorship akin to post70s north vietnams or east germanys this may seem like the most logical explanation but there is a major flaw to this line of thinking which i will get to after this overview4the permanent bunker fascist state viewmy view not long ago i have stumbled upon and read br myers the cleanest race on north korea actually being an imperial japanese fascist holdover from the 30s and 40s now br myers seems to have no leanings in the academic world of korean history and literature he just simply told it like it was in terms of the order of events starting from the japanese annexation of korea his rationale was this the japanese imperial government stationed in korea at the time deliberately brewed up racebased korean nationalism in order to establish a kinship between koreans and the japanese ironically enough a lot of the intellectuals that helped out with kim il sungs propaganda machine were actually projapanese collaborators who decided to then turn this projapanese korean nationalism into a purely korean version much of the iconography meant to glorify the kim family was actually based on japans own propaganda of venerating emperor hirohito yes i am not making this shit up after reading this really groundbreaking and impartial analysis of north korea ive had severe cognitive dissonancefor a few days as someone who is actually of korean descent the hard hitting and cold truth is that many literate middle and upper class koreans at the time all felt this collective shame for supporting imperial japan upon their defeat in ww2 so they all felt like they wanted to settle the score save face and feel better about themselves as proud koreans out of the 5 perspectives i would say this holds the most weight and validity due to br myers intensive research on what actually happened all those decades ago from koreas liberation to the start of the korean war as a korean i am very much aware that korean history researched by korean academics themselves tend to muddy the waters and to steep itself in nationalism his approach was a way of cutting through all the noise and focus purely on the truth of the chronology of events that had occurred in the peninsula it was certainly quite the plot twist in terms of truly changing what we already had believed to be true about north korea its quite fitting because korean thrillers and mysteries are also filled with plot twists and irony5 finally the bleakest of all perspectives is that north korea is just a straight up hypocritical racketeering mafia state bent on its own survival this perspective is mainly held by independent journalists of various political stripes that mainly try to expose corruption in a lot of 3rd world countrieskleptocracies oligarchies and the like all the propaganda the state is trying to spew to the public and to the outside world are merely political manipulations designed to cover up for the corruption of its military elites much like the 2nd perspective in that it is a rogue state trying to survive only this time it manipulates geopolitics in a way that serves their own monetary interests in underground industries if this is to be true then this is truly a bleak scenario in which the kim regime and its military elites are guaranteed its longevity unless it is overtaken violently by inside or outside forcesnow with all that out of the way i just want to offer my counter arguments to all of them and to offer further supporting arguments to the 4th viewmy view1 contrary to popular belief kim il sung was not socialist in the marxistleninist sense in fact he wasnt really educated or literate about marxistleninist intellectualism himself he dropped out of school entirely when he was 16 or 17 in order to involve himself in resistance movements against the japanese it wasnt until he was picked by the soviets to lead the northern half after making a name for himself as a guerilla fighter against japan he had only implemented the red iconography and leftist style propaganda in order to provide cover for himself so that his administration can start nation building without the soviets butting in the real purpose of his propaganda was purely for fascist racebased reasons which i will get into later when i get to br myers perspective2 its not necessarily true that north korea seeks power or hegemony over united states or that it has the intention of using the nuclear weapons the kim regime unpredictable and irrational as they seem will not actually use a nuke themselves because it knows it would spell the end for their regime if they do3 yes it is true that kim jong un is a rational actor he does indeed care about the survival of his regime its also true that north koreans do want their sovereignty and they do want to be left alone however it is not a confucian state or a continuation of previous korean kingdoms by any means the fascist style propaganda and iconography of the kim family intended to portray motherly figures not fatherly figures which is the basis for an confucian based authoritarian state they are shown to be these really feminine caretaker figures if paintings showing men around the same age laying their heads on kims bosom for comfort and warmth then i dont know what is a more motherly undertone than that if that wasnt prove enough just look at how dozens and dozens of young kids in uniforms rush to feel his embrace every time he goes up to a podium to commence a massive speech4 now onto my view to reiterate from my overview of this perspective projapanese collaborators were hired by none other than kim il sung himself to create his propaganda machine for him koreans during the japanese annexation were actually incentivized to be proud of their own korean race in order for the imperial government to establish a kinship between koreans and japanese a lot of the literate middle and upper class koreans felt this collective shame for supporting japan upon their defeat in ww2 so they would often entrench themselves in these intellectual enclaves to create their own unique forms of pure korean ethnonationalism thereby kicking the japanese out of it much of modern day north korean propaganda comprises of dehumanizing western adversaries mainly united states as these big nosed tainted people conspiring to taint their brethren in the south and to ultimately their own homeland and racial stock this strongly resembles a lot of the iconography depicted in nazi german propaganda whereas they depicted jews as scheming individuals out to taint the german race traditions and sovereignty the difference between north korean fascism and german fascism is that korean fascism is more of an inward kind whereas german fascism was expansionisteg lebensraum the kim familys version of ethnofascism is one where because the korean race is too pure it had been bullied for its kindness and innocence therefore koreans need a motherly figure to look out for them by the way if anyone is arguing that the kims are considered as fatherly leadersgenerals they are not in fact its actually a mistranslation of a lot of western documentaries the word    means mother or relating to motherly characteristics5 now i dont entirely discredit the mafia state theory but i do think money is needed anyway to fund their nuclear operations and to just simply feed themselves by they i mean a lot of the military elites i think that their dealings with underground industries are just a means to an end in order to legitimize their fascist state the reason why i say out of necessity is that they lost much of the aid and revenue after the fall of the soviet empire in the early 90s they simply are just broke as hell and need to find ways to fund their state even if it resorts to dealing with the criminal world by and large i dont think that these dealings are truly corrupting military elitesmaybe some if this racketeering corruption theory were really true then why didnt the kim regime just collapse during the great famines in the 90s surely the military elites and common class soldiers would have to put a bullet on them in rebellion out of desperation for better material well being plus a kleptocratic mafia state implies a materialist mindset which fascism uses does not subscribe to the difference between fascism and communism is really this communism offers improvements in material well being for the masses fascism just straight up offers struggle and strive in both good and bad times in order to strength the sovereignty and purity of their state and race respectivelyi am curious as to what my fellow redittors think is the most accurate perspective on north korea and why the bunker fascist state theory would be wrong,human

386,star voting is superior to instant runoff voting aka ranked choicestar voting is a voting system where you give as many candidates as you want a 05 rating  then  theres a stimulated runoff between the two candidates with the highest average ratings  the candidate who is higher ranked on more ballots is the winnerfor example if you give alice a rating of 5 and bob a rating of 4 you count as a vote for alice in a runoff between alice and bob   if you gave them both a 5 youd count as an obstentionthis is a useful deterrent to certain kinds of strategic voting  for example suppose youre voting in a presidential election and youre trying to maximize the chance of bernie sanders winning  naively the way to do that is to give bernie sanders a 5 and everyone else a 0  however  the problem with that is if the runoff is actually between elizabeth warren and trump youve abstained even though you presumably prefer warren to trump  likewise if the runoff is between warren and biden  biden and kasich or kasich and trump  if you want your vote to count in the runoff voting honestly is a far superior strategy than bullet voting instant runoff voting is a voting system where voters list their first second third etc choices  then if theres not a candidate with an absolute majority of the remaining votes you eliminate the candidate with the lowest vote total and reallocate the votes to their next remaining preferencein irv your second place selection gets no support from you until your first place is eliminated assuming your second place wasnt eliminated first  this means that compromise candidates with a lot of second place support could easily be eliminated early and that election order is very importantinstant runoff has some really weird edge cases because elimination order is very important to the results  for example in the 2009 burlington mayoral election the progressive candidate won   however republicans could have caused the progressive candidate to lose by having the right number of republicans put the progressive as their top choice or by staying homeirv makes it so ka ping yee has an interesting voting system visualizion coloring in a 2d political compass by the color of the candidate who would win if the center of public opinion is within that areahttpzestycavotingsim  most systems produce sensible diagrams but irv produces the oddest looking diagrams with shapes that make no sense  star isnt on there but it shouldnt look too much different from approval an important way to look at voting systems is voter satisfaction efficiencyhttpselectionsciencegithubiovsesimvsebasic a measure of how happy people are with the results  irv is slightly better than plurality but significantly worse than approval voting star or 321,human
387,religion was created by humans to make sense of the unknown and unexplainablei admit i havent delved deeply into the bible but i question the reasoning behind the spread of christianity why didnt god send divine messengers like jesus to other societies and cultures especially given the diverse religious beliefs and practices across different cultures the coexistence of different religions has led me to wonder whether christianity is a human inventionwhy did god choose to establish a foothold in israel instead of china or japan as far as i understand religion was one of the earliest means by which societies came together as communities to achieve common goals it served as a way to facilitate community growth and developmenti wonder if there were highly intelligent individuals who recognized the potential of religion as a tool for community development and capitalized on it to bring people together in the past,human
388,most feminist groups only care about mens problems if they affect womentldr mainstream groups that aim for gender equality are useless at addressing issues that mostly affect men because they only really care about womenusually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women eg college enrollment rates suicide homelessness loneliness and say that efforts should be made to address them the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups id argue that feminist groups shouldnt be left to solve themit seems to me that most feminist groups only care about mens issues if they affect women recently i saw this article linkedhttpswwwharpersbazaarcomculturefeaturesa27259689toxicmasculinitymalefriendshipsemotionallabormenrelyonwomen and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely the article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated that these men are miserable is an afterthoughtsimilarly boys who start to be exposed to andrew tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that theyre lonely and miserable is ignored usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that theyre more likely to struggle with student debtit seems that if men would only be miserable lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women these groups would be perfectly happy so i dont trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected,human

392,as a trans woman i believe that the mainstream feminist movement doesnt have our core interests at heart and i no longer call myself a feminist as a resultfor context ive been transitioned and living as a trans woman for almost 7 years basically my entire adult life minus around 6 months or so so im not new to womanhood as ive experienced iti was raised in a liberal household with a strong mom who rose to a very high level in her company and i respect her for it ive always been pro life pro womens rights and have a desire to dismantlereform the systems that oppress all women and other minorities alikebut at the same time to me its become painfully obvious that mainstream feminism has a lot of limitations when it comes to representing all its members especially trans women like mein my view to this day mainstream feminism was created by and for cis women and is mainly made up of cis women this isnt bad in of itself as mass movements can often achieve a lot of pressure for change just by existing but sometimes can lead to awkward situations from the overwhelming cisgender nature of thingsthe pussy hats at the 2016 womens march were a prime example as i felt like the body part reductionist message there left me feeling what place at all i had there why bother showing up when my mental health would become a net negative due to the glaring reminders of what i dont have that also marked womanhood and solidarity in that specific time and placethat kind of stuff combined with feminist cis women who are either apathetic towards or actively opposed to trans people like me has made me care a lot more about my own trans community than their feminist one should i bother to change how i see this or continue to stick with advocacy within my own community,human
393,financial incentives will not solve decreasing birth ratesa common reason i hear for decreasing birth rates is that people can no longer afford it due to increased cost of living i disagree i believe the main reason birth rates are decreasing is because people are simply not interested in having childrenmany countries have tried providing financial incentives to increase birth rates china japan south korea germany denmark finland etc all of their birth rates are projected to continue decreasing even countries with the most generous child care subsidies like the denmark and luxembourg have below replacement fertility rates if even the nordic countries which subsidize child care high quality public education college expenses and healthcare reducing the financial burden of raising a child cannot bring their fertility rates above replacement level it suggests that financial incentives are not enough to meaningfully increase birth ratesi believe the biggest reason for the decrease in birth rates is because more and more people dont see children as necessary to having a meaningful life its no coincidence birth rates decrease as a country develops more people especially women are able to be educated and find careersafford pastimes that provide them a sense of fulfillment this would explain why people with higher incomeseducation have less children there are more options to lifesocietal values have shifted back when women were discouraged from pursuing higher education and professional careers a lot of them followed societal expectations of women are supposed to be mothers now that the societal pressure has decreased its only natural that less women choose to follow the traditional lifestyle that was once pushed onto them we see women are having children at later age and having less children overallchildren are a lot of work even if you paid me to be a parent i wouldnt be interested because it is a huge time commitment it can be emotionally taxing and can sometimes require sacrifices in our personal goalsthere was an interesting observation made on chinese social media the post stated that for a long time men never understood how difficult parenting can be since they dumped all the heavy lifting of childrearing onto their wives now that women have more opportunities in life the father has a greater role in childrearing and many chinese fathers are realizing it was much harder than they initially thoughtafter you finish your 95 job for the day the second shift begins tantrums in the early years worrying about your childs academic performance making sure your child has good values and stays out of trouble requires a lot of quality time considering all the implications parenting has on your career the decrease in free time for yourself the emotional toll of seeing your child go through hard times im not surprised more people are choosing to embrace other lifestyles like dink being a disney adult or raising a pet,human

398,conservative trans people exist one of the real tragedies of contemporary politics is that our most bitter disagreements are about something that doesnt even existthe political spectrum left and right are entirely tribal designations and have no unifying philosophy or principle behind them that can be represented on a unidimensional spectrumthis may sound like an absurd claim but before rejecting out of hand consider that the political spectrum rests on an essentialist theory of ideology that has been soundly falsified the essentialist theory says that although it may seem that there are many distinct political issues in politics there is actually just one big issuean underlying essence that ties them all together eg change vs preservation equality vs freedom order vs liberty realism vs idealism etc if politics is unidimensional about one essential issue then a unidimensional political spectrum is adequate to represent politics the common retort of many essentialists is that conservatives or liberals who switch their positions so easily arent true conservatives or true liberals but in this the essentialists are falling prey to the private language fallacythe erroneous belief that a private individual can arbitrarily determine the meaning of public words the thousands of fox newswatching bushvoting limbaughlistening cpacsupporting people in these studies call themselves conservatives the media calls them conservatives and the politicians they support are coded as conservative in ideological voting measures they are therefore real conservatives in the only sense that its possible to be a real conservative because there is no transcendent definition of ideology beyond the tribe those who compose the liberal and conservative tribes are by definition true liberals and conservatives those who insist otherwise might be falling prey to motivated reasoningseeking to justify their own ideology by appealing to principlei understand why so many of us want to believe in the political spectrumit makes politics simple and gives us the illusion that our partys beliefs have an underlying and righteous philosophical coherencebut its time to face up to the facts rightwing and leftwing are little more than tribal designations shedding our jerseys might help us become more rational more humble less tribal and ultimately more openminded when it comes to public issues,human

uclahttpslawuclaedueventsabolitionlegalfielddiscussionaboutabolitionismclassroomandbeyond note these examples vary in approach my argument will not be focused on these contents paradigm as a personal anecdote having attend various legal panels and seminars hosted on law school campuses abolitionism seems to be more trending now more than everthis is not to say there are not issues with the current criminal law system and certain laws for example three strikes law still exists in california there are many good arguments against it but that point also envelops the solution the law is constantly changing and its amenable nature makes it imperative to work within its system to progress change rather than deconstruct it entirelyi have had plenty of debate with abolitionists from formal to informal settings who have focused on various issues ie racial disparities or the private prison complex to justify total abolitionism while these concerns have merit for discussion these do not warrant the total abolitionist ideology instead i see these abolitionists as highly opinionated and critical of the correctional system but i do not believe any total abolitionist believes what they are claimingthe total abolitionist perspective i am arguing against abolition rejects the expansion of all aspects of the prison industrial complexhttpcorrectionsprojectcomwordpressportfolioprisonmapsjpcarousel644 this means eliminating prisons and police as well as removing policing from society i do not believe any abolitionist truly believes in eliminating prisons outside of it being a talking point i am open to having my mind changed as i truly want to be convince of at least one reasonable argument but i have yet to discover an argument consistent with viable solutions and incorporate enough nuance that merits any legitimate considerations for my mind to be changed id love all three premises to be reasonably challenged in the context of california department of corrections and rehabilitationcontexti am aware of people having tough times and making difficult life decisions  mistakes and the importance for rehabilitation thanks to the correctional system they gain vocational skills college educations and much needed selfhelp trainings and programming ie calpia to reenter society another underrated aspect is developing suitable parole plans once they get out where will they stay do they have a support network will they have work to sustain themselves will they be in the best position possible to not revert to criminal behavior these are all services that my state provides to the inmate these are measures so a former criminal who committed lewd and lascivious acts against a child do not get tempted when they see a child on the street someone who murdered someone for rejecting him develops the selfcontrol needed to not do it againpremisesi believe abolitionists specifically in california who are against the correctional system are very uneducated on the subject in fact i truly believe they dont believe what they are arguing the main premises for my position1 regarding total abolitionists  those who believe in fully abolishing the prison system  do not have viable nor practicable solutions for malicious crimesthe premise explains itself someone murders twelve kids how does an abolitionist suppose we deal with them2 the argument that criminal punishment should only focus on rehabilitation rather than be punitive unjustifiably undercut theories of retributionwhy should your perfect world views take precedent over hurting victims and their families who want to feel relief and justice if it was my wife badly beaten and assaulted i would want them to receive punishment you would the same if someone kidnapped assaulted and murdered your nephews and nieces why do your outside feelings take precedent over those directly impacted3 our current system and improving this system is the best way to rehabilitate inmatesits hard to see how or why an abolitionist would disagree with cdcrs approach rehabilitating and reducing recidivism is exactly what states have been doing through proper programming a total abolitionist view seems more argumentative than substantiveid include that in my state we are accommodating inmates more than than necessary  in fact we even allowed inmates to create their own podcasts distributed throughout prison radios the state provides inmates commissary catalogues allowing them to buy nike shoes watches etcconclusioni think i made my points clear tldr total abolitionism  eliminating the prison system as a whole is more argumentative than substantive it 1 does not provide practicable nor viable solutions for malicious crimes 2 rehabilitation gt punishment does not fit the script for every crime and is unfair to victim families and 3 our current system and improving it is the best balance between punishment and rehabilitation and the best way to rehabilitate inmates already withstanding these three premises it is impossible for someone to truly believe in total abolitionism,human
410,west started the new cold warrussia changed a lot after soviet collapse as a matter of fact russia tried to change itself from the very moment when mikhail gorbachev became gensek in 1985 and kept trying till 2002 someone could say 2004 but lets keep it low in order to join the european union or however to find a common language with the west eu usa take your pick and then it said wtfgorbachev asked to join eu before 1991 he had done already or was going to do a lot he had brought the boys back home from afghanistan he let the germans tear down the berlin wall he promoted glasnost and perestroyka at home in a quite voluntaristic and even a bit unthoughtful way talking with hindsight but anyway but eu say no the rationale was more or less the same you say now you are too big no pun intendedthen they drove the old ussr down and all the bells were singing for a while russia went through what we all know but few of us can really imagine the life expectancy for men fell from 64 years in 1990 to 59 in 2000 nuff said the local liberals whored out the same names and concepts of liberalism and democracy do you know what derhmocracy means well remember cambronne in order to change russia and join the west and then there was putin but even putin tried to join eu after all russia was smaller than ussr but it was too big yet for brusselsmeanwhile with a decision that the great american diplomat george kennan the father of antisoviet containment so a man beyond any suspect criticized to death its the beginning of a new cold war he said the clintonian usa had supported euphemism the first enlargement of nato till the former soviet borders and stuffed eu with proamerican and antirussian proxies through the action of uk of course a real us troyan horse in the eu as de gaulle had forecastedso the attempts of russia and of the old europeans to find a common language between russia and eu let alone to start the path toward an association of russia if not a full blown membership became even harder not to say impossible and mostly not for russian responsibility yes there was the second chechen war but when eltsin started the first without a provocation as the basayevs attack to dagestan august 1999 clinton praised him comparing him to lincoln so what are we talking aboutand then there was september 11 or as i prefer to call it the sequel of rambo 3 the russians had warned usa for years about the danger the radical islamist groups they had created funded armed trained or alltheabovetogether could create to them too and even offered their cooperation to contrast them but proud usa always loftily dismissed this proposal and let their former allies get them with their trousers downafter the attack putin offered his sympathy and something more to bush intelligence cooperation free passage to us supplies and even a base ulyanovsk to support the usled intervention in afghanistan plus the russianbacked northern alliance as a bootsontheground force against al qaida and the talibans etc what was the thank you for all of that bush announced the us withdrawal from abm treaty a pillar of mad and of the power balance between russia and usa go do such people a favorat that point the goodwill of russian toward the west was already quite low it was 80 in 1990 40 in 1999 20 in 2002 the last straw came around 2004 when the nato passed the borders of ussr with the entry of the baltic states russians had already some axes to grind with them about the way they treated the local russianspeaking minority noncitizen status treatments which are usual for immigrants applied to people born living and working in the same country since decades etc but to figure us bombers and missiles based just a few minutes away from saint petersburg was not the kind of things that could ease the mutual relationsand indeed they got worse not only with the balts but with the eu they had entered there too always thanks to uk and poland and let alone with the us of ait was in 2007 that putin gave the famous munich speech which boiled down to a simple concept enough is enough get lost and the bulk of russian people was fully agreeing with himas an epilogue i will quote the words that a grinning russian diplomat said to his western colleagues some years ago answering their shock about the increasing contacts between russia and china if a girl tells a boy no too many times the boy looks for another girl,human
411,we should be electing two governments one for social issues and one for economicsas the title says i believe that if we divided governments into two parts it would be beneficial for everyone of usmy main reasons for believing this is we could separate our economic social and political for political i mean things like foreign politics beliefs so that someone who is for example socially conservative and more left leaning economically doesnt have to decide whether he values more his social or economical beliefs as i said we wouldnt have to trade our social or economic beliefs for their counterpart this way we dont risk being stuck with economic or social politics we dont like just because in that moment we value more the other one i see this all the time some people dislike most rightleaning social beliefs but much prefer their economics in my idea there could not be any crossover between economic and social parties this would make parties less divided and much more focused on their objectives without the need to balance social politics and economics parties would also need to cater to a smaller audience so that their beliefs would be a little less nuanced and less dilutedobviously i recognize how some issues may arise from this some economic and political doctrines are somewhat incompatible with each other making it harder for the two parts of the government to cooperate there isnt a hard divide between economics and social politics they are extremely connected to that also makes it harder for the two parts to cooperate defining what is the field of the economic government and what is the field of the social government could also be difficulthowever id expect that it would be hard for completely opposite social and economic doctrines to find themselves in the government as social beliefs are connected with economic beliefs and vice versa so that i wouldnt expect for example to find democratic socialists and hardline conservatives together in the government id also put an executive political figure that would try to unite the two parts and help them cooperate and harmonize their different beliefs it could be an elected president or as i would prefer a monarch or anything elsewhy cmv as much as i am interested in politics i am no expert so there is likely something serious im missing that would make this system crumble completely,human
412,we will redistribute wealth with ubi or first world society as we know it collapses no other optionsi would like my view changed so i can better understand why other people are not concerned about this is there something i dont know ai is going to knock out most jobs corporate profits will continue to rise that is actually fine just need to tax that money and redistribute it is there some third scenario i cant comprehend where most peoples jobs are knocked out there is no ubi and people continue to function normallyit would be nice to see a less bleak future or it would be nice if people at least agreed on how to make the future not bleak,human
413,it is okay to be willfully ignorant antiintellectual and isolated as long as you dont hurt anyone elsei am a person unable to deal with the realization that moral nihilism is true in the sense that stuff like stealing rape and murder is not objectively wrong all laws are arbitrary and the meaning behind the word should does not exist or is just used as meaning what is good for your selfish biological survival it makes me depressed and makes me not want to fight for any ideals because it means i just value ideals for selfish reasons or pointless reasonsi am a person too dumb to be an engineer and to old to be a soldier but i am physically fit enough to have a job or do some kind of volunteer stuff however when i have tried doing all those things i just have to keep a mask on all the time and the exhaustion of it all means i arguably never truly contribute i also definitely should not do political work since my fear of nihilism means i lean toward authoritarian stuff like platos noble lie and censorship of art i could easily become the useful idiots of fascists since i sort of glorify enlightened dictatorshipsi am currently living on a sort of welfare agreement with the social services in my country i am receiving welfare as long as i study however i am only studying to stay on welfare not to study something to one day become smart and give back to society i lack common sense and whatever other people have that causes them to believe and know something is true i generally doubt things as much as possible by defaultexpected counter argument you should try talking to a psychologist or philosophical counseling  i had a digital appointment with philosopher that also had degree in psychology i asked him if it was possible to be an atheist and believe in moral universalism something like kantian deontology for atheists he said no and said he personally believe humans being have to chose a system and willfully lie to themselves to survive  he was brutally honest which i did not expect but i guess i am glad he was well i wish he told me lies to be honest but its too late nowexpected counter argument 2 you are not contributing anything to society  yes this is true but this is sort of the point of my cmv though i mean how exactly am i to contribute anyway i guess having children is the most needed thing for western countries but i think only fully mentally stable and healthy people should have children it is better to have less children than more but they are unhappy or unsafe also i do spend some of my money on consuming culture and support art well actually art and stories make me sad as welli do not intend to harm anyone or steal the exception to the stealing is being on welfare i guess i think that everything i am doing should be seen as okay i will avoid philosophy which makes me depressed but not force antiintellectualism on other people i also wont be rude to people or not offer help in situations like where people fall over or ask me to hold a door open i would also call the police and firemen if someone was in trouble of course i guess i will always behave so because of a holdover in my mind thinking those things are good or badwant to me it clear i am open to changing my view i actually want to since i think my view is seen as shameful and wrongalso please dont recommend raskphilosophy they dont like questions like this and will remove it quickly or i will have to rephrase it to the degree i will get no answer that is relevant to my actual individual situationthank you for reading if you have any questions feel free to ask,human
414,the people of the united states have the right to refer to their country as america if they wantdisclaimer im not from the united states of america but im also not latin american eitherim a huge believer in selfdetermination on scales as small as the individual and as large as nations i generally think that groups of people should be allowed to determine who they are and how they want to show themselves to the world of course we can never control other peoples perception but we can self identify and try to shape that perception in recent years ive seen a lot of people mostly on the internet arguing that referring to the us as america is a misnomer because america refers to a continent or two continents depending on your worldview i think this argument often comes from people living in latin america but there could be others im not certain ive seen some people argue this from a linguistics standpoint like calling the us america is a grammatical error and ive seen others make an antiimperialist case arguing that americans or united statesians maybe are trying to assert themselves as the masters of the western hemispherei think policing language is often though certainly not always unproductive it seems to me like this is a case of outsiders people not from the us trying to police how people inside the us describe themselves i think that americans should be allowed to call themselves whatever they feel beyond this i think the linguistic argument just doesnt work most north american english speakers dont think of america as being a word for a single continent they think of north america and south america or maybe the americas,human
415,celebrities shouldnt get backlash for working with unethical brandscelebrities always get a bunch of backlash for doing deals or working with companies who have done some unethical things one example is athletes signed to nike i seen some people on reddit bashing nba players for supporting and working with nike despite them using child labour in developing countries but why is it always the athletes or celebrities getting the backlash what about the company actually putting kids to work or the millions of people buying nike lebron james for example is signed to nike but nike is paying him and promoting his product lebron obviously gets a clear benefit from this whats the excuse for the average person who willingly spends hundreds to thousands of hard earned money at nike each year though they have no benefit and are actually paying a premium to shop at nikein this instance i would say the average person is more guilty as they are supporting child labour for nothing and could spend less elsewhere not to mention you never hear nike or amazon employees get backlash but they work for and benefit from the same companies whats the difference between them and an athlete sponsor they both work with the company for a paycheque and could go elsewhere,human
416,there is no reason to assume animals cant experience love like we cana question i keep asking myself is this why do people act like every instance of animals showing affection can be explained away as different than oursive heard people say things like dogs dont really love you they just love that you give them food and i guess i just dont really understand because we could do the same with humans if we applied that logic consistently oh you dont really love your family youre just conditioned to show them affection because they raised you and gave you food youre biologically wired to stick close to them because often times that would have given you a bigger chance for survival in the wildwhy are people so determined to separate themselves from animals sure humans are different from a lot of other species in the world but every species is unique if the affection shown by animals isnt indicative of love then how can we say that the affection we feel and show is i guess i should clarify i am not speaking about all animals here but mostly about mammals who have an amygdala if were willing to call our own biological feelings love then i dont get why we cant call that of animals the same,human
417,usd isnt worth it anymore the amount of time it takes to earn x amount of dollars isnt worth the goods it can afford most employment is a means of imprisonment in a downward spiral of standard of livingthe time needed to care for ones self to maintain their health is nickeled and dimed away from them for usd amounts which dont well reflect the implicated costs of healthcare which arise from stress injuries diet stressors lack of flexibility in what and when to eat or rest or even accomodate medical intervention appointmentsthe time needed to pay for childcare at median wages is not worth the usd recieved by working instead the cost of daily transporting the child supplying daycare with extra supplies which may have been made more cost efficient by having the flexibility to manage on a schedule at home deposits and the costs of losing work to go pick them up in emergency or sickness as one still pays the entire month cost regardless of their absences at daycare but at work one still

tell me theyre doing fine vast majority of the united states citizens will be fumbling to explain how this is crazy you dont understand i wasnt always like thisits just thatwell you see mhm you can work hard as a mfr let yourself be exploited with a smile but you arent gonna come out with any different odds than every other person bud spare us of the hubris you arent more hardworking than most poor people you just havent had your time yet time is ticking and youre not in control all life needs is a little tiny nick in the glass for the whole thing to begin to crack and then shatterdependency on usd is an irresponsible approach to life for well over half the nation employment doesnt provide enough income to justify the costs of time lost to work nor does it provide any pragmatic means of provisioning one with the ability to reliably provide basic needs to themselves or even their children i wouldnt peg it as an approach of being a responsible parent anymore the costs even through an optimistic lens outweigh the gains of employmentconsidering all this i reflect on the reason we need usd it doesnt grow plants it isnt land i can live on isnt edible doesnt light up doesnt watch my children doesnt heal my body it is because even the very basic needs of life food land safety etc are actively withheld from us hostage until we sell our time for usd to often the same entities which take that usd and only then allow us an arbitrary amount of resources for itfleets millions of tonnes of food that wasnt bought toys unopened tools unused medications unused and so much more are buried in landfills en masse daily not because nobody needed them not because nobody wanted them quite the opposite it was done as a result of ensuring that they were withheld from people who needed or wanted them but didnt have more usd to give for them millions of tonnes a day buried in the earth specifically to make sure nobody could have them because nobody had come forth with the usd to give for them regardless of a dying human a child with special needs any regard for other species international needs repurposing concepts charities or just making the lives easier for the working people of the nation who sacrifice everything to keep things running without infldulging further into it full automation is not ways away it is coming faster and faster artificial scarcity is well known and observedemployment wages are no longer an efficient or practical approach for meeting the needs of over half the country usd is a lost cause as it is not amidst an economic architecure which enables any degree of functional circulating rate before being heavily reconcentrated amidst a small group it is not responsible as a parent to continue the idea of employment being the right answer our childrens lives are at stake and we devote nearly all our waking hours to an ideal and corporations which knowingly exploit us and leave us unable to provide or fight for a respectable life for our childrenwe have a fiduciary duty to our children yet we do not act in their best interest as parents by giving away our time and labor for less than appropriate prices its legally arguable that you are abusive and a failure as a parent by not withholding labor ideally collectively to demand for far higher wages to provide for yourself and your childthis includes me too

418,its fine if youre a trans woman but you are still not a womanthe term woman should only refer to a biological woman not somebody who transitioned i along with the majority of straight men am only attracted to a biological woman if i were single and a trans woman wanted to go on a date i would decline not because im homophobic or dont agree with their transition its because thats simply what i want if you want to refer to yourself as a trans woman thats fine but you need the trans in there you cant lie to people and call yourself a biological woman or thats pretty much just a catfish you should always be straight forward about it you can look like a woman but you are in fact and always will be a trans woman that 4 letter word is very important,human
419,the prison sentence for killing someone while driving drunk should be an automatic life sentencenormally life sentences are for people guilty of murder 1 or murder 2 a majority of people who kill someone while driving drunk fall under involuntary vehicular manslaughter that makes senseif you cause an accident and someone else dies but you were sober while behind the wheel as long as you didnt do something egregiously negligent i get it it happens its unfortunate but it happenshowever i am certain that 99 of people who drive drunk drank voluntarily and voluntarily got behind the wheel knowing they were drunk factoring that into consideration if you cause a fatal accident when you voluntarily drank and voluntarily got behind the wheel of a twoton machine while you knew you were drunk you are the literal scum of the earth and a selfish irresponsible human beingbecause you put yourself in an inebriated state on your own volition and while in said inebriated state got behind the wheel on your own volition and caused a fatal accident your charge should still be vehicular manslaughter but your prison sentence should be the same as if you committed 1st or 2nd degree murder,human
420,expressing anger in public is not goodhave you ever seen someone flip out in public over the littlest thing do you think that thats ever acceptable or that angry outbursts are just a normal part of life or do you think that we should keep our anger out of the public space if it isnt in direct response to unkindness or discrimination or something i was talking to my friend the other day about anger and he says he loves being angry in public he thinks its more cathartic to get angry and have people see it he says it makes him feel understood or seen or something i dont get that at all i saw a girl the other night start screaming at a pizza shop because they didnt have pepperoni then she burst into tears and i overheard her tragic backstory of what seemed like a really tough year i feel like this may be a gendered and cultural issue as well because i was raised in a culture that discouraged anger and presented shame and sadness as an alternative so for me if i was ever angry i would usually just cry i also came from a household where anger even if it existed in the interactions that i had were always hidden in the household like when i was little and i had done something to upset my mom she would turn to me and grit her teeth and whisper to me to wait until we got homei can imagine the importance of anger in resistance or reaction to like discrimination or as a form of activism that makes sense even if i couldnt personally do it but anger thats personal should not be displayed in public because it causes an upset to everyone and you are pushing it onto everyone else but also i can understand how it might be beneficial to express it out loud and how doing something out loud for people to see might make it more likely for someone to help you or maybe even just for you to understand your own feelings by expressing anger in a place where you see other peoples reactions after seeing that girl cry she seemed like her friends were nicer to her not meaner to her after and i found that unusual she didnt even apologize to the worker anyway what do you think have you ever been in a situation like that losing your temper and then feeling better have you guys ever had a public angry outburst have you seen someone else have one what happened did they get in trouble did they calm down after they stopped yelling or just get amped up ive seen some people freak out on friends workers and even strangers before on the street whats the craziest thing youve ever seen  do you think it helps to be angry in public,human

427,inclusivity is an illusion of progress and is the destruction of excellenceoh boy i know its controversial but this is how i feel so id like some good counterargumentsinclusivity is a destructive and misguided policy that has led to the degradation of our society and our values the push for diversity and inclusivity has created an environment where individuals are judged not by their abilities or achievements but by their race gender sexual orientation or other irrelevant characteristicsthe promotion of inclusivity has led to the creation of quotas and affirmative action programs that discriminate against individuals who are not part of certain minority groups this policy is not only unfair but it also undermines the very principles of meritocracy and hard work that our society was built onin addition the emphasis on inclusivity has led to the suppression of free speech and the stifling of dissenting opinions individuals who express opinions that are not in line with the current progressive narrative are often ostracized cancelled or even fired from their jobs this is not the society that our forefathers envisioned where individuals had the right to express their opinions without fear of retribution or persecutionmoreover the concept of inclusivity ignores the reality that individuals from different backgrounds may have vastly different values beliefs and cultural practices that may not align with each other the push for inclusivity has created an environment where individuals are forced to accept and celebrate lifestyles and values that are not in line with their own this is not only impractical but also impossiblein conclusion the promotion of inclusivity and diversity is a flawed and misguided policy that undermines the very fabric of our society we must reject this policy and return to a system that values hard work talent and individual achievement regardless of an individuals background or identity only by doing so can we restore the values and principles that made our society great,human

429,modern conservativesrepublicans or whatever are primarily a supremacy groupmodern as in 2016 onwards not to be confused with pre2016 conservatives most of the modern conservatives want to be or feel superior to others with key slogans and catch phrases such as liberal tears lets go brandon fck joe biden own the libs one asks what are their key stances on such so far they are primarily focused on the cultural war which means that people who fit into cultures such as lgbtq gender and race will be under scrutinyduring the 2020 election sure the inflation and oil was an issue but modern conservatives failed to clearly propose solutions to that problem but focused on the culture war that ultimately costed them the electioncurrently the biggest political issue is trans people mtg had a sign that said trust the science now she believes science where was that energy during the covid era she is only doing that because the goal of modern conservatism is superiority they need someone to feel superior to and lets say they do pass antitrans laws would they want to come together nope would they work for a compromise although for issues like lgbtq rights there are no compromises nope they would say winner winner heres my prize you are a loser who sits and criesexamples of modern conservatives would be trump gates boebert mtg desantis abbotexamples of traditional republicans would be mccain romney liz cheneyexamples of grifters follow the   votes shapiro crowder tucker carlson praeger 90 of conservative podcasts tv personalities vloggers etc hawley he deserves special mentionfor hawley he might be modern but he is intelligent he can easily switch back and forth he is the most threatening to lgbtqs females nonwhites and nonchristians if he becomes president if he wanted to he will make anyone who is non white male christian straight feel subhuman,human
430,the cliche of marriage being expensive is flat out wrong considering the value of combining resourcesits been a common trope that marriage is expensive jokes have been made about it on sitcoms in cartoons stand up comedy routines etc but that legitimately couldnt be further from the truthfor nearly everyone the main expense they have is housing for most people it consumes between 20 and 50 of their income this really cannot be changed especially in major cities where there is a very real lower limit to how much rooms apartments and houses cost even in undesirable areasamericans are increasingly burdened by renthttpswwwpewtrustsorgenresearchandanalysisreports201804americanfamiliesfaceagrowingrentburden and with skyrocketing housing costs for many its the only way they can get housingbut marriage or a significant other you live with is a big help to this on an individual level each partner cuts their rent expenses in half once they move in with each other many stop needing roommates entirely because 2 people can live in a studio or one bedroom apartment there are people who are able to live with multiple people in one bedroom apartments using bed sheets as walls however this is illegal in many jurisdictions due to zoning restrictions with roughly twice the income and twice the necessities married couples often can better utilize buying in bulk without worrying about food going bad prematurely or that 18 pack of paper towels being enough to overdraw your bank account this brings the cost per unit of necessities like groceries down as well buying in bulk has such a drastic effect on peoples finances that its been cited as a factor that keeps poor families poorhttpswwwwprorgstudylowincomehouseholdsmissoutsavingsbecausetheycantaffordbuybulki cannot think of anything that gets more expensive per person when one gets married due to the simple fact that combining resources is so effective at reducing costs,human

432,capitalism is the best economic systemfor the record im not advocating for complete unregulated laissezfaire capitalism im all in favor of certain things being public such as education health care law enforcement emergency services roads and transportation etc im also in favor of regulations in order to do things like protect the environment protect workers etc however generally speaking an economic system that is primarily characterized by private ownership private property profit driven businesses etc is the best economic system possible to be clear a lot of people seem to salivate over scandinavian countries like denmark for example which are still capitalist countries obviously capitalism has its flaws but it is by far better than any alternative capitalism takes advantage of human nature and creates the proper incentives that facilitate the strongest economy compared to the alternatives capitalism generally also results in better higher quality products compare that to the primary alternatives which are socialism and communism these systems have been complete failures every time they have been implemented some people argue that they failed due to western influence which is honestly just copium these systems simply do not work because they dont mesh with human nature under these systems the only result is poverty becoming much worse and more widespread less overall production and lower quality products being produced i understand why a lot of people usually young people are disgruntled about capitalism but what these people need to realize is that a lot of their complaints stem from the fact that life just kinda sucks in general you can fantasize about a perfect idealized utopia all you want its simply never going to happen things like social hierarchy economic scarcity and human nature in general will always be the reality of life capitalism is the best we can do deal with it,human
433,for small countries locked in a rivalry with a superpower it only makes sense for them to develop a nuclear program with strike capabilitywhat the us invasion of iraq afghanistan and the russian invasion of ukraine have shown is that world powers are capable of anything to enforce their political agendas a sovereign country that is in bad relations with a world power must generate a nuclear program capable of attacking those world powers or their allies it is the only life insurance that these countries have to ensure that they are not annihilated or become involved in a war that will destroy them economically  if taiwan had the nuclear capacity to attack china power relations and negotiations would be different therefore the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons only favors world powers  that can be applied to both north korea and iran currently,human
434,modern feminism is no longer about equalityto clarify before yall come for my head i absolutely support gender equality in every traditional sense im pro choice have had roughly the same number of guy and girl friends in my life and fully believe that women are just as capable in every mental arena as men that being said what the fuck are we doing heremore women than men attend college women can be doctors and lawyers and win the popular vote for president and nobody bats an eye the wage gap exists on paper but economists have debunked it repeatedly women tend to choose less lucrative career paths more frequently and take more time off for familypersonal reasons men are also more likely to seek the high paid executive jobs and negotiate their salary when hired this isnt the 1960s nor is it the middle east to say women are held down by some phantom patriarchal force is both disrespectful to them and flatout inaccurateadditionally women also have certain societal advantages they disproportionately win custody battles and do better in divorces they have an easier time getting romantic attention admittedly a doubleedged sword but still they are allowed to display more emotion with less riducle and more and more they enjoy the social benefits of being from a marginalized group without much of the struggles faced by other such subsets minorities lgtbq disabled people etcthis really clicked for me when i tuned into espn tonight for some basketball and realized they were doing allfemale broadcast teams for international womens day i get it its a fine gesture but the espn crew is essentially 5050 genderwise as is additionally id be willing to bet that the networks viewership demographics are more along the lines of 8020 male in short they are already an equal opportunity workplace in a sausagedominanted field but that clearly isnt enough for some people i feel this is because the modern feminist wants to win a gender war more so than they want actual equalityi have tremendous respect for first and second wave feminists my own mother was the first female engineer at several different workplaces in the 1980s i dont want to be a misogynist but it feels like id be characterized as one by many in 2023 what am i missing about this third wave and how can i correct my thinking,human

438,bitterness towards my f22 sister f20so ive recently come to realize that i am developing bitterness towards my sister we used to be close and had a good relationship up until a few months ago we dont really talk a lot and rarely see each other we both still live at home but i work full time and she is a student and is at her boyfriends place most of the time these days i think most of this bitterness comes from when we were younger and how she acted and sometimes still acts the same way now when we were teenagers the first memorable thing that comes to mind is when i was 19 and she was 17 she screamed at me in front of our parents about how i was spoiled and always get what i want and how its unfair the context behind this is that i had just got my license and my brother was in the process of buying a new car he offered me his old car which was a beat up honda with over 200k kms on it and of course i wanted it i wouldve been crazy to not take a free car of course it had some small repairs that needed to be done which my father generously paid for as an early birthday gift to me but other than those repairs to get it running i paid for everything else to maintain that car i paid for insurance maintenance new tires etc what i never understood is how mad my sister got about this she didnt even have her license and the car wasnt worth much anyways why was it my fault that my brother offered me the car when it made the most sense for it to go to me she was still in high school and i was already working full time and needed to get around i even told her that she could have the car once i got a new one i only had the car for a year before i got a new job and was able to afford a better one for myself the thing that really bothered me about this whole situation is that i would have been insane to not take the car i had never been offered such a gift in my life she called me spoiled but that was the only thing she could come up with when i asked her how i was spoiledanother thing i hold bitterness towards is how she acts towards our parents my mother is asian and if anyone has foreign parents you know how stubborn they can be when my sister was 18 she was never not having screaming matches with my mom but the thing was she was always instigating them she would keep egging my mom on until eventually my mom would get really mad at her she would constantly not help around the house like chores and say she was too busy with university but i could always hear her yelling playing video games with friends recently my mom asked her to put away the dishes and she said no because i dont eat here like bro they are literally letting you live here rent free and they still pay for your fucking phone bill and you wont do something as simple as put away the dishes as soon as i turned 18 it was good luck were not paying for anything anymore i pay for all of my own things i paid for my way through school i pay them rent for living at home we got a dog a couple years ago with the condition that everyone in the family contributes to it i consistently pay for his dog food grooming and paid for most of the essentials we needed for him as a puppy i paid for his puppy school i have never seen her contribute anything for him she only lets him outside to go potty sometimes she always uses my toothpaste shampoo qtips hairbrushes literally whatever is mine thats in our shared bathroom she is 20 years old and i have never seen her buy her own toothpaste or soap we share the bathroom but i am always the one to clean it she leaves her wet clothes in the wash and leaves the house so no one else can do their laundry until she comes back rant over i guesstldr bitter towards sister because of things that happened when we were growing up,human

to read this and offer anything they can please know i will be extremely gratefulour history we have been together for nearly four years now just two months left for that we both love each other at least she did just some time ago it has been a longdistance relationship in between as well we were together for a year when we first met by together i mean we met daily and stuff after that it has been spells of a few weeks together and then months of ldr we never really faced any problems before all this happened now i had been preparing for my mba for the last year or so and i am a very aspirational person i want to get into the creamy colleges and i am very close my interviews are done i am just waiting for the results and she is currently pursuing public relations and advertising from a very good university as well she has done well for herselfher problems  point of view last year on her birthday she got a dog she is like seriously crazy about dogs that puppy was her dream she loved him more than she has loved anything or anyone else and i was happy for her i loved that dog too i had never seen her that happy and trust she was extremely happy with me before he came along i was all the more elated but extremely tragically the little dude died to parvovirus at a very young age and she hasnt been the same since she has told me after her dog died she had really stopped caring much about anything except for me and told me that even her will to work towards us has reduced on top of this she had caught tuberculosis of the abdomen which made her very cranky and always in pain at her stomach and the medicines had very severe affect on her health i could tell over the last one year i was dating a very different person but i knew  still know  that i am okay with it i truly love her now since january we have been arguing over the phone a lot she had stopped listening to me i would catch her scrolling instagram while talking to me not really paying attention while i was only and only talking to her i patiently tried to wait other such stuff out as well and respectfully told her that this kinda stuff irritates me a little it will be good if just 1520 minutes of your day could be dedicated to me shes extremely busy from 9 to 7 her college is like crazy hectic other than that she would accuse me of being not available when she needed me she would often say that how she needs me there with her physically which was not possible at that moment  she would say how i have lost my emotional side and became very mechanical she would also tell me that our relationship was now feeling more and more like a work to do rather than something natural but she would always say in the end that she is there to work shit out and wants to be with me and expected me to understand that the death of her dog 1 and a half years ago still has a huge impact on her life and how she feels like a failure as she could not take care of one being who trusted her with his life reasons which to me seemed fair and she would ask me if i had the patience till she got out of this phase of hers she also has trouble making her friends which made her lonely in her new place though she lived with her younger sister who goes to school there so she told me that i amwas her only source of relaxation peace or assurance that things will be okaymy pov first of all let me tell anyone who reads this i love this woman i have never felt the way i feel about her and she at least says the same even now althought i am 1000 sure she did before few months ago i for four months spent my every single second of my life with her after her dogs death just to take care of her and make sure shes okay and i did not have to force any single action or emotion i showed at that point of time it all came naturally to me and i have never made her count that i am just trying to present my side here i was the one who took her to the hospital for 13 straight days as well to get at the root cause of her issue which eventually was tb you get the gist i will do this shit keeping my goals and aims aside for only my family and her i have been extremely busy for past one year i agree the entrance exams in my country are very tough to crack i had to study day and night and was always tired at the end of the day so a lot of times i could not talk to her at night when she was free believe me when i say i tried like hell but there came a point when my body would naturally shut off for sleep because i come from a middle class household i had to crack the exams and interviews swiftly in one go i did not become mechanical this phase of my life the pressure and anxiety had taken a toll on me i tried talking it out with her but she was not in a space where she could offer me any comfort as she was going through shit her self it made both of us kinda distant as we kept certain things to our selves she still shared a lot i didnt as mainly i did not want to give her more tension talking about the arguments recently since the beginning of this year she had just stopped listening to me or anything i would want to say i agree i shouted multiple times atleast 45 times in past three months and i regret that one should never shout at their significant other i have apologized to her but she has hard time letting those arguments go even though she acknowledges it was not me alone she says the love is lost and she wants that spark back i have a tough time telling her that it was since her dog died that she had started drifting apart please dont think this is selfish this is what happened i have never said her these words i held on still hold on 16 months later that i have two herniated disks and extreme anxiety and no one was there for me as well during that period of time but i never blamed her or accused her like thatwhere everything broke down i had recently gone to meet her as i was finally free from my exams and interviews please note that i did not have money to book flight tickets she was the one who did that which made me think she really wants me there maybe she did the day i arrived at her apartment i could see she was behaving weirdly and hiding something anytime i would touch her phone she would find a reason to take it away i loved her phones camera and was always clicking her or mine photos only she has a pixel i have never been the snoopy guy she has told me multiple times this is what she really likes about me than the previous guys shes been with so it felt weird that she did that now we had went out i had brought this beautiful dress for her long ago which she told me she will wear when i will come to meet her she wore that dress i was extremely tired after coming back from the date and slept as soon as i came back i woke up around 4 am to drink water and saw her phone ringing by some guy i opened her phone and saw that she had sent her photos to that guy in that dress where she looked extremely hot like she is hot and pretty and way out of my league trust me and that guy had told her i love you and shit she had obviously said nothing to the i love yous even telling him to stay away but as i scrolled up the chat i saw that she had flirted a lot with him and eventually 3 weeks ago they had exchanged i love yous multiple times i broke down crying and she woke up and started explaining and stuff what broke my trust was she snatched the phone and deleted the chat saying it will only hurt you more and i dont want that then she went on saying that she loves me wants to be with me and will stop everything with that person but she admitted that she had gone to him out of frustration of the long distance and liked the attention he gave her she said most of the i love yous i told him were when i was drunk and that she had never been physical with him or even hugged him and did not mean the ilys at all told me she had just sent those photos to him because he was asking constantly to and she liked the attention he gave her i trust her on the physical part because i know her that much she said whatever she felt about him was a phase as i was so far away and unavailable and we had started fighting a lotnow shes asking for time saying that this entirely wasnt her fault to which i agree upto certain extent it was the circumstances as well but i came to understand that she never really realized i could be having my own mental health problems as well just because i wasnt available youd go to some other guy to do that stuff doesnt fit right with me the bigger question to me is how do i trust her when she deleted that chat i am a hopeless romantic but theres a limit to me as well she told me she wants us to work and shes ready to do that but before that she needs time and has told me not to call her my girlfriend or treat her like that for few days or weeks and wants us to start fresh like meeting again going on a first date and shit which i think might work but again the issue of trust arises i had always imagine after going to my mba college it will be much easier to meet her talk to her as at home my parents are very nosy and i am poor guy as of now whos working really hard i was doing that in part for her as well i wanted to travel with her live with her and the mba colleges i have given interviews for give really hefty paying jobs after graduation so the life we imagined was close the time shes taking is making me really anxious i tried to tell her that lets talk about what happened but she said she cannot as of now she doesnt have the mental space to do that i feel like i am being tortured because i want to be with her and she tells me the same but then continues to delay the sorting process since 6 days now i am giving her space infact shes the one texting or video calling me most of the times since i came back the fact that i believe some of what she says is that since i was there we had a lot of sex she was physically very open to me like she usually is and i trust my instincts enough to know that she hasnt physically been with someone elsefor atleast 20 more months we will have to do ldr trust will remain an issue for me and i think only she can address it i feel desperate as fuck waiting for her but it is a relationship of four years with me still loving her and she saying that she still obviously is attracted to me and has feelings for me but isnt sure if its love she says shes seen people fall out of love and then back and believes that will happen to us as well but the wait is killing me i am scared if i push her to sort or talk things out right now or soon things will snap again i am giving her space and time but it is kind of a torture to me because in utterly simple words i love this woman i wouldve died for her no questions asked i have done shit for her i would have never done for anyone elseampx200bis going ahead or waiting for her a good idea can the trust and spark be restoredampx200btldr girlfriend not in good mental space i was extremely busy with my mba prep she felt lonely and ignored started flirting and sharing photos with another guy did that for a month and did not bother to tell me about it i found out accidentally she says she wants to be with me even still i am okay with that but the wait shes taking to sort things out is killing me,human

455,boyfriend m26 does not want my best friend back in my life but i f23 doim going to make this quick short and simple my boyfriend m26 and i f23 will be together for a year in may we have an amazing relationship he is great to me and we have so much fun together i love him very much and nothing would ever change that so heres the storywe met each other through friends my best friend who keep in mind has been my best friend for seven or eight years was dating my boyfriends friend they broke up before my boyfriend and i even got together we ended up hanging out with them at the club which was the night i met my boyfriend we hooked up that night and then began dating a month later my best friend was upset when we started dating which is understandable because it was her exs friend basically the situation got out of hand and she was afraid he was taking me away from her and she was saying bad things about him and even tried to tell me he was engaged which wasnt true by the way she just wanted to push me away from him because she wanted me to herself we got into several fights over this and i hated having to choose between my boyfriend and my best friend which i never wanted to do in the first place then there was one night that she began going off on me over text and she was drunk at the time she did apologize for it but i was starting to get sick of the drama we stopped talking after this completely months and months go by shes asked me to hangout several times and a part of me got very nervous about doing so because i didnt want to go through that again all the fights and all the drama she even apologized several times over everything she did and said she wants to make it up to my boyfriend and tell him how sorry she is and wants to try and be civil but i declined at this point my boyfriend hates my ex best friend and holds a very big grudge towards her another thing to keep in mind my best friend and i used to fight all the time and would go months without talking its just what we did so this was kind of normal for us we fought over stupid things too just bickered a bit nothing crazy you know how girls can be ill be honest i missed her like crazy no one compared to my friendship with her she was my best friend we did everything together she listened to me and looked out for me and i did the same for her i had friends after her and most of them are so self absorbed besides one of them who i am close with my ex best friend and i were civil at this point just not hanging out she offered to do my hair because she works in a salon and did my hair for years before all of this happened i said yes and just got my hair done with her yesterday so of course we are talking and catching up and telling each other how much we missed one another i was even scared to tell my boyfriend i was getting my hair done by her because he has this huge hatred towards her he did know i was getting it done by her and he is so afraid we were going to start talking and be friends again well of course when i saw her yesterday all the memories came back and i missed her like crazy we are both crazy so once we see each other we just click again so quickly she just moved out and wants me to see her apartment she wants to plan for me and my other best friend to see her apartment next friday and get dinner and drinks it felt extremely refreshing to slowly gain a friendship with her again she said how sorry she is about everything that happened and once again wants to make amends with my boyfriend and wants everything to be okay because we were always inseparable when i got home from getting my hair done my boyfriend and i ate dinner and we were having a good night he saw a couple texts from her on my phone and immediately goes i knew this was going to happen i got upset and told him that we arent best friends but we are texting and starting up a friendship again he was so pissed about it he told me he loves how things are going and he doesnt want her to ruin it which she wont i would never let that happen she knows im in a serious relationship and just wants me back in her life and i feel the same way she doesnt expect anything crazy from me just a couple hangouts once in a while which i dont see that as a bad thing his feelings about the situation are valid and i understand why he is nervous about me being friends with her again but i wish he can just accept it i havent told him she invited me to see her new place next week because i have a feeling he will freak out i see him every single day and i love seeing him but i just want him to be able to accept that she is in my life again it shouldnt have to be this big of a deal he has friends i dont like at all but i dont care if he hangs out with themalso my boyfriend is amazing we have a great connection and so much fun together i love him with all my heart and would never let anything come between him and i tldrboyfriend doesnt want my ex best friend back in my life because he doesnt like her but i do want her back in my life please give me honest opinions and advice on what i should do,human

relationshiphttpswwwredditcomrrelationshipscomments11fr2qlmymotheristryingtosetmeupwithsomeoneutmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmfupdate my 23f parents 51f and 56 m tried setting me up with someone elseheres the update so a couple months back i posted saying my parents dont approve of my current relationship with a man that has a child hes also has darker skin we have been together for 6 months a couple weeks ago i had the ultimate blow up with my mom ill be honest i lost it i was swearing and crying told my mom i was leaving and she cant stop me from doing so so i told them to back off and its my life packed up my stuff and i left i moved in with my grandmother until i figure something out with a rental i started working again instead of devoting my life to my parents i feel happier i havent thought of any of the deep dark thoughts that used to cross my mind and all in all my mental health has improved substantially in just a couple short weeks my relationship with my boyfriend 28m has improved drastically we used to get into some kind of argument involving my parents quite often and now we dont really have any major disagreements on anything in all i feel way better in a lot of ways my mom and dad still try to reach out with kind words which ill be honest i wish they wouldve done this a lot sooner i didnt need to be pushed out the door because of my relationship i didnt need to lose it like how i did if they had just accepted it and moved on maybe if they wouldve gave him a better chance than they did this whole freak out would have never happened what made me snap was the talking behind my back my parents were telling my friends how i could do better how i shouldnt tie myself down the thing is that my boyfriend has a good paying job he takes good care of his son and he treats me so well he makes sure im taken care of and i knew how it was breaking his heart that my parents refused to see that they just labelled him as trash and moved on the thing that was my final straw was when one of my parents told a friend of mine that they need to hang out with me more to keep me away from that trash then shortly after him and i went fb official well we already were but shared the status my parents flipped said they had to talk to me and tried to push more work onto me because if i had enough time to share on facebook i had enough time to do more work i got home after helping a relative i was exhausted and just plain old mad as well as upset so i started my car and packed my bags by the time i was taking the last of my things out one of my parents came into the kitchen thats when i lost it i said they call him all these rude things when he has done nothing to them hes come out for free multiple times to help out he still offers to help out even after knowing all the things they have called him he doesnt even hate them for the things theyve called him he just wants a chance to prove himself as a good man for me but they wont even allow him on the property i screamed about how upset i was over the treatment i have gotten since i moved home all the work and effort i have put in how i keep my mouth shut to keep the peace because they already have too much on their plate it hurt me im still hurt still cant believe i finally said something i wish i couldve held it in or i couldve fallen for someone who theyd approve of but i couldnt i cant picture my life without this man he treats me in the ways i had always wanted to be treated and has shown me what unconditional love is i couldnt give it up and i couldnt give him up for my parents there were a few times i wondered if i should split from him to keep the peace and keep my family but it brought me to tears every time just thinking id never have him in my life again a part of me still wishes i couldve been what they always wanted me to be but i couldnt be unfair to myself a part of me feels guilty for leaving i know they still couldve used my help and really theyre my parents i have loved them so much for so long unconditionally i could never hate them it broke my heart to freak like i did on them it made me feel like i was the crazy one and i shouldve held my tongue a bit longer but i couldnt i tried the calm sit down conversations i tried to get them to listen without losing it i still feel hurt but i feel way happier than i do hurt and i think that is where the guilt is coming from i feel guilty for being happy with my life because i know it bothered them and still does that i am in the relationship that i am in i wish it couldve been different i wish they wouldve given him the chance him and i both wanted but that isnt what happened so i am trying to move on did i make the right decision i feel free but at what cost tldr i have moved out a part of me feels guilty for leaving but i feel so free im happier and my mental health has improved substantially but i still feel guilt for choosing myself,human

465,i 19f cant orgasm with my boyfriend 18m who ive been dating for 4 years and im sexually attracted to someone else 23m big time should i suggest an open relationshipi 19f love my boyfriend deeply 18m we started off as high school best friends to sweethearts but now we study at universities in two different countries so were doing long distance for the context its going well we get to see each other quite often once a month we facetime a lot i wouldnt say i miss him a lot i am happy without him and i am even happier with him weve been through so much together and i cant stress this enough were both born and raised in ukraine and we fled the country together he lived with me my mom and two brothers in one room in a refugee shelter for half a year too yes that also affected our relationship in a way that at some point we felt like we were siblings we didnt have a chance to have sex while being there that often and the overall vibe was leading to that before and after that i never orgasmed with him but its not like i dont like sex with him i do its just that i wouldnt say it is extraordinary its fine its nice it feels pleasurablenow a year ago when i was 18 right after our 4th relationship anniversary and before the war started my two female best friends got me a trip to egypt as my birthday present it was one of the happiest weeks of my life i met an english guy 22m there and we clicked it felt like ive known him for years he wrote me 2 poems we spent so much time together just being lost in conversation for hours disclaimer i told him right away i had a boyfriend and nothing physical happened between us although he kissed me on the top of my head and brushed my thigh with his finger once so like some subtle touching but super respectful and never crossing the line he literally said he wouldnt do anything i wouldnt wanted to me but most importantly because of him i realised i have a massive praisedaddy kink he called me a good girl randomly once he knew what he was doing but tbh i was quite naive and my brain short circuited i was never the same again man altered my brain chemistry with his british accent charisma gentleman manners and teasing he also gave me his ring and we developed quite a strong emotional connection he even gave me his ring before i left and i still carry it even though its been a year anyways when i went home the war started and he would talk to me on the phone until the mornings comfort me id fall asleep to his voice and sometimes he turned out chat into a sexual direction once he sent me some raunchy voice messages saying how he thoroughly enjoys turning me on and making me crave him he described some of very explicit dreams that he had with me where he referred to fucking my pretty face i never stopped him or was against that but never directly engaged in these conversations they would surprise freeze me but oh dear god how i enjoyed him saying that ps i do feel guilty for that my bf doesnt know thati have never felt that intense craving for someone whenever that guy was around me i would shiver and get so fucking wet and he never even touched me that was when i realised im into dirty talk too at first it was very hard for me to get turned on to my boyfriend after that trip then i started picturing that guy during our sex but always felt guilt so couldnt relax then i started embracing the fact that i am attracted to him and it kinda faded away its been a looong time guys more than a year nowthe thing is no matter how much i try to enjoy sex with my boyfriend and maybe i am even quite satisfied with him in the moment of doing that i cant stop thinking about how that other guy made me feel he made me feel so sexy and i am for some reason convinced that he would make me cum easily maybe im wrong idk i really want to try an open relationship with my boyfriend and have sex with that guy because the desire has been killing me for a year now but i dont know how to explain that to my boyfriend first i already talked about my orgasm with him and i know he cares about me too but hes not into dirty talk and honestly dirty talk would sound weird in ukrainian and he couldnt do it in english we discussed that also i wanna be a submissive good girl we touched upon that too but i dont think thats what he wants he says that our sex is already perfect to him he used to say he wants to tie me up and shit but never initiated that and my last concern is that he knew about the guy that i had a crush on him during my vacation and we almost broke up because of that but decided to keep working on our relationship we agreed that i had a crush because something in our relationship back then was off and i sought that in others yeah thats pretty much it if youve read all that  youre my hero tbh please let me know all your thoughts on this and what should i dotldr i 19f cant orgasm with my boyfriend 18m who ive been dating for 4 years and im sexually attracted to someone else 23m who i met on a holiday big time even though its been more than a year my boyfriend doesnt share what i truly need from sex to be satisfied should i suggest an open relationship,human

474,my 24f best friend is a 35yearold man and everyone acts like this is super weird is it i met my friend j through work about a year and a half ago and hit it off this is gonna sound a little snobby but we were the only two who were ever not on our phones in the break room and usually reading instead so one day he asked what i was reading and that was that we discovered we have quite a bit in common from a shared love of fairly obscure book series to history traveling and even birdwatching birdwatching ive never met anyone else who cared at all about that there was never once i looked at him like that and it was all of maybe two weeks after we started talking that i found out hes gay and in a relationship anyhow so i didnt feel like there was anything wrong with this or anything to hide welli wound up dumping my boyfriend over it he became a huge controlling possessive asshole and really showed his true colors i tried to be understanding at first  its not crazy for a guy to feel threatened by his girlfriend spending time with another man and i knew he didnt think men and women could be friends but after i told my boyfriend about j being gay it actually made it worse he called me a liar he said j was too big and manly to be gay i wish i was joking i really do but legit this was his response it was at that moment my attraction to him dropped to zero and i started wondering what i ever saw in him to begin with we broke up shortly after and j also became single around this time for unrelated reasonssince then ive only loosely dated one other guy and he seemed similarly bothered by my friend so it didnt go anywherej is my best friend at this point so our lives have overlapped a lot we are admittedly an odd pair which we recognize and have laughed at hes 35 im 24 hes 64 im 52 hes a guy and im a girl our differences pretty much end there though im by far the youngest of his friends but until i told him how old i was when my birthday came up he thought i was in my late 20s we see each other at least once per week outside of work and text all of the time its a little less lately since j got a boyfriend and i tried to be respectful and fade into the background a little but his boyfriend is cool and has invited me for things as well lmao the only people who seem to have an issue are the people in my life and it makes me feel so weird and annoyed ive had such gross reactions from people someone once said hes grooming me knowing literally nothing about our relationship beyond the age difference my parents are also very bothered by me having a male friend older than me as well and im very disappointed that has been their reaction ive never had many friends period even when i was a kid i was a loner without much in common with other kids so if anything i thought theyd be happy actually i didnt expect them to have much of a reaction at all given that im 24 not 14 well j and i are planning a trip next month about a 7hr road trip to branson i mention this in passing to my parents and they were clearly really uncomfortable and insisted that i check in with them the whole time it honestly made me angry ive traveled alone and they have never done this aside from text us when you get there so its rather obvious why they are nowwere both adults and im not stupid i can see red flags like anyone else and there havent been any  to be clear i have no intention of ruining this friendship im just looking for different perspectives and how to deal with these weird attitudestldr i am really good friends with a 35yearold man i met at work and im 24f everyone acts like this is weird and inappropriate but i dont see the problem i even broke up with my boyfriend over it i dont understand what the big deal is and my parents are unhappy im going on a road trip with him,human
475,partner refuses to accept break upthrow away account so i 31f and my partner 30m have been together for 9 years living together for 7 and have 3 children together oldest 9f 5m and youngest 2f for a bit of background he was diagnosed with adhd as a child and uses that and ibs as his excuse for not working for not being able to just get up and clean for not knowing how to do simple tasks properly etc and over the years i have put things in place to help with some of this for example a list of tasks that need doing daily or weekly and keeping very detailed recipes over the past few years or more i have been constantly trying to tell him im unhappy with how our relationship is telling him he spends more time on his xbox or pc talking to friends especially at night when the children are in bed this made me feel very alone and isolated especially when if i went out with friends he would message me after a few hours asking when im coming home and asking me not to be too long as he dont like going to bed alone sex life over the past few years has been practically non existant doesnt exactly put me in the mood when im cleaning around him and 3 children all day spending most evenings alone and he asks when he is ready for going to bed if i want to do things laterthese past few months have been trying to say the least  i tried telling him i wanted to end the relationship and ive had enough of living this way and dont want to xontinue but every time i try to break up with him he makes excuses and refuses to listenthe first time i tried to end things he cried and after 4 or 5 attempts to break up he made me agree to trying for another month when that didnt work he claimed i wasnt trying and decided lists of what we want in a relationship to try again and see if that worked again i tried telling him that it wasnt going to work and that it wasnt a good idea but he somehow made me agree to it anyway apparently it shows when your heart isnt in it and im still not trying enoughi have since tried for the third time to tell him i cant keep living like this and he tried subtly hinting he will hang and stab himself if i break up with him he wouldnt actually do it just to clarify it was an attempt at emotionally manipulating me but i wouldnt budge as much as ive tried to be firm and hold my ground  theres only so much i could do i cant forcefully kick him out as he will have nowhere to go and would end up living on the streets he is currently trying to find couples therapy never actually agreed to it he is basically taking it upon himself and im unsure what to do any more i feel like im going to be stuck in this purgatory hell of a nightmare for the rest of my lifetl dr living with partner of 9 years who refuses to listen and accept break up i feel trapped and dont know what to do,human

481,should my partner m22 and i 25f be communicating issues verbally instead of over textwhen im upset about something i prefer to type out what i want to say however sometimes i can only let my partner of nearly a year know how i feel through text its not because i cant talk to them its more so that i struggle to verbally express all that im feeling my words get muddled and i forget things so i never feel like ive expressed myself fully over text i can lay it out properly and revise it to make sure it is exactly what i want to say and not harsh or critical mostly because i have a tendency to be a bit too blunt we call after were long distance since july until mayjune to try and reconnect and discuss anything around it so we do then have verbal and distanced face to face time i guess im just worried that this will actually cause more disconnect im also worried that if i dont practice verbally expressing then ill never able to hes back in the country soon so im worried about how ill deal with issues that arise then will it be silly to still text even if were in the same house even if it helps me to expresstldr i express my feelings through text because i struggle to verbally articulate will this be a problem for our relationship,human
482,first love strugglesso forgive me as this will be a long post as i need to provide context to the story but i really do feel like i need some advice or even just to write this down to people who may understand where im coming from context incomingi was with my exboyfriend for nearly seven years from the age of 1724 who was my first boyfriend and love i loved him more than i ever thought possible we got on so well he was loyal honest ambitious funny we very rarely argued about anything and i really did think we were a great match as we balanced each others qualities out well im not saying he was perfect because who is by any means our families accepted each other as if we were their own and i thought that we did a great job of growing with each other throughout a key period of turning into proper adults then we went through a period in the last few months of our relationship where he was super withdrawn didnt want to spend any time together aside from sitting on opposite couches scrolling our phones and started spending more time at work despite me constantly asking if he was ok and being reassured that he was and that he was just stressed at work too planning fun date nights for us and making our favourite meals in an attempt to bring us closer again he still seemed completely differenti realised that the stress of my job may have been taking a bit of a toll and i actually made the move to find a new job in the hope that this would bring some life back into our relationship in the end i ran out of things i could do to try and save what we had so i suggested we went on a break well he kind of left me no option as i was at the end of my tether and he was giving me nothing we lasted a week on the break and then we had a facetoface where he finally admitted to my face that he no longer loved meand on the first day of my new job we split up for goodit absolutely broke me to pieces and i honestly feel like ive never been the same since the reason for the breakup was something i had completely no control over i mean what do you say to that and i was very much still in love with him and truly thought id found my life partner and i love so deeply that it meant a lot to mehow im feeling nowthis was four years ago now ive been through multiple rounds of therapy to try and heal from all of this and whilst i do feel like im so much stronger and a completely different person to what i was four years ago i still hold such a candle for my ex and i really dont ever see it going away i havent really spoken to him since we broke up but i have seen him a couple of times at his parents house when i was visiting them and we literally just pick up talking and laughing like nothing has ever happened its so natural with us he also came to my grandads funeral last year as he had high respect for himi think about him regularly i really struggle to find a strong connection with other men ive been dating for years that goes anywhere in this day and age and i am also still close to his mother and father meanwhile he has since had two girlfriends but his mum still tells me hes completely different with them to how he was with me and doesnt seem as happy will i always feel this way it truly does feel like that sometimes and it really makes me feel like im completely stupid for holding onto a past relationship when hes so easily moving on and finding other people like i didnt exist what if he was my person and thats why i cant find a connection with anyone else i just thought that four years later id at least have made some kind of significant progress about this situation or at least be able to say that id moved on from it all  i know theres not really an answer but do you truly believe you can move on from a first love that was so seemingly easy amp right ive come to this place in the hope that someone is feeling or has felt anything remotely similar to my circumstance and if things ever changed for them right now i feel like ill feel like this forever    tldr  had a 7 year relationship from 1724 he fell out of love with me four years later im still really struggling to move on from my exboyfriend hes had 2 long term gfs since me and also find real connections with other men ive had none ive stayed single all this time has anyone else experienced this and can you ever truly move on from a first love when it was so easy amp you seemed like you were a perfect match really struggling to find a positive and just feel like ill feel like this forever,human

485,22m22f could someone with alot of experience please give me your advicei consider anything type of cheating a deal breaker emotional or physical for contextlong story short me and my gf met on on tinder after we met we deleted tinder she told me i was the only guy she was talking to at the moment and i asked when the last time she talked to one guy she mentioned and she said its been months reallydidnt think much of it but then a month into our relationship we have misunderstanding about her texting someone she said she didnt text a guy back but in reality after she said that she did and didnt tell me  was some dude she was friends with in highschool and said he was a weird dude that used to hit on a bunch of girls and i got upset and told her that was weird and she blocked him and a month later i figure out she just felt bad and texted him backbecause i didnt know that i went through her phone and discovered that dude in the beginning that said she didnt really text on months texted her 4 days after we got together and said if youre ever in atlanta you should visiting and she said hell ye i will and thats what was said then a few weeks later he drunkenly texted her youre a good friend and she responded huh what and i looked backed and they miscellaneouslly texted a couple times a month before we got together  after i pointed out there chat the next day she chat was deleted but she didnt know that iwent through her phone oh and apparently they hung out once and apparently it went terrible  6 months before we got together according to her they only ever seen each other as friends and neither wanted anything more i then truth tested her to see if she would tell me what they talked about and she said everything except the part where he said the atlanta thing and what she said oh and befire our first date she told him how excited she was to to go on a date with me and refered to me as  a close friend  before we were together i told her what she did was very inappropriate and awful so she ended up blocking him and apologizing to mewell i then check her phone again and went down her recently added on snapchat and found a guy who was added but not showing up on the snapchat feed  i do gotta admit i have seen her snapchat glitch and show people but this guy had a snascore unlike the other so that means they were friends so i accused her of deleting it and shes says that shes never deleted anything else after that one time because she understood how much it hurt me but on the data it said delete add then another delete because i deleted him long story short i checked her data and discovered in the first month of us being together she blocked 6 guys and i only was aware of 4 and i asked who they were and she said she didnt didnt remembernow she has been abused by her father and been in a toxic relationship  before and has bad memory so i dont know if that effects anythinglong story short me and my gf have been together 8 months and after we got together i found a something written that said im glad we me we started talking again but it had a different guys name i know it was written before we started dating but it still kinda hurt then yesterday  after we been together for 8 months  i found the dudes instagram and they werent following each other but i found a like on a post of his  from 10 days before we got together and i kinda flipped out on my gf and told her a bunch of things i said she was a lair accused her of possibly cheating and how i was probably just a little rebound and how she probably was just using me and that she better not have messaged him at all while weve been togetheri dont remember seeing a text chat from him but its 10 days before we got together so i accused her of deleting the chat so i asked to see her instagram data to which she replied yeah  she was at work  then when we see each other she was like  you didnt even listen or consider how i felt during all those awful things you said and bursted out crying lecturing me on how badly i hurt her feelings and how i need to be more considerate and how she didnt like me comparing her to my ex and how she was mad at me and how toxic it was to request this  of her i told her it was sus that she would call it toxicshe then explain why its disrespectful to her even though we have an open phone policy for this said it reminded her of her dad and moms toxic relationship of what i did we get home and basically she locked herself in the bathroom and vomits cause she so stressed so i threatened to message the guy if she didnt let me see and she came out and said i was being unnecessaryand i was like oh so you must be hiding something then we had a huge conversation about how she doesnt want to be toxic and wanted me to be the man she married one day but what i was doing was toxic and she was scared of that and explained she lost a bit of respect for me and that she doesnt wanna break up but for me to reflect on my actions and treat her better for what i did and how i should just trust her i then said yeah i trust you and she was like  no you think you do but you really dont or else you wouldnt be asking something toxic like this then one day i was going through her instagram comments and there was a comment that said hows your dasy going and the account was deleted so i accused her of commenting on his account and deleting it in which she says thats literally crazy then i asked her one day if the comment was still there and she was like idk i guess when people delete their accounts it delets the comment and i was like why didnt you tell me it was deleted and she was like idk i didnt think it was important was nothing was a girls account ive never seen her comment on a guys account though so idk if im just overthinking i have gone through snap before and did find she deleted him about a week before we met but i found the like on his post 3 days after we met  just met not together  she didnt comment on it  and from what i remember she said she unfollowed him before we got togetherits been rough these past couple days because of this she says that she would never do anything to hurt me and shes never done anything else since the first deletion because she seen how bad it hurt me shes a really sweet girl and after my last little breakout she suggested we delete social media and just focus on getting healthy like we used to be she immediately give some reassurance anytime i need it and says she never done anything bad to me ever and most of the stuff im saying is just blatantly incorrect and hasnt happened at all she does say that i tend to just believe only myself and not listen to whats hes saying i like this girl i just dont wanna not see something and be screwed over and not know

500,me f20 and this guy m20 are starting over again after he betrayed me is it worth itim with a guy and it hasnt been a year since weve been in this long distance set up i met him online through a friend and hes super sweet and really genuine our dynamics are super healthy and were always talking about how we feel so intimate even though were apartthese recent months had been challenging he expressed his doubts about himself if he could do the whole ldr thing especially this wasnt his preference and it was his first time to try because he really wanted me and he wants to work on something more serious with me something he hasnt done with anyone before we kept discussing for days how to make it work and then it was revealed hed been entertaining this girl he used to talk with before me but he explained to me that even since i came into the picture he doesnt have feelings for her he was never intimate or serious with her too in the first place and hed been trying to ignore her but the girl had always been insistent with sticking with him he found it hard to confront her and he even told her lies that he and i were just friends just so she wouldnt freaak out but when he talked to me about this he assured me he was going to confront her for real and showed me their conversation telling the girl hes sorry he hadnt been honest and that he felt nothing towards her and that he wants to fix things with me and pursue me again now that hes come clean he assures me that he never considered her an option that he has always been certain with me and doesnt have these tendencies to entertain others there was just something that was left unresolved with the girl that he couldnt confront i can tell how his attention has always been with me but he clearly had issues with the accountability with the girl before telling me we both plan on starting over for real and for him to pursue me with real commitment i believe him because thats how much security hes given to me during those months i believe this because i know making an ldr work for the first time is hard were currently taking a few days off so i can process this and that he can have time to reevaluate and then wed start againof course i am deeply hurt so angry he managed to keep her from me behind my back all those months this is the only and one time he hurt me but im giving this a second chance because hes apologized sincerely and we both can see that this is worth it because i believe him our next goal is to make a game plan on how to make this endgame and hes more than down to do it he says he will prove to me over and over that he wont put this second chance to waste im not one to trust easily which is why i want to believe im doing a valid thing ive never been happier with anyone else and its a relief to me to know he meant everything he did and said to mebut is this okaytldr he betrayed my trust but he is trying his best right now to assure me he will help me heal through this to start new,human

510,an engaged woman f27 kept asking my f27 boyfriend m31 to dance at a weddingmy boyfriend never danced with her but around the 5th time she asked he said there will be plenty of opportunities for us to go swing dancing this was his version of shutting it down this woman and him made out together 5 years ago and have been facebook friends she was also clearly neglecting her fianc all night to talk to us at the end of the night around 1am she texted my boyfriend so good to see you tonightmy boyfriend showed me right away and promised not to text her back he promised i did not ask him to do this but the next day he texted her back and said good to see you and your fianc tooim furious i think he should have shut her down a lot harder the second time she asked him to dance and i feel completely betrayed that he texted her back at my request he unfriended her on facebook but during the conversation i also found out he lied about the number of sexual partners hes had 3050 instead of 2030 i feel like he needs to build back trust but he thinks im overreacting a lot am itldr an engaged woman who made out with my boyfriend 5 years ago kept asking my boyfriend to dance and he didnt shut it down the way i thought he would,human
511,things didnt work out between me 23m and my friend 23f would it be wise to ask her to be friends with benefitsive known this girl for 5 months and i was attracted to her from the get go we quickly became good friends and my feelings for her were very clear and she started giving me mixed signals we saw each other every day and we were very physical as far as regular friendships go a month ago we went out for drinks and i made my attraction clear but she said she was confused she said she didnt know if she wanted to be commited into a relationship and when she asked me if by chance i would accept to be into a sexual relationship while still being friends i told her not because i saw her in another way and i wanted us to be serious i told her i would wait for her to understand her feelings and that we would still be friends meanwhilein the two weeks that followed the tension between us became so obvious that it was painful at times i needed to stop myself from trying to kiss her when we were constantly flirting and cuddling because i had told her i would wait for her then two weeks ago i just had to ask her if she was still confused she was she said she knew she would regret it rejecting me but she was so confused and she had lots of fears of not being understood coming from her past relationships even though she knew i was so different from her past boyfriends and she basically said it was over when we said goodbye she started crying when i asked her if she was ok she turned and left me there it didnt feel rightwe didnt see or hear from each other for three days and i was feeling miserable until i asked her to talk and she basically told me she had missed me and she decided to give it a try and see how it went we kissed and for the next three days we would see each other and it was nice we just made out btw but i quickly realized i dont know why but i didnt have those feelings for her anymore just when i started worrying about hurting her by telling her she became really distant and a week later she told me she couldnt see me as a boyfriend and we broke up i told her how i felt too and we stayed friends we still see each other frequently but even though the physicality between us is no more i am still very attracted to her sexually and from her looks i think shes too at this point after everything thats happened i think just asking if she wants a sexual relationship without commitment couldnt hurt our friendship but i dont know if our past could come biting us in the ass i dont want a serious thing right now but i think i might be the confused one now which is weird because i usually know what i want what to you thinktldr me and my friend started a relationship that lasted 1 week after months of going back and forth neither of us wants a serious thing but were still in very good terms and she talked about being friends with benefits two weeks before we got together should i ask her if she wants that even if we have been romantically involved albeit for a very short time,human

520,anyone else deal with emotionally unavailable mentldr should i continue to wait for him or is he never going to want a relationshiplong story so i 27 female have been recently talking to a guy 25 male for about 34 months now he lives many states away from me and we have never met in person when we first started talking it was a lot of getting to know each other and the spark for one another was definitely there such as he would even send me morning amp goodnight texts everything was going great for the first couple months we even spoke about the idea of meeting up sometime in august he agreed and said would take time off of work voluntarily offered and show me around i was like great i occasionally travel for work and coincidentally my job wanted me to travel out to his state when i brought it up in conversation i would be traveling for work and possibly staying the weekend he immediately freaked out amp said he was not ready to meet for xyz reasons and proceeded to tell me he needs more time amp yeah i was understanding and said its okay amp that i wasnt expecting to put that type of pressure on him even though i never mentioned at all that he should see me during that tripafter that we didnt speak for a few days amp the way we texted changed and instead of making convos through text he send reels through ig to make small convo and thats as far as we get occasionally i have a side hustle which lets me have more privacy then at home we will call each other and speak for hours at a time 36 hours and just recently started face timing each other and talk on phone or ft till we fall asleepgetting to know him has sure been a ride i was not ready for but yet there is something about him that fascinates me he is smart hilarious pure sings sweet and at times a big mush but man does he put on a tough exterior for everyone else he has had previous bad relationships amp last time he was in one was 25 years ago he always asks for my opinions says things that he questions himself about after i said that thats unlike me my take is he is emotionally unavailable due to his history although he says he would rather stay away from love and is scared of loving someone and that the idea of love fades away with time no matter who you are and getting hurt he has closed himself off to the idea of being in a relationship but then he does things like facetime me when hes at work talking to me till his battery dies with no charger while having 68 hours left in his shift which completely catches me off guard when he does stuff like thisme being me my ass overthinks but its almost as if i am slowly growing on him and he doesnt know it or maybe he does and hes guarding his feelings i dont pressure im patient and let him be the free spirit he is since im aware he likes his independence and freedom i have feelings for him but if i tell him my suspicion is he will run help thoughts am i crazy for thinking he wants something more and that i should wait for him,human
521,i 21f feel sexually not enough for my bf 25m and it makes me sadi feel like im going fucking crazy so hear me out my bf and i have sex every day and often multiple times a day i always thought i satisfy him enough but almost every time i leave the house for like an hour before he goes to work or i come back he still needs to masturbatewatch porn he also asks beforehand when i will leave it seems to me like hes just waiting till i leave although i always ask him if he still needs something sexually and he says no it would hurt but thank you it would probably not bother me like that if he wouldnt leave his fucking tissues all around his entire room its a very distinguished smell so i smell it directly if i enter his room or when i pick them up to throw them away if i ask him why he says theyre old they are literally wet i know he watches porn and we already had several fights that left me feel insecure although i was okay with it in the beginning and watched some even but looking into the industry im very disgusted by it and cant enjoy it what most shocked me were the several child r cases and revenge porn so i dont really understand why people still watch and support it nevertheless i said it was okay if it happens in a discrete way and i dont now it every time he watches it but obviously i know because his tissues are everywhere i read other men opinions on why they are still watching in a happy relationship and the main reasons were my sex drive is higher than hersthat is not the case if she is away for a long timeim away for an hour and we had sex beforehand if shes not in the moodwas never the case when i asked him why he does that he says that all men need variety and that one woman is just not enough he also said that if porn wouldnt exist he would probably cheat to get this variety that fucking blows my mind and makes me feel very insecure and not enough when i asked if we could just record or own porn he said it would be boring because he needs variety and needs different women when hes masturbating when we talked about it he also said he doesnt save it because thats what i was afraid of but recently he had some recorded ones on his desktop very blatantly i didnt snoop  dont want to hurt myself there were just there on his front page so now i know that he actually screenrecords them and saves them in a very secured way i would never get to see because its password protected makes me wonder what crazy shit he watches if it has that big emotional value for him that he needs to collect it and hide it i also asked if we could recreate whatever it is but he said thats not possible its not hentai or anime the porn on his desktop was so normal shit but okay so now im getting incredibly insecure every time i leave the house because why am i still not enough for you why do you need other women when you have pics and videos of meus what is this crazy kink no one can ever know abouttldr feeling not enough for my bf because of his constant porn consumption,human
522,i 25 m am having a dating quandaryfor the last 6 years of my dating life i have dated with very little thought or preference to religion ive always held the opinion that as long as my partner let me practice my faith it wouldnt be an issue ive had quality relationships but continually seem to meet people not ready for longterm commitment ive been either an undergrad or grad student that whole time and dated mostly other students ive been getting frustrated with the apparent lack of commitment and generally just the dating pool a close friend of mine suggested i start to date catholic girls more purposefully honestly the early returns have been great they generally share similar values and are more ready for the longterm commitment im looking forhowever there has appeared a quandary many of these girls are more guarded in respect to sex i have some kinks that i want a significant other to be open to but for many of the girls ive dated talking about any sex itself is almost taboo it definitely makes me concerned that my kink wont be accepted which leads me to my quandary do i return to dating a more general pool that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with or do continue dating the catholic girls and hope one of them will just be more accepting im really interested in what you would do with this same problemtldr do i return to dating a more general pool that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with or do continue dating the catholic girls and hope one of them will just be more accepting,human

530,my sister 13 wants to live with me f29 but a teacher almost died at the school shes supposed to go to and im a mess whos never had kids beforei moved across the country away from my entire family recently i offered to let my sister live with me because her grades were really bad from lack of disciplineattention at home not realizing what i was signing up for ive been helping her with schoolwork for the last few months but it basically boiled down to me doing all of her schoolwork for her every day and parenting her over the phone because she wouldnt listen to anyone else in our familymy feelings really shifted after she yelled at me when i asked her to explain what she learned in one of her classes she said why do i have to explain it to you i already did the school work in class i dont want to do it and i said you failed all of your tests last semester you got fs in everything so i need to make sure you understand what you were taught in class this was after i wrote many essays for her gave her answers to so many assignments she didnt turn in and helped her cram all night for a test she failed to mention until a day before i had to reteach everything her teachers taught her and do her homework for her on top of all of my responsibilities it was really stressing me out because i had just moved across the country alone when ive never lived on my own before i had my first mortgage car payments quarterly taxes im self employed expensive tech issues related to my work declining health i had an injury last year im still recovering from plus obesity issues and i struggled all my life with anxiety around doing everyday things which is why it took so long for me to move out on my ownthat incident where the student nearly beat a teacher to death in florida happened at the high school my sister is supposed to enroll in so i told my mom we have different moms that she may not be safe because of how poorly the staff and police handled that situation my mom says to let my sister decide because she wants me to take care of my sister the school in my sisters area has never had a violent incident like that occur so i know shell be fine since our other sister graduated from there my sister will probably still choose to live with me anyway but besides my personal feelings im not sure if we should let her go to a school where the staff were so slow to help a woman getting her skull bashed in and the police just let the attacker walk off theres another school in the same country about 20 mins away but the ratings for that school are worsehonestly reteaching my sister everything and doing her homework for her over the next 4 years while trying to get her to sleep and wake up on time teach her to practice basic hygiene buy her whatever she needs limit her social mediagaming time cook for her take her to doctordentist appointments drive her wherever she needs to go get her to exercise emotionally support her etc might not be something i can handle since i can barely do it for myselfwhen i offered to take her in i thought id just figure it out and be okay with taking care of someone elses child because im childless i thought id be okay with dying alone without ever getting married or having children of my own but now that ive had more time to consider it im not so sure ive never been on a date before because of a lot of past traumamental health issues and just being more picky than i deserve to be so maybe kids arent in the cards for me but id like to figure that out sooner and later because of the health risks that come with waiting too longim on the fence since it was my idea in the first place and my sister has shown improvement it would be good to see her become a happier and productive person though i cant help but think about how her family has always shamed me and talk shit about me because i was a depressed unhealthy unemployed shut in for many years and now that i managed to pull myself out of that dark period of my life they want me to undo the problems they caused for my sister she has parents a grandmother grandfather aunts uncles older sister and brother at home yet theyve given up on her theyve already managed to establish their own families so they think it doesnt matter if i focus on someone elses kid instead of figuring out if i want to get married and have kids of my own while im still healthy and able to i realize it was my idea to offer to let her live with me in the first place but i didnt think too deeply about the situation before making a decision and i kind of regret acting so hastily and being so short sighted on the other hand i dont expect to meet a guy any time soon because of the decline of relationships people arent having kids at they rate they used to anymore and there are a lot of people that dont value marriage anymore seeing how apathetic people have become worries me i also want to lose weight firstimprove my appearance and get my life together so my sister being with me for a year might be okay as long as she respects me and the rules of my home im so torn on this i dont know what to dotldr i offered to let my sister move with me across the country not realizing how much responsibility taking care of someone elses child would be the school shes supposed to enroll it was on the news recently for an attack on a teacher and im not sure what to do because im a mess,human

534,what should i 24f do about the intense painjealousy i feel when i think about the fact that my boyfriend 21m sometimes has sexual thoughts about other womeni realize that most people have sexual thoughts about people other than their partners however from what ive heardread men generally seem to have these thoughts frequently when theyre out and about in their day to day life my boyfriend of six months has confirmed that he also sometimes has thoughts of this nature he says that he prefers not to and chooses not to stare at attractive strangers or think disrespectfully for some reason i cant handle this idea very well its not that im worried hes going to cheat on me  im not its specifically an issue with the thoughts themselves it makes me feel like other women have power in regards to himour relationship that they dont have the right toi dont want them to have it brings up years of feelings of inferiority and insecurity in me when im single in a way i feel powerful and at peace because i know that many men both taken and single have thoughts about me but in a relationship i feel powerless because i cannot command the sexual attention of the only man whom i desire the attention of theres probably more to it as well maybe its very immature thinking thats leading me to have these feelings i dont mind if thats the case  im just trying to get to the bottom of it id like to clarify that im not being hypocritical i dont think about other men in a sexual way honestly thinking about this today got me so upset that i considered breaking us up of course that would probably be a mistake he is truly the man of my dreams apart from this very human habit i feel that ive found a unicorn and id be unlikely to find a guy like him again if we did break up and i eventually got over this hangup he told me that he would fight these thoughts and i told him that i would try not to think about them any more and that i wouldnt ask him about them either is that the right decision on my end im concerned that it wont be enough to keep my mind at peacetldr  i feel disproportionately negative emotions when i think about the fact that my boyfriend at least occasionally has dirty thoughts about other women i feel that i would regret breaking up with him and choosing a life of celibacy so how do i handle these feelings in a constructive way is trying not to worry about his thoughts enough,human

538,my 28f mother 60f hates my partner 30mmy boyfriend and i have been together for 2 years we have our flaws and we both are trying to work towards being better humans and being better for each other weve had our ups and downs in the relationship but we are happy together a few months ago we got into our biggest argument which a lot of it could have been avoided if i had less of a negative attitude and if he was willing to control his emotions and give me the space i needed instead things escalated  he screamed at me and he laid his hands on me i immediately grabbed my stuff and ran to my car so i could be alone i called my mom cried and told her about what happened my boyfriend realized what he did and recognized that he needed help with his anger and mental health and put himself into therapy immediately he grew up in a household with two parents who were always fighting and sometimes violent but he has said himself that he does not want to end up like them we have a lot of forgiveness in our relationship as long as we are able to acknowledge our mistakes and make the appropriate changes to be better ever since that incident my boyfriend has been actively trying to make changes in his life including addressing his mental health it was a wakeup call for him although its only been a few months ive noticed that hes been much calmer during our disagreements hes more cognizant of his emotions he gets less triggered when someone does something dumb on the road while the situation i was in a few months ago was a very scary and emotional event i eventually learned to forgive him after a few months of seeing the changes he has made to address his mental health and wellbeingmy mother on the other hand has done a 180 on him she never liked him since day 1 she hates him because of that one incident a few months ago every time i call her all she can ever talk about is how much she hates him pretty sure shes done a full background check on him but i dont see him as the type of person to have a criminal background or other red flags i dont feel the desire to call my mom anymore because it never feels productive shes just going to tell me that i need to leave him hes a violent person and he cannot be trusted i am a strong believer that people can change and ive seen that hes determined to work towards being a better person i also dont believe we should define someone solely from their worst moments my mom refuses to listen to me when i try to say good things about him or how hes doing well with therapy she doesnt believe in therapy she hates him so much that she cant even be in the same room as him shes protective of me but somehow i feel like she is trying to control my life i feel like i have to pick a side ive told my boyfriend about this but hes still willing to put up with itthe way im seeing it having a future with him means that my mom will panic every time they are around each other and they might start arguingyelling at each other this isnt ideal for me because i would prefer to be with someone who gets along with my family if we break up of course my mom is going to be overjoyed but i dont know if i would feel the same way in fact i wonder if i will learn to resent my mom but at the same time i wonder if she her intuition and wisdom are correct and he is not safe to be around considering she usually has a good track record for reading peopletldr boyfriend and i got into an ugly argument that led to him laying his hands on me cried to my mom about it and now anytime i call my mom she repeats herself about how much he hated him since day 1 and tells me to break up with him he recognized his mistake and is now in therapy to help him manage his emotion and mental healthwhat are your thoughts on this situation  do you think my mom is overreacting  or do you think mothers are almost always right and i should follow her intuition  if i keep this relationship going eventually marriage will my boyfriend and mother ever learn to be civil around each other  do you believe that people can change for the better  does one somewhat violent incident make you concerned about domestic abuse in the future,human

556,what did i do wrong this timetldr my close friend of four years contacted me again and was nice for a couple of days asked me if i was traveling to her part of the world this year and then ghosted me againhi alli had a huge fight with someone i thought was my close close friend its been about 7 months since our fight and she said she wasnt ready to talk about it the times i tried to reach out so i didnt press but i sent a text to ask how she is once a week and get a totally cold reply or no reply the thing is i know i acted poorly i felt like a doormat and neglected in this friendship for a very long time and lost my shit  which takes a lot for me to be pushed to doingso basically the summary as i wrote a long article and even i was bored reading my words this is long but the other was a novelampx200b friend and i met on tinder almost 4 years ago i was separated at the time and she didnt seem into me romantically because of this so i never pursued it over the course of time we became extremely close i thought and agreed to have the relationship where we shared secrets that we couldnt tell others ie the reason i was separated was my wife had a long affair with a friend and i couldnt handle it my friend told me her mom spoke to her and was worried about her being close to me due to my marital situation back then so i totally backed off my friend has lots of random guys she hooks up with but always said she doesnt like the emotions involved in a relationship so she prefers brief relationships she and i used to send lots of selfies to each other to stay close as we do not get to see each other due to the pandemic it started to be where she would disappear mid conversation and come back hours later to say goodnight or chat a bit before she slept i got into a car accident on new years eve and sent her a text saying i couldnt call her because of this and she didnt really talk for a few days as she felt i brought bad luck by telling her about my car accident on new year i had to ask and drag it out of her as i wasnt sure what id done wrong over the last year she had gotten mad at me and not talked to me for a week or so a few times before saying she realized she overreacted i always texted asking what was wrong and a couple times she said nothing but one time she sent me a long angry text about all the things wrong ive done and how it made her want to kill herself because i wrote her a message trying to explain why i sometimes seemed off i had realized early on i had some jealousy and had gotten past it so wanted to explain why i had reacted or acted poorly sometimes even though it was in the past as i had realized it with some self reflection i just wanted to apologize i felt awful about upsetting her some of them i hadnt realized but i felt so badly about this message as i thought i was doing the right thing owning up to my shortcomings she was cranky with me a lot earlier last year and i spoke up about it and we were ok for a few months like i used to send flowers when i thought she needed cheering up and one time the delivery guy woke her even tho i specified deliver at night and she was so cold just a thank you but it was a cold one she had been withdrawing more and more but still telling me i was the most important one to her and she loved me and called me sexy and hot a lot but stopped really confiding in me but always wanted me to be there whenever she was going to sleep as she liked to chat a bit then each day i noticed i was getting cranky and short with her and i tried to adjust myself as we are just friends i hated i got that way she hadnt been sending pics at all really so i pathetically asked for one on my birthday and she didnt send for almost a week but she was sending tons to other guys which is fine i am not bothered by guys just i guess i wanted to feel special on my day i know i know i found she hid a two year sexting relationship with a married man and i was upset because of the hidinglie and honestly she led me to believe we werent intimate because i was separated but i thought we were good as we had a long talk after and just everything seemed great the man was also the same ethnicity as the married man my wife cheated with with just sort of hurt deeply reopening that wound i really wouldnt have cared just hated being lied to again after swallowing the lie about the married dude i have some trauma around people from a certain country as my father used to lie and take trips with women from this country  but always said he was seeing friends my friend had said she didnt like them either so i reacted weirdly when she said she was talking intense and sexual with someone form there on tinder i regretted my reaction and apologized she told me no big deal as she wasnt talking to him or seeing him anymore she was planning this trip to a place she said she wanted to go with me as it was special to her and somewhere special to me neither of us had visited before because we are apart she recently said she was going with her other close friend which made me happy as he is very special to her as well it turned out she was going with the random guy she met on tinder and the friend was joining only part of the time and i shouldnt care as she had no feelings for him i found out a few hours before she was leaving i totally lost my shit which is rare and got angry and said some hurtful things because i felt bad about the hidinglying i dont get that angry easily or often so just didnt know how to deal with those emotions and said some mean things but looking inside i think i had been feeling neglected or ignored and then told how special i was all the time but the actions never matched the words and boy am i ashamed at the things that came out of my mouth it was out of line and i couldnt believe it was me saying them it was just pure emotion she told me i made her feel totally guilty of all the things shes done the last few years and that she didnt even want to go on the trip anymore that id ruined it she also said all she did was trigger me i feel so devastated that my anger and selfishness ruined her trip and made her feel bad about herself i never judged her lifestyle and i never will  everyone does things their own way i texted a week after saying i knew we both were hurt and that she needed space and i wasnt being silent to be a jerk just trying to respect what i felt she wanted i got a cold response of two words i tried to other times to ask how shes doing and got cold responsesilence except for one time she chatted me like everything was normal in november and then ghosted me againampx200b fast forward to a couple weeks back i finally had moved on but she sent some nice warm messages and i foolishly responded only to have her ghost me againampx200b shes still with the guy she met last summer im pretty sure  which is actually great i always hated she jumped from man to man always felt she deserved better and no i didnt think that person was meive been doing a lot of self analysis since then even going back to therapy as i just am devastated and cant sleep or eat i still miss her but i understand the shitty things i said were in the wrong i know this friendship is ruined because of me i normally am very open and direct but she doesnt like talking about feelings or emotions so she asked me not to and i did but it all built up i guessalso i know that when i feel someone is slipping away i can grasp too tight its not a good look on anyone the thing with me is as long as people are honest with me i dont panic its the unknown and lies that drive me a bit crazyi should add not that this excuses my outburst but i had some pretty horrific abuse as child and i know that it affects the way i am in relationships sometimes i always want to please but maybe this makes me toxic i really dont knowi just dont want anyone hurt over me ever again i know i can be weird and i guess i wanted more than i deserved with my friend i guess since my wife had hid so much and was never sexual with me i wanted someone at least who confided in mereally why would someone reach out and act friendly for a few days ask me if i am coming that way this year and then when i reply nicely ghost me and leave me on read again i dont understand what i did wrong,human

558,debating asking friend to hookuptldr i think friend and i are both attracted to each other debating asking to hookup or noti havent posted on here ever nor on reddit in the last while regardless im in a kind of weird position suddenly and could use some advicebasically i broke up with my boyfriend this past week over my college spring break it was a long time coming although the relationship itself was like 9 months long anyways so back at college i have this friend lets call him james because thats a very generic name james and i met when we were both in relationships which made me kind of ignore the behavior i otherwise would have assumed was flirting we have a lot in common including birthdays and appearances which means he sort of looks like my angry russian cousinto add to the list of things we have in common apparently is that he also ended a relationship over spring break these were not correlated events and i actually had no idea him and his partner were having problems anyways he texts me about this over break and when we get back on campus i invite him over to my place because im a curious person and needed details he gives me the rundown and i sort of give him mine he then tells me he had a dream we kissed which is just a really weird thing to tell your friend in my opinion but admittedly im like this is a really weird coincidence again because i had a similar dream on the same night he was just sitting there so i kind of was just like im not going to date you which is a very true statement and i just had to get it out there he gave an indication that he didnt mean to imply we were going to date and then we sort of just went to the bookstore and pretended that conversation didnt happenits true i dont have any interest in dating this friend or at least pursuing any sort of traditional relationship with him and thats frankly a really bad idea because we both just ended these other relationships what is true is that ive always been attracted to him and maybe thats a narcissistic thing because we look a little alike which is an important part of the whole problem imo but its true and i cant help but want to see if hes interested in a kind of fwb situationwhy im hesitant to go forward hell say no to advances and it will make things weird we hookup and its bad we hookup and its good friendship dies i end up dating my evil twinthis is a really annoying situation so any advice would be helpful and yes i know the best idea is probably to not do anything because there are a lot of reasons not to but i literally just want to and i think he also kind of wants to and if im lucky ill be transferring colleges next year and will never have to see him again also im an art student so admittedly i do want a weird erotic friendship to draw inspiration from none of this is ironic im just a really silly person thanks again,human
559,spending issuesive been dating a guy for 2 years and were a decent couple both in our mid 30s we love each other but i have a problem im culturallybehaviorally inclined to prefer the guy to spend on me as the woman nothing lavish but occasional dates he does not like this even though he begrudgingly accepts to take me out sometimes he likes splitting were in our mid thirties it feels childish for me to have to debate him over this yet weve had this talk and he thinks we should be 5050 on spending he makes more than me his father is also like him i personally think women more to lose in a relationship and one way to show commitment is through financial investment and its just more attractive to me than splitting am i crazy what should be my standard here please dont attack me i simply want to see how to think about this issue in a wise way i would appreciate your wisdomtldr my bf doesnt like to spend on me and i have a problem with that,human

566,my 33m wife 33f and my parents early 60s mf dont get along and playing the middle man is pushing me to the breaking pointi apologize if this is coming off as a bit long winded but im at a big crossroads with this issue between my wife and my parentsfor basically the entirety of our time together 5 years married 9 years together my wife has disliked my parents my wife is very sensitive and can take things very personallyblow things out of proportion my parents who are definitely not without blame in this can be a bit hard to deal with my mom is to be honest a bit of a narcissist shes the kind of person that just isnt super warm and can say things without a filter and kind of makes things all about herself to be honest its something ive been aware of but until i met my wife i never realized what a problem it was i think that over time ive just kind of dealt with it and just wrote off her behavior as thats just mom being mom but with my wife being so sensitive ive gotten better at calling my mom out on her behavior though i admit i dont do it as much as i shouldsome other important facts that will be relevant later on my wife and i live about seven hours away from my parents i have two brothers both of them live four hours from our parents but in different cities my wifes parents live about 20 minutes away from us and we see them oftenmy wife has high anxiety around seeing my parents honestly its mostly my mom she and my wife are just like oil and water as i kind of touched on earlier part of the reason is that my mom has a history of saying some unkind things to her and i admittedly wasnt great about standing up for her its something that ive gotten better at but theres still some anxiety on my wifes part id bring up the topic of my parents visitingus visiting them once every 34 month or so and usually it would start a big fight id say about half of the time my wife would agree to see them we kind of came to an agreement when my wife said she only wanted to see them a few times a year i agreed mostly for the sake of keeping the peace but wed still get into arguments when i brought up seeing them my wife and i have talked about putting up boundaries with my parents which im working on and i think im doing an okay jobour daughter was born two andahalf years ago i had always assumed perhaps hopefully that my parents would change their ways when they became grandparents i had great relationships with my grandparents on both sides and was hoping that our daughter would have the same with my parentshowever it hasnt been quite like that while they havent been unkind theyre not the kind of grandparents i was hoping theyd be for example they rarely ask about our daughter unprompted when we facetime them theyll talk with our daughter for a few minutes then go offi to talk about their own thing it always feels like they want to be grandparents but on terms that work for them i also think it hasnt helped that my wifes parents who see our daughter often are the complete polar opposite of my parents theyre your typical lovey dovey grandparentsin the first year of our daughters life my wife had a tough time with ppd as such i didnt really push the topic of my parents visiting with her or them fortunately due to covid i was able to kind of push off their requests to visit usonce covid kind of let up in the spring of 2021 they came down to visit us a few times it was okay my parents didnt really interact with out daughter like we hoped they played with her a little but they just seemed interested in working on their laptops and playing on their phones my wife and i were both upset as to how that trip went a few weeks after that we went to visit them at their house but we had to leave early because our daughter got sick when we left my parents seemed upset with us and kept saying oh shes not sick she can stay she seems fine which bothered my wife and ithings then were okay for a few months we saw my parents a few times but it was mostly at big events weddings anniversary parties so they didnt have much 11 interaction with our daughter the last time they saw our daughter in person was for her birthday party it felt like my parents didnt spend as much time with our daughter as they did with our niece their other granddaughter while i was a little hurt by it but didnt say anything to them to keep the peace my wife was completely disraughtsince then things between my parents and my wife havent been great theyve been acting the same theyll ask about her intermittently and do the same thing when were on facetime theyve asked me a few times about coming down to visit but when i bring it up to my wife her response is no i dont think theyve earned the right to visit my wife is of the mind that having a relationship with your grandkids is something thats earned not given while i agree to an extent and i dont think that my parents have earned a free pass on everything i do think that we could stand to foster a bit more of a relationship with them but my wife wont have itthings have come to a head when my parents have been trying to plan a week long vacation with us my brothers and their spouses for some context my wife and i go to the beach for a week with her family as do my brothers with their respective inlaws my parents wanted to also book a vacation house with us partly because they want to spend time with us but also because i think theyre jealouswhen i brought it up with my wife it started a minor fight we ended up compromising that we wouldnt go for the whole week because she didnt want to spend that much time around my parents rather wed just go for four days i was worried about the optics of how that would look to my parents but fortunately neither of my brothers and their families could come for the whole week eitheri texted my parents to let them know that wed only be going for four days and shit totally hit the fan i received a text from my mom saying how sad and frustrated they are at how they havent built the relationship with our daughter that they want to and that they were hoping to spend the entire week with her she also added that they keep wanting to come to see us but i keep pushing them away my mom then went on to say how she never had a relationship with her grandmother my mom is an immigrant so she never met her grandmother as she came from her country of orgin and that she would be sick if our daughter had the same relationship she then went on to say how all three of her sons had great relationships with our grandparents and we my parents never stood in the way of those relationshipsanyways im just at my wits end with this i cant exactly say well mom a big reason why i keep dodging your visits is because my wife hates you and your visits cause her massive anxiety i feel like ive been able to put up this charade to them that everything is fine but this feels like a house of cards thats about to fall over honestly i just want everyone to get along and i hate that both my mom and my wife are upset at me but both sides just keep digging their heels further into the ground and i have no idea what to do here to keep the peacetldr my wife and my parents dont get along my parents want to come to visit us and build a relationship with our daughter my wife feels that they havent earned the right to do so but my parents dont like that i keep denying their visits but i cant tell them why my wife doesnt want them visiting,human

577,am i missing obvious hintsa few months ago during my uni holidays i 20m got messaged fully out of the blue by this girl lets call her 20f i knew from school who i hadnt talked to since we were last in school 2 years before she just asked how ive been and if i wanted to go for coffee sometime and i was like sure not thinking anything of it since i had quite a few classes with her back in school so we definitely werent strangers to each other or anythingwe catch up over coffee and again im thinking completely nothing of it and as we leave shes like hopefully see you soon even then though i figured shes just being friendly and wanted to stay in touch a bit more often than every 2 years lmaofast forward to a couple of weeks later im out for lunch with one of my long time close family friends who also happens to be 20fs best friend at some point in the conversation she randomly mentions oh by the way 20f is free to hang out this weekend and doesnt say anything else about it for the rest of the lunchso i figure ill message 20f cos shes good company and we go out again should specify all these in the story are lunches no dinners or whatever and at the end she asks if im free next weekend at this point im kinda wondering if shes interested in dating but she could easily just wanna be friends toowe go out the next weekend but then were both busy for a while and dont meet again for almost a month with only kinda occasional messagingbut then in this between period my mum and close family friends mum go out for lunch which is pretty standard for them what isnt standard is that family friends mum talks to my mum about me and 20f as you can imagine im pretty confused why my friends mum would know since ive barely even mentioned it to my mum cos i didnt think it was anything important lol this is when i start questioning whether shes interested or not since why would our mutual close friends mum know weve been hanging out if it was just as friendsso fast forward to the next time me and 20f meet and it goes more or less the same as the previous couple of times as were leaving we both agree we should hang out more regularly during uni but nothing in our interaction that would suggest anything more than good friendssince then weve met up when weve been free and its basically the same pattern with only occasional messaging etc though i guess we know each other a bit better now so convos flow some morebasically am i missing some obvious hints from my pov id say im interested in her romantically but im also happy with being friends and so i dont really wanna ruin that and make things awkward if she doesnt feel the same waytldrgirl i knew from school messages out of nowhere asking to catch up and i thought nothing of it kinda mixed signals from there due to things i heard from mutual friend unsure whether or not shes interested romantically or simply wants to be friends,human

591,my 27m best friend 26f doesnt think we can be friends anymore or at least for a while and i dont understand whyso some backstory we met when we both were juniors in college i developed feelings for her after like a year and asked her out she said she couldnt be more than just friends with me for some reasons that i cant say here but they are pretty static and still havent changed i really was heartbroken and needed some space from her and told her that 34 months pass and i felt like i moved on so i told her that i missed our friendship and wanted to see if we could pick back up which she said yes to we both eventually moved to different states but still talk every day from good morning until goodnight we both sleep super late so usually just stay up texting each other fast forward to about a week ago and we went on a trip together we booked the 1 room with 1 bed which i admittedly didnt think would be an issue and neither did she both of us are pretty introverted so we stayed in a lot and just watched tv together in bed on the day before we left i wasnt feeling well so i asked her if i could cuddle and she said yes so we cuddled while watching tv for a couple hours before going to bed the day after we say our goodbyes and leave separately she seemed a bit bothered the day we left but i figured she was just tired because we slept super lateoverall i thought the weekend was really fun and i loved spending time with her again as it it had been so long we were laughing joking having a great time and nothing seemed weird really until the morning we left like i mentioned when i got home however i got a voicemail from her saying that she thinks were too close and that we cant be friends and so she wants to go no contact for a while i called her up and told her that i respect what she wants and that im always here whenever she thinks we can be friends again its been all of like 4 days and im definitely not handling it well she was my best friend and a huge part of my support system for dealing with stuff like this now i feel super alone and i miss her more than i thought i could and every little thing reminds me of her i feel like complete shit and my chest physically hurts when i think of her im now a mix of confused and sad and i dont know how to deal we went from literally talking every day throughout the day to not talking at all because were too close i wouldve thought that we could just set limits for how much we talk if she thinks were too close because we already live in different states anyways but she thinks we need to go full no contact and i guess i dont understand why am i missing something here i want to give her the space shes asking for but what if she doesnt reach out i wanted to wait like 34 weeks and then reach out to her to see if we could be friends again is that selfish of me to ask i would appreciate any help tldr best friend and i took a trip together which went well i thought we shared a bed and cuddled for a little and now she says were too close and says we need to go no contact for an unspecified time whats going on,human

matters jake and i are far from equally yoked jake has no education after high school and he had a hard time holding down a job when he had one it was always waiting tables i work in tech and im quickly approaching making 3 times as much as he used to as a waiter he makes very little right now because he is unemployed which i will explain more lateri hit dating apps and i met harvey like with jake we had a lot of fun together he makes almost twice as much as me so it was a different kind of fun the tables turned in a big way from jake to harvey hes very tall and attractive that along with his income meant he could be selective in dating he made me feel like miss rightnow instead of miss right a lot of the time he could be very critical of both himself and others he also had a bit of a drinking problem and when he got drunk he would voice the things he wished were different about me he said i had a pretty face but he wanted me to be thinner and more muscularathletic he didnt take much interest in my hobbies he was a man who knew what he wanted who was disinterested in other things the reason we broke up is because he broke up with me without actually meaning it 3 times he often made me feel disposable and unimportant with that said he was very affectionate and cuddly he was generous and always honest to a fault sometimes harvey and i were best friends i called him my twin flame separate we were candles burning bright but together we were a raging bonfire both in tech we developed software together he coached me to snag a huge raise and i coached him to develop a game my favorite thing about him was that he was always growing and changing he always wanted to be a better version of himself in the future and i love that energythe sex wasnt good it was almost clinical i had a much higher drive than him so i was always hungry for him but came away feeling a unsatisfied when hed throw me a bone lol when we broke up i was actively setting up appointments with a sex therapist to try and have more passion in our relationshipwhen harvey and i broke up his world his walls and ego came crashing down he didnt realize until i was really gone how much i meant to him he misses me terribly and would do anything to win me backafter harvey and i broke up i thought i wonder how jake has been i had wondered this many times but harvey wasnt comfortable with me making contact and i respected that completely i asked him once and never brought it up again this time i could actually reach out and ask well as it turns out we never got over each other it clicked just as easily as the first timenow i have 2 men that literally want to marry me a few months ago jake had a massive family tragedy and broke his 2 year sobriety until he started outpatient rehab he just graduated and i believe he will have another job waiting tables or working in a nursing home in a couple weeks he plans to start community college after that the most important development for him is that he was diagnosed with bipolar 1 after we broke up and he has spent the last couple years perfecting his medication regimen with his doctor the mania is under control but he has a lot of catching up to do before hes ready to settle down hes done the emotional work and now he has the financial work in front of himharvey is the complete opposite he has done all the financial work and he has a lot of emotional work in front of him hes doing the work too hes in an anger management group as well as hes seeing a psychiatrist his normal therapist and a hypnosis specialist  he stopped drinking he realizes his shortcomings and has been obsessively working on themi broke up with harvey 2 months ago and reconnected with jake 1 month ago it is far too early to make a decision but ultimately i do think i will wind up spending my life with one of them i know they will both wait unless i tell them explicitly there is no chance we will ever get back together what should i look out for on what do i base my decision i feel like financial stability and intimate connection are both pretty important things for me in a partner is it wrong for me to be seeing jake right now weve limited our contact to 1week phone calls and every 4th week we meet up in person still i wonder if its immoral would it be wrong for me to have a similarly distant relationship with harvey at the same timei really want to do the right thing both for myself and for each of these men that i really do love and care for deeply please dont judge me too harshlytldr  two of my exes harvey and jake are both madly in love with me harvey is financially in a good place but he has some work to do on himself emotionally jake has done more emotional work and needs time to develop financial stability how do i decide between them and how should i conduct myself in the mean time to not string them along,human

615,how do i 24m have a productive conversation with my gf 24f about her finances when she struggles to do difficult thingstldr gf is in a bad financial place with jobs im in a good spot and i dont know how to give her advice because she has a hard time doing difficult thingsmet a year ago we dont live together we dont have shared finances im currently 3 hours away doing an internship where im making 30hr and dont have rent she works at a preschool making 1450 im in a comfortable financial situation in terms of habits awareness and savings she has next to no savings lives paycheck to paycheck and is constantly in a stressful financial situation anytime an unexpected expense comes up or she has to miss work her current pickle is that her family has a trip to her dads home country and her work said they cant give her the 11 days off even though she requested it 3 months in advance when she was told she cant have the time off she said okay i wont go then i cant really afford to miss that much work anyways  also side note it seems like she was denied having these dates off because too many people had requested it off but then found out later someone else was given the same time off after he request was denied her mom said that she has to go the plane tickets are already bought that if my gf doesnt go she owes her mom 1000 for the ticket which is a bit silly because her parents are wealthy 1k is pocket change to them but its more than my gfs rent so my gf was trying to figure out what to do for weeks and kept putting off talking to her boss about how shes in a tough spot and needs to take the time off she said she would send an email explaining that if she cant get the time off she would have to quit to avoid owing her mom 1000 she procrastinated sending the email for weeks and its still not sent long story short her mom finally said that my gf can go or not go it doesnt matter and she wont owe any money for the ticket so that weight is off her shoulders a bit but all of this made her realize how shitty her job is she loves the work loves the kids but the pay isnt good and the fact that she has such a struggle with her boss regarding time off another side note my gf gets sick semi regularly due to being around kids and last time she could hardly breathe and didnt want to get the kids sick and she called in to work the boss asked her what her symptoms were and trying to convince her to come in because they didnt have enough people so even though shes off the hook with this trip as far as the ticket goes she still feels she needs to find a different job and she still cant afford to take nearly 2 weeks off from work not to mention shell probably have to pay for stuff on the trip itself like food and whatnot its worth mentioning that my gf has an incredibly hard time doing difficult things i dont know anything about adhd but she says thats the cause she stopped going to school after about a year and says shes bad at school and doesnt want to go back she refuses to do any budgeting she says my system works for me yet for example she had a 17 subscription shes been paying for since 2021 that she just saw so clearly shes not very aware of her finances shes had in the year ive known her probably 5 different oh shit i can afford gas or groceries or bills but not all three moments one time her parents had to help her pay for stuff yet each time these moments occur she doesnt make any major changes to avoid it happening the next time shes talked about getting a new job when these things happen but then doesnt continue she says she cant handle a desk job but knows that the type of job she has now interacting with kids doesnt pay enough in essence shes constantly in a tight spot financially but each time she gets out of it continues on in more or less the same way so we plan on talking about this trip dilemma later today on the phone because shes really not sure what to do i really dont know what to tell her my advice each time shes in a tough spot is essentially to suck it up research good paying jobs she could go to school for humble herself and ask her parents to help support her in this journey by paying for school or letting her move back in or something i think this could work because her dad has quite literally told her that she needs to try harder its clear he wants effort out of her above all else he has savings for both of his children im sure he would be okay with her using that for improving her situation by getting an education i say this a bit more diplomatically to her but this is putting it all bluntly i see school as the best long term avenue although it doesnt solve her immediate crisis but that fact that she has crises all the time means something needs to be done but im also biased towards school because thats what has led me to the place where im at which is quite comfortable i also encourage her to start budgeting to become aware of her finances but she refuses im not sure what i can say to her when we discuss this later all the options suck for various reasons because every time she had reason in the past to make a change she refused to,human
616,i 25m am confused after coworker 21f showing strong interest for a bit then act indifferentso theres this girl at work 21f which i 25m clicked with right away when we first met were talking here and there but nothing special going on few months go by i suddenly develop strong feelings for this girl it was quite sudden and intense at one point it got so intense i decided to tell her about it  she turned me down no big deal then we keep talking like normal but now we gradually start talking even more and get closer in the process were both rather fun in nature we just have fun in the boring workplace however i am no longer going in with any romantic intentexpectation shes just a cool person at work that i like to talk to and with whom we have many things to talk about and whom i have interest to get to know better as a person then few months later suddenly out of nowhere she began showing a strong interest in me for about 2 weeks perhaps 3 i was riding the wave and enjoying the ride but i also started developing those strong and intense feelings from before again i fell quick and i fell hard but after those 23 weeks she started to not slowly but rather quickly by the day show less and less interest and attraction and now we dont really talk anymore at all but those 2 weeks felt so so real it felt like teenagers being in love in high school it felt so real whole thing threw me quite off guard really but the thing that annoys me the most is i have no idea why that last bit happened and how should i best proceed from the current situation i am aware that this personor soul has some really really special role in my life i just cant quite figure it out and this i am confused about my next moves and general direction even i would much appreciate some guidanceadvicetldr  fell for a girl at work told her about it she turned me down no big deal we kept talking i no longer had romantic expectations or intentions we start talking more and we get closer then she suddenly began showing strong interest for 23 weeks then suddenly began acting completely indifferent  now we dont really talk anymore idk how to interpret the whole thing especially that last bit,human

went to the mcdonalds near my house we were at mcdonalds sitting at one of the booths drinking our iced coffees a little boy named david started playing peekaboo with me behind my boyfriends side of the booth after a while of playing my boyfriend seemed visibly annoyed with the little boy i found the little boy very cute so i asked if he wanted to sit with us for a bit he sat next to us and was such a sweet kid he later returned back to his table behind my boyfriends side of the booth he peeked over again to play peekaboo however this time david looked shocked he said miss miss hes looking at pictures of other girls and i laughed and said what and he said yah hes looking at pictures of other girls that arent you i turned to my boyfriend david came back and sat next to us and i asked him can i see your phone and he said the kid is lying i said okay lol and then david replied miss im not lying he is i said honestly you know that children dont lie can i see your phone and so after a long hesitation he handed me his phone on his snapchat i saw a few women snapping him constantly maybe 100s of snaps in the last 24 hours so i opened one and its pictures of a naked girl i kept opening them and it was more and more explicit pictures of the same girl i opened other snaps he was sent and it was the same thing but different girls when i showed him his phone and said dude wtf who are these girls he replied and laughed and said no dw its just porn probably a bot account i replied saying that you added on snapchat and he said yah they requested me and i followed them back i said but youre saving all the videos she sends you and he said yah so i can watch them later yknow i asked him do you think that i would think thats okay he was silent i had a random gut feeling and asked him to show me his instagram account and he said no i said why he said i deleted it i said redownload it redownload it rn i took his phone and downloaded it and made him sign in after a lot of hesitation he signed in i dont have instagram ive never made one im not sure how to navigate the app i asked him where are the dms and he pointed at the arrow i opened them i was shocked he wasnt just talking to 1 or 2 girls so many girls in the gta he was messaging them first he was asking them to hangout he was meeting them at their house he legit met one girl the same day he saw me and rushed me that he needed to go he met with girls while i was here in the gta and when i attended a destination wedding in thailand he was talking to these girls while we were in a serious committed exclusive relationship i asked him why what did you do with these other girls and when he said nothing i asked him did you meet up with them he said yes i asked him again what did you do with them and he replied nothing he even tried to gaslight me that its not that big of a deal because it happened a couple of months ago i wasnt having any of that and thats when i realized hes not going to tell me the truth so i took his phone and walked outside of mcdonalds and proceeded to walk home which was about a 25 minute walk in 3 degrees celsius without a jacket he followed me he kept saying can we please talk and i kept calling him an a he ran back to his car and then continued to follow me in his car shouting my name and asking can we please talk i called my brother i told him its an emergency and to come pick me up from the street i was walking on he came within a few mins of me calling him my boyfriend saw my brother pull up and so he sped off and ended up going to his evening class at the university of toronto commuted from the mississauga campus to the toronto campus i proceeded to call his older brother hes an imaam or like an islamic priest on my boyfriends phone and tell him everything that happened i was really distressed so i was basically just screaming that hes cheating on me and were supposed to introduce parents soon and continue marriage talks in may his brother apologized on his behalf i ended up hanging up i had plans with my friends to go to the movies after work so outside my house my friend was waiting in the car i left my brothers car and went into her car we drove to the movie theaters winston churchill cineplex to meet up with my other friend and we were returned our movie tickets we ended up going back and forth between oakville and mississauga and i decided im going to go to his house and tell his parents what he did he lives in ancaster which is so far out but my friends were willing to drive me i have never met his parents he is scared of his parents and i knew that he has never told his parents about me he had only recently told his brother that he wanted to marry me and needed his help to tell their parents so i drove with my friends to his house and ended up conversing with his family about what he did they asked me so many questions about myself and what i was doing here and what i want in terms of next steps they wanted to confirm with me that i no longer want to be in a relationship with him they advised me that i shouldnt be with someone that behaves this way we left from their home and drove back to mississauga and i was dropped off at my place when i got home i realized because i had his phone he was emailing me the entire time asking to meet up to talk however in person earlier when i asked him why he did it his only response was i thought we were going to break up in december so i didnt think it mattered anymore when i asked them why the f would you think we were going to break up in december we were so good like he was buying me flowers we were going on dates we were seeing each other frequently and talking all day and its because in december he came clean to me about lying from the start of our relationship he lied that he was going to graduate in december 2022 the reason that lie is significant is because when we were getting into a relationship i didnt want to date someone who wasnt done university and wasnt currently working fyi  i have three university degrees two undergraduate degrees and my masters and i work fulltime however he told me he had a plan and he was on track to graduate by december and he should have a job by then as well however he was failing all his courses and in 2022 only passed 1 course out of all the courses he took so he was well aware he wasnt graduating yet he continued talking about proceeding towards marriage we even went engagement ring shopping and so he thought when he came clean and told me the truth about lying about his grades and graduation i would just break up with him because it would take a long time for him to graduate and he still wouldnt have a job in our initial agreed upon timeline however i forgave him because i saw how genuinely and deeply sorry he was for lying to me about his grades and graduation i guess he didnt anticipate for me to forgive him that still doesnt give him the right to engage in romantic conversations and sexual activity with other women because he is planning to break up with me anyways in december so its okay to cheat from sept  nov like im not in the know i am not aware i had no clue so i dont think its justified but thats how he justified it to himself for me  cheating is unforgivable to him  telling his parents or even going to his house was unforgivable he crossed my boundaries and so i crossed his because clearly he lacks the capacity to empathize with me at this point with all the lying and the cheating what more does he want me to endure like you pushed back all our timelines our future is very uncertain right now its all dependent on whether or not you get your s together and genuinely ive been helping him through everything with assignments work applications being a source of encouragement and literally being his best friend he also had so many opportunities to come clean to me in december i even told him if youve been lying about anything else or if youve been cheating on me cuz usually lying and cheating go hand in hand please tell me now and im willing to forgive everything and we can move forward and he said no i promise thats the only thing that i lied about and i said okay we can continue our relationship i wanted input on the following i dont know if what i did was okay my friends are telling me that 1 he had clear intentions of cheating on me 2 he planned it by messaging other girls and meeting up with them 3 his motive was sexual in natureand all of that is unforgivable and its not a mistake that just happened once my brother still has his phone his parents are coming to pick up his phone today from my house because they want evidence of what type of sexual activities he was engaging in  i dont know whats going to happen to him because i know he comes from a very strict religious family i noticed both his cell phone lines us and can were cut off im going through mental turmoil i literally hate him and i cant forgive him at the same time i never got any closure or any real understanding why this happened i cant sleep i havent eaten anything since monday night im not able to focus at work and my mind is scattered and i feel betrayed and heart broken im losttldr summary heremy boyfriend and i dated for over one year he comes from a strict muslim family he cheated on me a couple days ago i took his phone i ended up going to his house and telling his family i still have his phone his parents are going to come pick up his phone soon i dont know whats going to happen to him and i dont know if what i did is wrong i got absolutely no closure,human

632,my ex broke up with me because he cant handle a serious relationship should i 21f see my ex 20m occassionally or fully move onmy ex 20m broke up with me 21f a month ago we dated for 8 months he broke up with me because he wants to be single and not have to consider another person he admitted how scared he is to fully let go and love another person the lack of control over himself and his emotions the inevitability of being hurt because he thinks that at this age were doomed to break up at one point so why not control when he gets hurt and just break up now i think that he feels a lack of control because before me girls would be obsessed with him and not that im not obsessed but he shows his love more than i do and i think he has the impression that he loves me more than i love him a week before the break up he got really scared and upset because he thought i was gonna break up with him but we wound up having a really good emotional conversation where he told me how deeply he cares about me and he later started feeling really uncomfortable from his public display of vulnerability from all of our conversations i really think he can see mewants a future with me but he doesnt want to stop experiencing life while hes young because hes in a relationship despite this i think he truly does love me but with his lack of emotional intelligence and his ingrained selfishness he would rather have the freedoms offered to him by being single which im sure also includes hooking up with girls than be tied down tbh i think that a lot of boys can cheat on their girlfriends and hook up with girls while they still love someone the selfish ones at least hes not a bad person but he has a lot of growing up to do and because of this i do not wanna get back together right now i think he has to change in a way that only happens with time im honestly happy being single and being able to do what i want without the responsibilities of a relationship i think this is an important period of my life where i might be missing out on fun experiences and doing what i want that im not gonna get the chance to do when im olderthe issue is that despite his flaws he was really my best friend i love him and i know he loves me but i dont think this is the worst situation because ive also had a lot of fears about missing out on my youth because the choices i make affect another person i want to travel kiss who i want to and have wild spontaneous moments that turn into stories not have to sacrifice my youth because of a serious almost codependent relationshipi know that he would be okay with this but i need advice outside from people telling me i deserve better and what he did was fucked up which i do deserve better but he never cheated or lied and hes allowed to not want to be in a relationship even if it hurts me i dont want him to never be in my life again i definitely need more time to solidify the breakup but i would like to see him occasionally maybe once or twice a month or less than that or more in a way that is far from friends but i still get to have him in my life when i decide i would only do this once im really comfortable being single and i am talking tohookinguphanging out around other guys i know this will change and i will probably meet someone else and be happy but i dont see myself in a relationship with someone else i have a few other exs that i deeply loved and did for a long time but i have never felt this way about someone else certain that this is the kind of man i want to marry and be with in the future so should i see my ex occasionally or move on and go no contacttldr my boyfriend broke up with me a month ago because he cant handle being in a serious relationship he wants freedom without the responsibility of a relationship and he is afraid of being emotional and being hurt being single is probably what i need at this point in my life but we love each other and i would like to keep him in my life should i see him occasionally when i decide or take a clean break,human

635,me 26m with my girlfriend 22f shared some of my traumas from the pasthey i dont really know why i have the need to do this but my brain is playing with me so here it is i am in a quite short relationship at the moment both me and my new girlfriend are quite into each other and we have been together for 2 weeks now we talked about our pasts and our experiences that we do not want to happen in our relationship everything is just going really good and i like her quite a lot i did learn quite a lot about her that i like and she learned quite a lot about me that she likes i have had really bad relationships in the past and those have played a big role for me to not hop into a new relationship pretty fast so i was single for almost 3 years now yesterday i had a really bad day for some reason and today when we saw each other i decided to go a bit deep into my traumas one of those is trust issues and i wanted to let her know that i do have problem with that but for the duration of our relationship i never had any of those thoughts i do have a lot of trust in her and i dont really know why i had the need to do that but i did it her reaction was at first worrying but i reassured her that with her i dont really feel the same way and it is all good i really dont know why i said it but there we go it is too late now to go back and change it i did it because i trust her and i feel safe with her at the same time i am working on fixing everything with my mental health and i go to therapy as well second thing i hate it when i need to wait for a response for 45 hours on the texts i understand it when i know that for example she studies and i know that she studies or has uni or work or anything that is really not the problem i started laughing when i was telling that because i sounded controlling and she started laughing with me and told me i know what you mean dont worry i felt dumb and annoyed with myself for telling that the way i told her but here we go she reassured me she understands it and i have nothing to worry about i hate it when i dont get the answer when i know she doesnt have anything and basically sits home and plays with her dog for example then i asked her would you be okay if i answered you 4 hours later and you know i had nothing beside me sitting by the pc playing games and she said of course i wouldnt be okay i felt good when i told her all of this but at the same time overthinking kicks me in the butt nowtldr so basically i told my gf that i have trust issues but none with her and that with her i feel safe around and i trust her so thats why i told her that i hate late answers 45 hours late answers not 3 hours or less when i know that both of us are free she reassured me that everything is fine and that she is happy that i shared all of that with her and made some jokes later during texts about all that am i overthinking for no reason,human

645,my 40m wife 39f wife tells me shes grossed out by my lack of expertise in one area of sex and she says that she will never let that change i dont know how to feel about itok not sure where to begin on this one since it involves a lot of relationship backstory but ill do my best i 40m have been married to my wife 39f for 10 years and together for 4 years before that we have in almost all ways a good marriagean beautiful home happy and healthy kids fulfilling careers independent hobbies as well as shared interests good conversations a good set of friends whom we entertain at our house and in general love and trust as the youngest kid is getting better our sex life is also improving to look a bit more like it was prekids though of course we are more tired busier and less carefree and that just comes with the territory of being a parentive always had some insecurity around sex i was an overweight and shy teenager didnt lose my virginity until i was 20 and only had a couple of mediumtolonger term relationships before w and i got together at a point when i was just beginning to feel confident around women she came into the marriage much more experienced i recognize that caring about body counts is pretty silly and sexist and ive worked to get over insecurity about that in particular one way weve done is by talking through some prior experiences and trying to make that exciting but theres a lingering issue that is causing me to experience what feels like an intimacy gap and it just seems unsolvable early in our relationship i went down on her a few times but she wasnt enthusiastic about it and didnt want it to be part of our routine at the time she explained it as just being something she didnt enjoy when i later learned that shed had relationships with women i was a little more skeptical but she then stuck to her original answer more recently she admitted that that wasnt true and that receiving oral sex had been a significant part of her past relationships but that she just didnt want to do it now i felt hurt by this particularly the lack of honesty she later tried to explain it as just something that she didnt want sexually from men but even more recently owned up to the real explanation which is just that she didnt think i was good at it early on doesnt like the idea of teaching me and now has feelings of revulsion associated with me and that act in particular that she isnt interested in getting over most recently she told me that it would never happen with me but that if i pressed it she would let me do it and lie and say it felt good the possibility that its something she could help teach me how to do in a pleasurable way is categorically off the table this has triggered some pretty deep seated feelings of insecurity in me i recognize that those are my responsibility and not her fault and tbth i dont care that much about this particular sex act nonetheless im having a ton of trouble getting past the fact that my wife finds my lack of experience in our area actually repulsive and she wouldnt entertain the possibility of trying to making me better and thus more able to feel like i can make her happy the only solution shes offered so far is that i could go sleep with other woman and get more experienced before shed be willing to try she has pretty flexible feelings about monogamy though we havent opened up our marriage but im not particularly enthusiastic about that option for various reasonsthe upshot is that i feel a gulf of intimacy between us its such a small thing yet its really hard to get past the idea that my wife just finds me sexually gross due to my lack of experience in this way and is totally unwilling to and interested in making it better and that ill be lied to if i press it again it just makes me feel less close to her and that i have no prospect of ever having the kind of closeness i want again this is not really about this specific thingits about what it conveys about how she feels about me so with the caveat that i know my insecurities about my own background are my own problem is it still fair for me to be hurt by her and what if anything should i do about it either way tldr wife admits after years of marriage that she doesnt let me perform oral sex because shes too grossed out by my early efforts and she would never consider working with me to make it better i feel hurt and insecure and dont know how to handle those feelings,human
646,draining friendampx200bthis will be a rather long post but i hope some people will take their time to read it cause boy do i need adviceim f21 and used to have a big friend group going out for coffee or a beer for that sake during weekdays  and would be out every weekend because of some dumb reason they all turned their back against me this was a bit over a year ago today i know they regret how they handled the situation but i never got back in contact with themlong story short i met this girl half a year ago f25 and she introduced me to a lot of people and i was back to the person i used to be going out every weekend and meeting new people but our friendship quickly started to drain me and a lot of people told me to cut her off and still do lets call her sarah sarah and i quickly became each others best friend but with that a big responsibility came i had to constantly reassure her that she was pretty enough good enough had a great personality and bla bla bla you get the point this would occur everytime we went out and the whole vibe would be based on how insecure she felt that day which most of the time were awful she was the leader of the group and things had to go her way so you can imagine how it is with a bad vibe she would often lie to get things her way or be jealousinsecure when we went out since she always compared herself to me or sometimes others this would make me feel bad and i reassured her that people dont want me  but her her responds would always be you have to say that since youre my friend but would still ask me to reassure herfor a while i stopped because i knew i would just get snarky responds but that would offend herone night i just got enough of her bullshit i had told her i wanted to go to an event for the longest time note i actually already had planned to go with a friend she wanted to be invited so i did and she reassured me that yeah ofc we would go but ofc she had to show off her new job and when i asked when we would leave she said yeah maybe later this girl wanted to go somewhere else because a boy she liked was there i got told by one of our mutual friends who was with us that night that sarah asked her to tell me she didnt have money enough so that would be an excuse to not go literally to the girl i had plans with first which hurt me and pissed me off at the same time so i left and she got annoyed and started texting me my response was that i got told these things and she said it was a lie  i offered her multiple times to meet me outside so we could talk but that just got brushed over at one point i texted i cant be friends with people who lies all the time this was not only her but the whole group i was talking about and she knew that  she decided to block me on all social medias and refused to give me my stuff back this was after weve been friends for about 4 months i was very depressed at that time not only had i lost her but the whole friend group i was back to square one and questioned myself am i the reason why im losing friends all the time i tried to keep my chin up but my heart was hurtig lol 23 months later she hit me up on facebook she apparently left the group since it was so toxic and met a guy while traveling her reason for contacting me was she missed me and our friendshipwe became friends again but this time it was just the two of us  and long distance ill try to make this short but everything again has to go her way we wanted to move and start traveling together ofc to the country where the guy she met lives because she felt at home me being me i followed her and we traveled to london  we decided that we would go again though i needed some time since i had an exam and couldnt book anything before she only had to wait one freaking day but she decided that right here right now she would book everything and i told her multiple times that i couldnt just throw everything out of my hands and just leave and that ill book tomorrow she got mad for me not understanding and said my reaction isnt fair because she has a lot going on and she would just go with a friend she said everything is not about you i have other people in my life this was about a week ago and these words still kinda hurt note it was our dream to get a job together in london we havent texted that much since shes in london right now but when we do its about her all the time i told her today i got offered a job interview her response was yay and quickly changed the topic back to her and how shes going out bowling with other people tonight im thinking like okay  what do you want me to say its like this all the time and at this point i dont know if im jealous or just annoyed theres so much more but ill make a list cause this is too long everything has to go her way very bipolar and has psychotic issues tho this shouldnt stop someone from being friends the bipolar is just a lot knows how to make you feel bad and will do it on purpose once said her friend thought i was hot and that she liked him but in a friendly way few days later she took him home and had sex i wonder why  gets jealous if someone likes me recently got mad because i talked to this guy at the club who she liked she literally has a man tho not official and we went downstairs to get beer note how she never told me she liked him since we literally met him that night and he doesnt even like girls her problems takes up a lot of time and i feel like im only here for her to vent proceeds to go back to the guy she vents about and i just feel like my time is wasted ngl we sometimes chat for 3 hours about this whole problem gets mad when i dont respond when online and spam gets mad if i skip over her question or dont hype her up will actually stalk u and see if youre online if you dont respondnow you may ask why dont you just cut her off and the thing is i love her and i now she loves me for the first time i feel like i found a best friend where im also theirs most of the time she

648,should i 26 m stay with my gf 26f of 5 years i have been with my girlfriend for over 5 years now and she has been asking for me to pop the question a lot especially lately we dont have a lot of problems we have been to couples counseling before for arguing but almost everyone we know refers to us as a dream couple we have the same hobbies we do pretty much everything together we live together we have the same sense of humor etcso whats the problempart of it is and there is no way to say this without seeming like a bad person and being vain but i am just finding myself less and less attracted to her she is not bad looking by any means but physical attraction was never what made us get together and she was never my type i was just amazed by how chill and fun she was and how well we normally get along the other part is things shes does have been annoying me more often than they used to and becoming harder to overlook she is a very headstrong and type a personality so i pretty much always have to let her lead otherwise conflict arises this has lead to a dent in my confidence as i feel less manly and in control sometimes even though i know that is ridiculous and somewhat misogynistic it just kind of feels like what she says goes and if i argue i will always lose so i just dont speak up sometimes which leads to internalized problems like thesewe still have sex slightly less than weekly and its normally pretty good but she doesnt get me going as much as other girls have in the past and the excitement i feel seeing other girls never went away i was with dozens of girls before and it was when i was at my most confident obviously that lifestyle shouldnt be permanent but i feel if i had to date again now would be the time as im more than halfway through my twenties and if i wait too long it seems to only get worselogically it makes almost complete sense to marry her we have built a pretty good life together we live together we have a cat we both adore we have both become fully immersed into each others families i already know what ring she wants we do everything together etcbut would i be making the worst or best decision of my life if i didnt marry her which would i guess mean leaving her i can not imagine leaving her and this life we have but i cant imagine marrying someone unless i have complete confidence in the decision and i just dont right now she has been waiting for years so the pressure is only getting worse and i dont know how much longer she can waiti have been feeling this awful indecisiveness for over a year and it is eating me alive i truly do not know what the right decision is i have even considered things like polyamory but i doubt she would ever go for that do i suck it up and marry someone that mostly makes sense and would put so much less strain on my life or do i risk it all for the excitement of dating again and the possibility id be happierampx200btldr  my gf wants me to propose asap and i am more scared than excited on if i am making the right decision,human
649,does he even like meso i 35f am engaged to my 35m boyfriend of 12 years we have not been doing well romantically and intimately and are in therapy together to try to sort things out i feel like hes holding on to our relationship with a death grip because we are pretty codependent and now have a young child but it has been feeling increasingly like he doesnt actually like me as a person i have always felt like i am just a terrible and annoying person because of an abusive upbringing so any time i felt this from him i felt like i understood why he wouldnt like me or would think im annoying or too much to deal with now that im healing my trauma it seems more and more like i chose a partner who is in a lot of ways similar to my caregivers as a child who really messed me up he is not abusive but i feel emotionally neglected all the time manipulated and that his love for me is at times conditional i have tried everything i can possibly think of to get him to stop taking me for granted to show him there are issues that need his immediate attention and that my love for him is slowly dying it took him over a year of constant fighting and me pleading to agree to couples therapy and he says he thinks its helpful and valuable but i feel like theres been hardly any significant changes and several of the changes i have seen have not been consistent in a lot of our sessions i feel like he just wastes the whole hour creating untrue narratives about his part in the issues and then we end up going back and forth about this made up narrative and are not really getting anywhere i feel so exhausted every time i try to tell him im at the end of my patience with xyz happening he then seems to somehow make it all about me and how im not sure i want to be in the relationship anymore and thats why theres a problem every time i tell him when he hurts me emotionally he makes me explain it in excruciating detail and it feels like i have to argue why what happened hurt me i feel neglected and alone so often it contributes heavily to my depression and self esteem issues that i have been working really hard on improving any time i call him out for  what feels to me like gas lighting manipulation or lying  he just tells me it was not his intention and so its not actually gas lighting or lying manipulation i told him recently that looking back it hurts me that he has seemingly never supported any of my ambitions and in some cases did the opposite of encouraging me i just keep looking back at past and more present instances where the way he has treated me if he were anyone else i would assume they do not like me fundamentally i think the most depressing part lately is that he waited for 12 years to propose to me and we have been engaged for almost a year neither of us want a big or expensive wedding but he wont set a date i have told him numerous times for almost our whole engagement i wanted to get married at the end of this year on a specific significant date and he doesnt seem to care and has given no indication he has thought about it in any significant wayi promised i would stick with therapy and not just walk away without warning but i honestly dont know what to do anymore i feel myself slipping back into a deep depression where i just cry all the time and cant seem to enjoy anything except sleeping i have talked to him directly in therapy and outside of it about pretty much all of this and nothing seems to changetldr my fianc doesnt seem to like me as a person but likes our relationship and life together i am feeling depressed about the thought he doesnt like me as a person therapy and direct talks do not seem to make any difference am i misreading the situation maybe because of my mental health am i wasting my time waiting for things to get better or am i rally just an insufferable person who should be thankful to have a relationship at all am i looking at this all the wrong way,human
