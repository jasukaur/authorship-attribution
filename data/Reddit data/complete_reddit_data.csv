"I know something I'm not supposed to, and it's breaking my heart.","I (20 female) have been best friends with L (23 female) since I was a freshman in high school, she was a senior. She moved in with me and my family about halfway through her senior year, as we had become inseparable, and her home life wasn't the best, and we have been sisters ever since. about a year and a half ago she got married, I was her maid of honor. Durning this time I was introduced to a friend of hers we'll call R (23 female), the three of us became the friendship trio I have always dreamed of. Unfortunately, about 7 months into L's marriage it fell apart and they split. she has been seeing someone new for a while now. she started seeing him very shortly after they split. me and R expressed some concern but told her as long as she was happy, we were too. fast froward to now. yesterday I got a call from R where she tells me that L is 2 months pregnant and won't tell me.   she told R and not me.. this hurt me a bit. Me and L have been through hell and back together and she doesn't want to tell me this. R thinks it's because she's worried about how I will respond. It breaks my heart that after all these years she doesn't trust me to love and support her on this. I called L saying I just wanted to check in. I didn't want to expose R for telling me this. We spoke for over 2 hours, and she said nothing about the baby. I don't know what to do, I feel betrayed and hurt, but I'm also worried about her doing this without a big support system. Is it possible to me excited for, completely heartbroken by, and blood boiling mad at someone all at the same time? I am a bit mad at R as well for telling me this, breaking L's trust and bringing the weight on me. Should she have just left well enough alone and waited until she decided to tell me? I'm so conflicted. If I wait till L tells me, I will always have this anger in my heart and I don't want that. But if I confront her, I am also betraying R's trust. I am excited to be an aunt and I just want this conflict delt with so I can focus on giving my best friend the support she needs during her pregnancy. But this has broken my heart. any advice would be helpful, I'm completely stuck.",,,,,,,,
Should I admit the truth in my interview?,"I recently applied for a job requiring Spanish and English proficiency. Today I got an email for an interview; they said in the interview they’ll test my proficiency. I decided to take an online assessment just to make sure I’m still proficient, and it seems not. Bc I’m not a native speaker, I don’t speak Spanish often &amp; it seems like I forgot many words/verbiage. Should I still interview for this job? Should I admit to them that my proficiency isn’t as great as I thought? I meet all the other requirements for the job.",,,,,,,,

My girlfriend was in an attempted rape,"Hello, I [22m] am in a relationship with my girlfriend[20f] and I'm currently having a hard time figuring out what I can do. My girlfriend is from a small town so it's one of those situations where everyone is friends with everybody, and so she has a friend group of about 10 - 15 people. There was this one guy, let's call him Mark(fake name). Mark was a part of this friend group for a long long time until recently because of all sorts of stupid things he has done to multiple people from the friend group, like living 3 months with a girl and not pay her rent and spent it on drugs etc... Recently my girlfriend opened up about Mark shoving his dick inside of her mouth forcefully once, and she told me that noone knows about this but me. I took it with a grain of salt at first because it is a big accusation but throughout listening stories about Mark from the rest of her friend group I can almost be assured that the rape attempt was true. I have become good friends with her friens group so I usually get called to birthdays and such from her friends. The problem begins here because one of the ""core"" friends from that group is good friends with Mark still. And obviously she doesn't know what he did so I can't be mad at her. Before I continue I just want to point out that I've never been the violent type , literally never been in a fight my whole life, and I always avoid them because it is stupid. But the urge I get of beating the shit out of him is something I literally never felt before... I obviously communicated this feeling with my girlfriend and she's aware of it too. Because of this I didn't go to the birthday of my girlfriends friend and I feel bad because of this. What should I do in this position?",,,,,,,,
Friendship advice needed - Best friend is online most of the time yet takes days to respond to my messages. i'm starting to doubt whether she really means it when she says i'm her closest friend and misses me...,"We haven't seen each other in 2 years as we are at different universities. She posts on her snapchat story regularly as well as posts on instagram almost every day but says that she is bad at responding to messages now as she gets so many (she's become quite popular at her uni).

But what i don't understand is she literally told me that she doesn't like 90% of the people she's friends with and pretends to be friends with them to avoid drama in order. And the very few she genuinely does like and isn't just faking a friendship with, apparently she's still closer to me than those friends.

Yet she seems to be more active in texting them and replying to them within hours via posts and direct messages everyday (she posts some of these conversations on her snap story so i see them) than she is with my text conversations with her.

i just don't understand how she can text me stuff like ""i hugged my friend today who i haven't seen in a long time and it reminded me of the way you hug cos you give the best hugs and it made me really upset and miss you lots"" because surely if she did miss me as much as she says she does, then she would prioritise our text conversations compared to those with people she sees in person everyday so i'm really not sure why she says stuff like that when there's no evidence to prove she means it.

I'm pretty sure that if you were closer to someone and they were your best friend who you haven't seen in 2 years, you would make an effort to text them more regularly than friends you see in person and talk to every day.

So am i right in doubting that she might not mean what she says to me and she probably doesn't consider me a best friend anymore and does actually like her uni friends more than me but obviously doesn't want me to know? is she just using me as a backup friend or something in case her new friendships don't last forever?",,,,,,,,
i was playing football with my sibs in the living room and i fucked up,"as the title suggests, i kicked the ball way too hard and hit the tv. broke the screen. My parents are gonna kill me. I will tell them that i’m responsible for it but are there any more way i can do to help them with it? i decided to use all the money i have to pay for the fixing cost and apply a part time job for it. There’s too much going on in my head and i dont know where to start. My hands are shaking. It’s 3 am now my parents are asleep as i’m typing this.",,,,,,,,
Update on my parents stealing my meds,"Thank you all for the advice. 

My dad apologized for freaking out. He explained that this mail thing is happening because it's a habit. They've always just blindly opened the mail at the end of the day because any and all mail used to only be theirs. They apparently still see me as a kid who doesn't get mail often. 

He then proceeded to claim that he is still unsure if I should get my meds back because of the way I originally acted. Apparently he can't see that someone would push the issue after months and months of them politely asking not to invade their privacy. 

I told him to look at it from literally anyone else's point of view. If someone else was opening their mail, you ask them to respect their privacy, and they continue to open their mail anyways. Seems to me that anyone would push the issue more at that point. But no. Apparently getting angry after a literal year of them not respecting my privacy is absolutely insane and I need to quit these meds that are supposedly making me go crazy. I feel that I was actually too lenient. I should've pushed back sooner. 

Well he had no valid rebuttal after I said that. Yet he is still debating giving my meds back. I have yet to talk to my mom. She is playing the silent game. She will be the hardest to convince. Even if I have every valid argument laid out on a silver platter, she will still come up with some bullshit excuse and turn it around on me. 

We will see what happens tonight. If she refuses to give my meds, I am debating just straight up calling the police. This is absolutely ridiculous and childish. I am the crazy drug addict for simply asking them to respect my privacy? Fuck that. I am an adult. I have rights. If they continue to open my mail and take my medication, a literal controlled substance, idk how the fuck they don't get it.",,,,,,,,
"My Brother(M19) is in Trouble, and I(M20) Don't Know What To Do","I just recently talked about this horrible situation with my brother, K. He is currently in probation for having some speeding tickets, and is getting close to finishing it. However, about maybe 2 weeks before, he was contacted by a person ( unknown gender or age ) who threatens him with doxing and accusing him of rape and harassment if K doesn't give them money. He was currently given this little fucker about close to $1,000 dollars, and they want an additional $1,000. K first contacted his probation officer, and all they said was, "" That's tough"". Glad to know where my tax dollars are going towards. He then went to an agency, who will be investigating to see if this individual can be caught and if they live in the US, can be charged with stealing from my little brother. 

I just...feel so fucking hopeless. I rarely use social media, but the person claims to have phone numbers of our parents, friends, and even distant relatives. They know where he works, where we live, and even some of our names. k feels so depressed, and tired. He told me that he could of been done with paying off his probation, but now he is stuck in a loop with this piece of shit human being.

I hoping that going into this subreddit, I can find resources to help my brother out, and finally break him free that that motherfucker. I know a subreddit called r/legaladvice, and do plan to go there for more advice. Thank you for reading, and please help my brother.",,,,,,,,
should i shave my head?,"i’m a 20 year old female and i have a whole chunk of broken hair. the right side of my head is just broken, choppy looking hair. it looks like i have a mullet but on only one side. i put my hair up so it’s not as noticeable but i’ve been told i need to keep it down for it to heal. i’ve bought new shampoo and conditioner and other things to fix it, but i don’t have very much money and im scared it’s just not gonna work. of course, this is reddit and im not going to do what the first person tells me to, but i would like a little advice. is it crazy of me to consider just shaving it? or do you think i should just wait it out and see if it starts growing? the thing is, i didn’t notice it was as bad as it was until it was too late. i wanna get ahead of it this time so i can stop looking like a dumb, half mullet head lady.",,,,,,,,
I have two great prospective careers and idk what to do,"I got a job offer from the Canadian Armed Forces, and it's been something I've been working so long for. However, I recently started in a nifty warehouse job and I have great prospects working here. The only thing is my current position is a temp position until September, so I am not guaranteed a job once I am done.

Both offer equally great benefits, and I can make a living out of both. I simply just don't know what to do, how to feel about it, or what to pick.",,,,,,,,
"Feeling resentment towards a friend, but still want to help them. Help!","I have a friend, let’s call them Frank. I’ve known Frank for years and our friendship has gone through its natural rhythm like most friendships go. We’ve been really close for a few years then taper off then find each other again. 

Frank and I are part of a group chat with some other friends and for the past 6 months or so this is how we’ve stayed in contact. No one on one interaction. For the past few months Frank has been responding to some of the memes that I send to the group chat with some snarky comments about me and playing them off as a joke. We usually joke around by teasing each other, but some of these snarky comments have been oddly specific. A few months ago Frank needed some help with their resume and help with buying some concert tickets. I gladly helped out as no one else in the group chat seemed to want to help him (not to throw it in Frank’s face, but I’ve constantly helped him numerous times and have done countless favors and have never asked for anything in return). Frank is currently struggling to find a job as he studied in a very specific field (this will come into play later). Frank reluctantly took my help and was a little unappreciative, but whatever maybe he was having a bad day. 

Fast forward a few months and it’s my birthday. All my friends are wishing me a happy birthday, but I never get a message from Frank. I ended hanging out with some other friends who are in the group chat and I just told them that I was sad that Frank didn’t wish me a happy birthday and I felt weird because of all of Frank’s snarky comments the last few months. One of those friends, Ben, ended up telling me that Frank was angry at me. Ben told me that Frank is upset because I’ve had some big changes in my life. I got a huge promotion at my job, bought a new car, and I just got back from a trip to Japan. Frank had felt like every time I talked about my wins I was showing off and somehow rubbing everything in his face. That was not my intention at all. I felt pretty hurt hearing what Ben said. About 3 days later, Frank texted me happy birthday in a very monotone way. I’m pretty sure the only reason Frank texted me was because Ben told them to because I was sad. 

With a few months of hindsight, I’m a little more upset than sad at this point. First, because Frank got upset with me and didn’t tell me anything. Second, because even though they were upset they still asked and accepted favors from me. Third, I guess I’m kind of upset that they’re upset to begin with. I thought friends were supposed to be happy for each other. Not get mad when the other has wins in life.

Anyway, here is the ending. Through mutual friends I met someone named Jordan who is in the exact field that Frank is looking for a job in. I’ve become really close friends with Jordan and I feel confident that if I asked this Jordan to help out Frank they definitely would. I’ve even asked about open positions and the hiring process and Jordan told me that if I knew anyone with qualifications that he could get them a job at his company. I want to introduce Jordan and Frank, but I’m still feeling hurt and resentful from the whole saga described above and I wonder if it’s even worth it. I don’t know if it would be extremely petty of me to talk to Frank and try to get him to muster out some sort of apology before helping him or if I shouldn’t even help him at all. If I am out of touch please call me out, I want to know if I’m being ridiculous. 

TLDR; Friend is angry at me for life wins. I now have the potential to help them out with a job search in a huge way, but I feel like I need an apology first. Am I being petty?",,,,,,,,

Did I ruin my chance at growing as an adult by buying my mom and I a house?,"My mom (59) and I (29f) have a very close relationship, she has always supported my career which I have been hyper focused on all throughout my 20s. I have 0 friends that aren't just online friends. We have always lived together with my Dad (always with my help financially) but he has gotten very into conspiracy and just went off the deep end mentally which ended up with us being on eggshells. I decided to build a house out of state so that my mom could retire at the beach. We have been living here for 6 months and nearly every day at the back of my mind I wonder if I made a mistake. I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders now, and haven't truly felt at home and I'm wondering if it's because I gave up too much of myself to get here.   


I haven't really had a real relationship, am very overweight (hi stress eating), and have horrible anxiety &amp; financial stress. I was hoping that moving would be my new chapter, but it's only made things for me mentally so much worse. I don't even know where to start to dig myself out of this hole I put myself in. I want a relationship and a future to look forward to, but after so many years of living in my comfort zone and depending on my parents I don't know how to get out of it.",,,,,,,,
Should I Tell Him? Part 2,"So, I posted on here a little while ago saying how the guy I like is moving away and I asked if I should tell him how I feel. Well, long story short, he isn't moving but staying here and I'm totally psyched about it since I thought it would give me more opportunities to tell him how I feel. We've talked here and there, but the words ""I like you"" have not reached the surface. I was going to tell him today but I lost my confidence as he was talking to two other girls when I was also there. I know it sounds very silly but I just couldn't do it. I wanted to post here to get some advice on how I can approach him next. Do I tell him I like him? Should I ask him on a small date? I'm not sure what to do and any advice would be really helpful.

What should I do I don’t want to be a bad boyfriend,So a couple of weeks ago I got with this very sweet guy and I really do like him. It's not like I'm not telling anyone that were dating in fact I'm pretty open about it. I should also mention that I am a dude (doesn't really matter but I feel like I should add it). Anyway I have this friend that I met at a camp who lives in a whole other town and he's one of my best friends. This friend's mom is friends with my mom and apparently his mom is going on a trip and he needed a place to stay. Normally I would be fine with him coming over but I've got a birthday party Saturday and my bf is going to be there and since I can't just leave my other friend at home I'm gonna have to take him. The problem is that I'm on the aroace spectrum and constantly make jokes about it. I don't really feel like explaining to him how I suddenly got a boyfriend after making aro ace jokes for like 1/2 of a year. I had to tell my friends and boyfriend that I wasn't ready to tell my friend and too not make jokes or poke fun at me and my boyfriend for dating. I could tell my boyfriend seemed a little hurt and now I feel really bad + I don't want to lie to my friend. what the heck do I do in this situation ?,,,,,,,,
Did I make a mistake?,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. 
My dad left our house (My mom, sister and i) when I was 7 years old, and my mom had suffered ever since trying to raise us on her own. 

Fast forward to when I was around 16, my sister re contacted my dad, whom had traveled to the states, and long story short we ended up visiting him that same summer and the one after that. 

In between those two summers, my older sister had graduated high-school and chose to go to a university which was too expensive for my mom to afford. My dad, who was now talking to my mom again told her to send my sister to that university and that he would pay the tuition fees. 

And what do you know, my sister attended the university and my dad never paid, and left it up to my mom to pay for the tuition. 

So the second summer we went to visit him, he got diagnosed with cancer and was dying. When I came back from the states after his diagnoses, my mom was under so much stress as to how she would manage to get out of the debt she was in. She was afraid she'd go to jail. She had been alone all these years trying to just manage and raise us while working in jobs that didn't pay enough. ( my dad didn't let her get her degree back when they were together) 

And so, I sent him a message saying those things ( to please pay my mom the money for tuition because she's scared to go to jail)

Afterwards, I got no message back, and the whole family on my dad's side blocked us from everywhere. My cousins to this day don't talk to us.

There's a lot more that had happened from when he left to that time, and it's all a culmination of my dad and his family hurting my mom. 


But the question is was I wrong to send that message when he was dying? He died that same year a few months later and no one from the family notified us. It was his boyfriends nephew that did.",,,,,,,,
I (22f) caught the guy I’m talking to (22M) hooking up with his ex on spring break,"Long story short, I’ve been talking to this guy since September. About 5-6 months before I met him, he was talking to another girl. They ended things because she wanted to date and he told her no because he didn’t think they were compatible. They were still hooking up but she eventually got with another guy and he cut her off when he found out. He met me and things were good vibes. We hang out, we text, I know his friends he knows mine, we go to each others date parties, etc. Anyways, spring break started Friday. His old girl and her friends are in his same friend group so they were all also on his spring break trip. While on my own separate trip, I saw one of the girls post a photo of my boy and his ex hanging out. She posted multiple photos of them together but I thought nothing of it. UNTIL a photo was posted of his ex girl sitting ON HIS LAP. i screenshotted it and sent a text with the photo to him saying “bet.” Today my friends flew home from our spring break and ran into him and his friends at the airport. They were on our same flight home. He never texted me back, couldn’t even make eye contact with me at the airport, and avoided my friends. He also put a hat on and wore sunglasses inside which was cringey and embarrassing. This was completely different than how he acted on the way to spring break because on the way there, he talked to and hung out with my friends and I at the airport. Ultimately, I am done with him, just hope he knows messed up. Wondering what y’all think he’s thinking? Clearly he knows he messed up by the way he avoided everyone when we were on the flight home. He also knows I’m a no nonsense person and that he’s messed up everything between us with his spring break actions. What do you think is going on in his mind?",,,,,,,,
How do I ask my Dad for help with my depression.,"I've been struggling with depression for the past few years but I didn't know what depression was. I have always held my Dads opinion of me as my highest priority in life and I don't want him to see me as a weaker man because of it. I went to the doctor yesterday because I've had a lack of appetite, been sleeping for +15 hours at a time, and I explained my lack of motivation for hobbies and life in general. 

My doctor told me it was possibly something with my liver and if not it could be severe depression. I just got a call from the doctor and all my blood work just came back and everything looks normal. 

I've gone to my mother multiple times over the past year trying to get her help but she brushes it off and has weaponized it against me like she did my sister. I want help but I don't know how to ask for it from my Dad or if he would react the same way?",,,,,,,,
I(18M) don't know how I feel about this girl(16F),"

So I met this girl at the beginning of the year and she is honestly one of the most amazing girls I have ever met, when I told my friends about her they noticed how happy I was and mentioned it but now I don't know how to feel. I don't know how I feel about her, she has shared some deep emotional stuff with me that I would rather not mention and I was there to support her, though I don't think my personality is right for sharing emotions. I think it has pushed me away. I want to love her and know it I really do because she is amazing and there is truly no one like her but I just can't tell if I do. She doesn't want me to ever leave her and has told me to promise her I won't, I don't know how I feel about this, I think she would make an amazing girlfriend but I don't think she is ready for a relationship. I am so confused about this and I have no clue what to do.",,,,,,,,
How to feel better in a new environment?,"I feel very scrambled atm so I apologize if this text is somewhat incoherent. 

I feel extremely guilty. Recently I moved in with my dad cause I couldn't take the emotional abuse from my mom. But I've been missing home so badly. So I went back. I've been here now for a couple of weeks and my dad keeps asking when I'll come back. I just told him I need time to settle down since I've been trying new meds. 

I feel awful because ever since I started to live with my dad, he keeps saying how it's like sunlight finally came in. He keeps saying how this is a gift from God. I feel terrible because I'm starting to feel like I want to stay with my mom again. I just ignore my mom and go about my day but this life here isn't healthy. Back at my dad's place, I was a better person. I would wall around and get out of bed early. I would clean and take care of myself. But now I spend all day in bed at my moms place since I don't have a room, I sleep on the couch willingly. I don't have privacy here. I want to go back but I keep telling myself ""later"". My dad's a great guy but he doesn't really understand me that much. He's trying to but I keep pushing him away. 
I guess my big issue is that I can't see myself living with my dad. I've been with my mom my whole life and things just seem so different at my dad's. I have control at my dad's and it's not a scramble to do things there. I just don't want him to see me like this. A tired and depressed person sleeping all day and doing nothing. My days consist of waking up and watching things on my phone, eating and then going to bed. Sometimes I'll talk to my sister. This way of living seems unhealthy but it's so addicting. I'm terrified of when or if I'll go back to high school. I just need advice on how to move past this. How do I convince myself to go back to my dad's? Should I? 

I'm scared that things will get worse. Things aren't terrible here as I get to eat whenever but I just don't do anything. At my dad's I rarely ate. I starved myself simply because I just didn't want to eat. Now I binge. I'm overweight and I'm struggling with my new medication. I feel so hopeless but I'm trying to push past this. I keep telling myself things will get better. I just want things to be better. Does anyone have any advice? How do I get over this unhealthy addiction to my moms house? I only come over here to eat and talk to my sister. I can't live without her. But even then this isn't healthy. Things aren't getting better.",,,,,,,,

Finding most life advice and/or aphorisms trite. Struggling with self improvement and life stress?,"Not sure how the phrase the question and I'm struggling.

On one hand I know full well that if I sit here and argue against everything, I'll never figure it out... but in the same breath I've been dealt some really difficult blows as of late... and I can't find myself motivated to live any more.   Like I'm struggling here and all the advice/words/ kindness just feels empty.  

I personally don't like when people cry for help but then fight the help they get... which makes it difficult for me to even ask for help.  Every time I read the standard lines about how it ""gets better"" I just wanna puke or rage out.   Knowing if I was talking to some one, I'd just be frustrating and depressing them. 

The evidence of my life in front of me, the feelings I feel... they're tangible and undeniable. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""hopeful aphorisms""  are ephemeral and seem fake.  I don't believe them to be there.    

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to feel hopeless but I do and I feel like when I try to talk to people about it, I'm wasting their time.  The moment a little phrase comes out or ""It gets better"" or ""When a door shuts, a window opens!"" I just tune out immediately and then just try to close down the conversation.

a couple of days ago i was fine, i enjoyed everything and i was happy. but today, things have changed

i have lost my narcissistic traits, i have lost my happiness, i have no interest in my friends, i don’t want to do anything other than listen to music, and i don’t even think i’m attracted to women anymore.

I crave power lately,"I can try to explain it but I’m a 31 yr old man. I crave power, respect, success, and money comes with that. I even went celibate to just focus on this. I don’t want a relationship. I feel… darker lately. Full time student for computer science. Full time job and I have a child and I’m a single father. Lately I don’t want to be bothered. I don’t want to be bothered with love or anything. All and all I crave freedom. Making sure my little girl is ok. Everyone around me is focused on love or marriage stuck at a dead end job or having children they can’t afford, or they get married and still are unhappy eventually. I look at it as foolish. Am I evil for this?   Am I just too focused? I want love. I want a family eventually.. I just don’t care for it right now.",,,,,,,,
Mods from depression post retaliating?,"I made a post on the r/ depression a while ago and looked through the rules 3 times before finalizing my post to make sure it met the mod’s standards. Soon it got to 16 comments and almost 100 likes and I was able to gain a lot of insight from so many amazing people. However, there were 3 comments that I got email notifications on but they were deleted off of my post so I could unfortunately only read through the first half of them. I sent a message to the moderators to find out why they had been deleted, and shortly after I found that I can no longer access ANY of the comments on from the original post, and the post itself has been disabled/deleted. Why would they do this to someone struggling? I gained so much reassurance from the comments that I was able to read in time and was just starting to feel alright again. Now the mods have completely taken it away. I’ve messaged them again about this, and still complete silence on their end. Can anyone else access those comments from your end from my profile? Please help me learn what went wrong if you can…",,,,,,,,
Feeing undervalued at work. Don’t know how to get what I want.,"Looking for advice. 

I’ve been working at my company for about 4 years, two part time while I was studying and 2 full time after I got my undergrad. I’m doing my masters now. I feel like I’m being overlooked/ not really valued at work. 

Another girl started part time and then full time the same time I did, got promoted to a supervisor position in a similar department a month into being hired full time because that position opened up. At that time I was lowkey thinking about why I wasn’t even considering for the supervisor position. she worked as a supervisor for two years and then decided to quit. They instead moved her to my department and matched the offer she had and asked her to stay. She did. And she’ll probably be making a lot more than me. Shes not even pursuing her masters. 

They now offered a coworker who was hired in my department (doing the same thing I do) about 6 months ago, the supervisor position in the other department that will open up. she’s older than me so obviously has more years of experience. But again, I wasn’t interested in that position but I wasnt even considered. And someone who started less than 6 months ago is being promoted? what did she do in these 6 months that I haven’t done in the entire time I’ve been here? 

We haven’t wven had our annual reviews yet but have been given a raise (4%). My manager is still waiting to have his review before he can do mine. Recruiters are sending me jobs that are 15k more than what I make now. I just feel undervalued and overlooked agin and again. Advice?

I don’t want to quit because they pay 100% of my masters fees but I also don’t want to work feeling undervalued with pay.",,,,,,,,

Feel inadequate at work,"Hi, 

I am a recent graduate from a top university now working in a very competitive and high pressure environment (corporate law firm). I was excellent academically, largely due to the freedom you have as a law student in my country. 

However, I'm really really bad with practical stuff, even though my life and my career looks so perfect on the outside, I'm super stressed, can't keep my apartment clean, I make silly mistakes in my work, and I just feel that I'm different from other people.

I think this has a lot to do with me being minority and not having many people like me at my firm.

All around me, you see people who are always perfectly dressed, have neat apartments, are super social and extremely hard working and good at their jobs. We have for instance a woman who has two small kids and a husband who is a partner at another law firm... She does perfect work, is almost always available except for when she is eating or putting her kids to bed. Whereas I, single and young, barely manage to keep my life together.

What can I do? Any tips?",,,,,,,,

Advice?,"Advice?

My parents aren’t dating anymore but they still live together. My mom pays for the trash bill. It’s over $100. Mom wasn’t satisfied paying it. I don’t think she was paying it on time either.

My stepfather decided to cancel the internet to pay for the trash. Eventually my mom changed her mind. And she’s paying it again. But the internet got canceled last night.

How to have casual sex without getting attached?,"I’ve been sleeping with a coworker recently and I’m starting to get feelings and I really don’t want to. 

I know with 100% certainty he doesn’t want a relationship. I just got out of a four year relationship so I’m nowhere near ready to start things up again and even if I was I don’t think he and I would be compatible for anything more then sex. Genuinely brain wise I’m not interested in him but emotionally I’m starting to like him for more then just sex. 

That being said that relationship that just ended was horrible and over the past two years we had sex once. I’m enjoying having really good sex and I’d like to be able to continue if possible; and it feels safer to have a casual fling I know and trust vs one night stands or people from dating apps. I think part of the problem is that maybe we’re being too comfortable like we get food together and hang out and acting to much like a couple. Should we stop cuddling after/ him spending the night? How do I do this without getting attached?",,,,,,,,
"Trying to hone in on just one of my 3 major “vibes” or labels or category in who I am as a person and I’m struggling, any advice?","First of all I already do not like labels so that makes it hard in and of itself, though a general “rough draft” is acceptable to me and figure out stuff along the way once I get a better sense. Want to focus on more of the mindfulness, inner peace aspect and the guided meditations I do on Buddhism and learning about that. 

Here are the 3 with examples-

1.Dark Humor fucked up just bitter person honestly very cynical a debby downer, whenever I show up to the party first thing I say is something like “Did you hear about that guy that killed all those kids last week?” Just really had some shitty life experiences so walk around all pissed.
2. Very passionate anti government pro equality and pro revolutionary, I’ll fukn go to war in a guaranteed suicide mission for what I believe is right, every one of the politicians is fucked and honestly I hope an asteroid just lands in congress and White House, very anti religion and a dick about it 
3. Buddhism, meditation, mindfulness, compassion empathy loving kindness, impermanence, balancing emotion, being able to not agree with something or think it is wrong but also not be upset over it 

My therapist and I agree on the idea that they can coexist, though in my mind I am 100% into every one passionately. I go to rally’s and protests and I spend a lot of my free time speaking at non profits and being an advocate for other issues and do stuff like volunteer for suicide helpline and stuff. I am all about free thought as in subreddits about all those things I slightly differ on viewpoints, it seems once an issue is brought up and a group that people use to define themselves as has a majority agreement on if it’s right or not, it is cemented and everyone agrees and changes their viewpoints even sometimes just to fit the group. 

So this is a wholeeeee thing, I just want to focus on one “group” while being open minded and having original thought but get away from the two that are really hurtful for me and focus on the really great one, whilst also being scared of becoming a generic member of a group.

Anyone who has had similar experiences or has some ideas of what I can do to improve my life with this? Thanks. Also you may not agree with one or more of viewpoints stated and that is okay, please don’t look at it with bias or anger, just look at it as a scientific question type of way if the topics annoy you or whatever.",,,,,,,,

How to explain I DIDNT have a good time without embarrassing myself.,"Yesterday I tried ed*bles for the first time and it went horribly. I didn’t think and accidentally took too much and it caused the worst night of my life. 

I started off feeling really weird and just like… well, high, but it gradually got worse and to the point where I had the worst panic attack of my life.

I was panicking and crying, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, I screamed at my husband to call 911. Luckily, he knew I was fine and was just having a bad panic attack and so, after me trying to tell siri to call 911 about 6 times, hid my phone. 

There is so much more to the story, but I’m still feeling a bit panicked talking about it, so I won’t disclose anymore.

My main worry is that my brother in law was the one that suggested it and my mother in law is waiting to try it to see how it made me feel. 

I don’t know how to tell them I didn’t have a good time without embarrassment. They are bound to ask more questions if i just say “it wasn’t fun”, and so I don’t know if I should come up with an excuse or lie and say it was fun but i won’t do it again? 

I don’t know, I worry that my MIL will take it and have a similar reaction as me as we are both being medicated for anxiety, but I know i will be embarrassed forever if i tell the truth and they’ll never let it go.",,,,,,,,

I’m in a tight spot right now, both of my cars have broken down and are over 20 years old, my mechanic says they’re money pits and there’s really no fixing them without spending way way way over what they’re worth. So, I’m leasing a car currently for $374 a month from a friend, under contract,and I can get an auto loan to finance it as soon as I save $1100 for the collection on my credit that my mom lovingly left for me on my birthday. No I can’t get a lawyer and fight it, tried it, wasted money and time as there’s no proof.

Family problems,"Hi guys, I've never posted on Reddit before, so please excuse any rookie mistakes. I have been with my partner for almost 7 years now. They are the absolute love of my life. We are however polar opposite on most ways; including their family too. At the start it was great with their family. I had such a great bond with my partner's brothers in particular. However over the years, I feel like our bonds have become weakened. I no longer feel involved with any dialogue or communication. The only time they seem to make an effort with me is when they want to borrow money or want something. I basically feel invisible and excluded to the point where being in their company for too long just depresses and irritates me. I don't know why they've changed, or if I'm overreacting. I just wondered if anyone has any advice on what to do? Should I cut them out? I find it hard to be myself around them now and I find it hard to fake being someone else in their presence. I would be really grateful to hear any suggestions.",,,,,,,,
Idk what to do. My bf hurt me physically and i don’t think he remembers,"It happened a few months ago, our friends had a party. The party was great. It was on my boyfriends street, so luckily at the end we were able to walk back to his house to sleep. 

Idk what time we got back but it was late. We were both still pretty intoxicated, and we were rly tired as well. I remember getting into bed with him and then I must’ve fallen asleep at some point because the next thing i remember is waking up to him inside me. 

I didn’t want him there. But I was so drunk that I didn’t even fully realize it happened until it was over so i couldn’t tell him I didn’t want it. I wasn’t upset I just figured he didn’t rly realize what he was doing either

But then it (my area) started to burn really bad because I hadn’t been aroused at all- seeing as I was asleep, and then I was scared. The burning made me rly scared and I started to cry from the pain &amp; fear. I woke him up in the hopes he would get me ice or even just comfort me. Instead he got mad that I woke him and told me to go to sleep. I tried explaining I was really in pain but he got more mad. I tried to cuddle with him but I couldn’t stop crying so he even yelled at me to leave him alone and go sleep on the spare bed if i couldn’t stop crying.

I couldn’t get ice for myself because I mightve woken his mom up by going upstairs &amp; I wasnt comfortable explaining why I crying, or making up an excuse. It also hurt to even move. I fell asleep in pain after crying by myself for a long time while he slept peacefully next to me.

The next morning I woke up still hurting and started researching ways to fix it. I was waiting &amp; mentally preparing for him to wake up and yell at me more. But when he was waking up, he cuddled up to me. Then when he was awake, he started talking to me happily &amp; normally as if nothing happened. 

I was taking him to a late lunch for his birthday that day. He was sick on his actual birthday and I didn’t want to ruin another day for him by being upset about what he did to me. We went to lunch like normal. 

I’ve never mentioned it to this day. I really don’t think he remembers it. I’m also his girlfriend, so i don’t know if it’s okay for me to be upset about it. Idk why I’m posting this. I haven’t been able to tell anyone so i think i just need an outlet. I don’t plan on telling him. It was months ago now but sometimes I do get scared sleeping around him now and I mentally prepare myself to be woken up. 

I don’t know what to do. I rly don’t think he remembers &amp; he didn’t mean to hurt me but it was still wrong. I think if i mention it he might say I’m lying since he can’t remember &amp; since it was months ago.",,,,,,,,
Outgrowing best friend?,"I have known my best friend (28) since 2018. We have worked the past 3 jobs together but we don’t currently work together. She has been in a relationship for 10 years and has a 3 year old. Her boyfriend cheated on her during the early years of their relationship and she later find out, broke up and then she took him back. She got pregnant soon after getting back with him and then things were okay. However, for the past 1.5 years or so she has told me that their relationship isn’t the same and she resents him for cheating. She also says that he doesn’t put in as much effort as before and if he does it is out of obligation. I have advised her to communicate with her partner how she feels but she said she doesn’t feel comfortable. Instead she will write something on Twitter in hopes he checks it and figure something is wrong. She also talks to another guy from another state that she has know for over a decade. They have never met each other in person but they met virtually through a chat room and have talked on and off since. He is 28 and has two kids (one he doesn’t have a relationship with). He is also in a relationship and claims he is unhappy. My best friend and him send each other inappropriate photos and she confides more with him than her partner. This guy also only has a part time job and has mental issues. She believes she would want to try out a relationship with him ideally but said she is insecure with herself and needs to lose weight before ever letting him see her in person. I have told her that maybe this is not a good idea and that if she is unhappy with her situation she should end it with her boyfriend. She says she cannot afford to live on her own financially and I have offered her to temporarily live at my place or suggested asking her other best friend. I also suggested her moving back in with her parents and she says there isn’t enough room. I told her it will be a slight adjustment for the time being but if you are miserable this may be the way to go. She is also boy crazy and waves hi to a guy that works next door to her, she has worked at this place for the last three years and has not even spoken one word to this guy but will basically update me everyday saying oh he waved at me today or oh he ignored me today. 

I’m getting exhausted hearing the same issues and boy crazy stories all the time. I feel like I cannot relate to her and we are just at different phases in life. I have a college degree (not that is an indication of anything but she has told me it’s just a waste of money in her opinion). When discussing life plans I have said I want to get married and she says that it’s just a piece of paper and a waste of money. She has said that marriage is a big commitment but in my opinion having a child with someone is a lifelong commitment.

Im tired of surface level conversations and hearing about the same issues for the last year or so. How can I be a good friend in this situation without building up resentment?",,,,,,,,

Failing 2nd year uni twice,"Please help what do I do

I did great in GCSEs, and second year a levels I fucked up and did terrible. Tried retaking, COVID happened and got given shit grades based off my last set. Which was really unfair. 

Went to a shit uni doing mathematics and theoretical physics. 1st year was piss cuz it was all online, didn't attend any sessions and did well. 

2nd year I had a major operation, got really depressed, didn't attend, failed all but one module. I was really not enjoying the course and wanted to drop out but got persuaded to retake the year.

Now I'm retaking the year, I've been lazy and I just really dislike the course.Ive failed 1/5 modules, the other 4 I have done poorly in small exams so I can still pass If I study really hard.

I've also not been attending lessons, 90% I've missed.

Studying a subject I hate, plus the massive commute to the school just made it such a pain. Though me failing this year was laziness. Can't blame lady luck this time.

I'm about 70% sure I will at least pass if I just study all day. 

It's a combination of bad luck, poor decisions, and laziness. I don't know what to do. Part of me really really wants to do another course and start fresh. I know I might fall into the same trap, but I feel strongly university is my only option. 

But I'm 22. How can I be starting an undergrad degree now. Plus I have student loans gone.

FFS I'm just so stressed, wasted money and time. I've been working part time so I've got money saved up but still. 

Seeing people from my college now 22, graduated from better unis and working professional jobs just makes me so depressed. I feel like my life is done. Destined for manual labour, however long that lasts. If I can even find a job, there's more than enough people willing to work minimum wage with terrible hours.

I wish I knew how important ages 17-21 were. 

Q: Should I just grind and try to pass my 2nd year? I'm worrying that the 3rd year might be a lot harder 

Or should I just drop out and apply for another course fresh start. Academic shit is the only thing I was even slightly good at. I can't start a business or do a trade.

IM JUST NOT SURE IF I CAN PASS, GIVEN I HAVE MISSED SO MUCH OF THE YEAR. IM AFRAID OF SPENDING 12HRS A DAY STUDYING FROM NOW TO JULY AND STILL FAILING. AAAAAAH",,,,,,,,

How do I become more comfortable in social gatherings?,"Ever since I was a child I always felt a bit insecure, awkward and uncomfortable in social gatherings filled with people I don't know. I've always been the kind of person that is not quick to go and socialize with any and everyone...I prefer people to come to me and begin conversation and I'm usually a good conversationalist. 

I'm just afraid of going up to people to randomly strike up conversations and they feel I'm too boring or lame. I fear rejection and feel it's a possibility and can happen through various circumstances. I prefer making friendships and relationships one on one instead of going around and trying to find who I can be cool with. It's really easy for me to be social or friendly if people are coming to an event that I am the leader of or hosting. But if it's vice versa it gets a little harder.

I find that people who are hosting events or are very familiar with the environment that an event is being hosted in are not as friendly and accommodating to new people compared to me. But whenever I'm in their shoes I am the opposite, especially with new coming members or people at work.

I feel a lot of people aren't attracted to quiet people... And I'm not intentionally quiet (although I'm naturally calm) I just don't like being too social with people I don't really know yet. I'm actually a very friendly and silly person and have a lot of personality and thoughts when I open up and get comfortable with people.

But I wish I was more bold and outgoing at social gatherings where I'M the stranger like my younger brother. He can easily socialize in new environments while I sit back and watch everything happening, hoping that someone would come up to me and strike a conversation.",,,,,,,,
Genuinely cannot find a job.,"I’m 19 and studying at college and I decided it would be a good time now to get a part-time job so I could at least start making a bit of money.

I’ve started searching for part time jobs since at-least December and have found absolutely NONE. Here are some of my issues I keep facing;

1) I would apply on Indeed and never get a response back

2) On indeed I’m going up against 500 other candidates (just for a store assistant role) how are they even going to get a chance to see my CV? 

3) I was close to getting a part time job via friend but his company keeps airing my application… like I was meant to have a meeting with them nearly 1 month ago but they’ve gone radio silent. This one here was the closest I’ve gotten.

Do I give my addict mum a chance or am I only asking for drama and headaches ?,"I’ll try to keep it short and include relevant info, if I skip any details that may be important feel free to ask. Also sorry for format, I’m on mobile. 

So my mum is a drug addict, always has been my whole life. I was raised by my dad and I saw her maybe once every few years when she bothered to show up. Whenever she did show up it was always dramas or her stealing from our house. In my last year of primary school she started staying in touch over letters and phone calls a lot but she was always crying or sounded sad. I found out later that she was in jail for manslaughter/murder. 

She got out afew years later and my grandfather let her live with him so I could have somewhat of a relationship with her. This lasted a couple years, ended extremely sour between her and my pop due to her insanity. In her room I found an entire box of used needles. I am one of 6 children of hers and I only know one because they’re all in foster homes, I will likely never know them. 

The last time I saw her was 10+ years ago. Sometimes out of the blue she will create a fb account and message me and it just starts drama over nothing, stresses me out and is not enjoyable or even logical. One night I was having a moment and realised she is going to die likely of an overdose and I will probably never know. This got me sentimental and I reached out to her. 

Ever since then she is messaging me every few months but just carrying on and, we’ll being herself really. I made the mistake of letting her know I was doing well for myself and she has hinted at living with me afew times. 

Every logical inch of me tells me to cut this woman off. In truth I barely know her and what I do know i am not a fan of. There’s just a tiny voice I have saying to give her a chance in case I regret it later in life. 

Am I crazy for even considering? I’ll attach pics of her most recent messages if it lets me, for some context and understanding on what I’m dealing with here.",,,,,,,,

I was in a relationship at the time -and we connected well, but we just stayed friends as part of a big friend group etc &amp; seeing each other at parties etc. Nothing ever transpired at that time romantically between us. In this larger friend group there were a few guys who I became somewhat close with ..and through time I learned that one of these guys who was married.. would kinda take every opportunity to hook up with other women. I remember he would sneekily grab womens asses during group photos and message women privately in seemingly innocent ways but there was always that kind of underlying .. trying to hook up kind of motive tbh I never really thought much of it at the time aside from just thinking hes ""that kind"" of guy. Fast forward 2 years and my wife and I are together..&amp; married now.. and these friend groups are still in tact ..and this guys is still doing his thing. While having beers one day he admits to me a bunch of this stuff saying hes not the good person people think he is and tells me that he hooked up with one of our friends wives while her husband was passed out in another room etc. Hearing all this made me kind of hyper aware that this guy is willing to hook up with even his friends wives…and since then Ive noticed that whenever we hang out as a group with wives included .. this guy always gets this like hyper outgoing energy and is super keen to be near and talk to my wife constantly. She is aware of ""how he is"".. but my wife isnt one to shy away from a conversation for those reasons and he is certainly willing to provide that so the two kind of carry on etc. This guy and I have somewhat grown apart as friends in the last little while..possibly partly due to my awareness ..and insecurity in the whole thing... but also because we just were mostly drinking friends and lacked any real connection. He still asks us to go out.. and its always a ""bring your wife"" type invite... sometimes just with him and sometimes with him and his wife...So reddit...is this the kind of friendship you would maintain?",,,,,,,,

Job Interview leaves me very confused,"Hello, to start, I am relatively young and still in college. I will be graduating in December. So I have been looking for a part-time job, and just today had an interview for a part-time teller position. During my interview, I mentioned a couple of times I plan to one day work as a financial advisor when I graduate, alongside my other family members that are also financial advisors. The interview went great. I think I got the job primarily because of this last detail that happened at the end of the interview, which left me completely lost and confused. At the end of the interview, the Branch Manager gave me his business card, wrote on it his personal cell phone number, and said, ""call or text me anytime."" 

Now what does that mean, and what am I supposed to do?

Is he trying to be friends with me because of my connections with my other family members being financial advisors and wants to have that asset as a part of his network?

Is he just being courteous and wanting to mentor me?

I am trying to understand what it means. I am sorry if this is a stupid question; I am young and new to this business world and just want to understand what this is.",,,,,,,,

Father takes my whole salary.,"M24 here, living in Europe/Balkans/SRB/N. Macedonia, my parents are divorced I live with my father In N.Macedonia.

I've been working since 14, and all this time whenever I take my salary I must give it to him, even the last cent.(Haven't worked the last year/June) 

I've tried talking to him, no success. His ""my roof my rules"" are undestructible. He is a very stubborn man, that's why mom left.

I don't know what to do. In anger to him I haven't worked the last year in June, but I know I'm just wasting my life away if I just stay home and do nothing.

I don't spend my money on bs, I just wanna save some money get a car, driving license, a pc and many stuff..

Asking a celebrity to hangout?¿ general advice,"Soo I recently have been having a dilemma if I should shoot my shot and ask a celebrity to hangout/get coffee.

They really liked it and even replied to my dm saying it was the greatest thing ever. Fast forward I saw them again a couple weeks ago at a small concert and I got to talk to them and gave them another small gift. They were really sweet about it.

Why do people not connect with me (F21)?,"I’m currently a college student planning to graduate in a month. Around age 13, I began to notice that others had very little interest in being friends with me.
Prior to age 13, I was slightly on the shyer side, but had many friends.


After age 13, my friends dwindled down until I had about 1 friend I saw occasionally. She was semi popular and all of her friends had no interest in me.
I was never bullied, just ignored. I developed extremely low self esteem and social anxiety. I withdrew for most of my high school years, simply because it seemed nearly impossible to make friends.


When I got older, I began to notice whenever I would speak to someone with another person, they would rarely if ever look at or make eye contact with me. So, I began to assume people didn’t like me because I was unattractive.


I take care of myself physically, I have passions and interests, I try to show excitement when I speak to people, I have a great understanding (in my opinion) of social skills, so I don’t understand why I’m having this problem. 

Now in my senior year of college, I have virtually no friends. At work, I’m left out my colleagues and ignored. People take no interest in asking me about myself, I’m always the one asking others questions about their lives.

While I admit I can be shy, I’ve made major strides in my social anxiety disorder and am not currently diagnosed with it. Freshman year of college I join a knitting club and attended sessions for months, never making a single friend. 


What seems like constant invalidation just confirms the negative thoughts I hold about myself. It’s incredibly difficult to believe I am beautiful or worthy when I’ve never been hit on, never been to a party, never been asked to hang out, outside of school or work in years.

I want to know what I can change. I am not someone who lacks social skills, I care about and engage with others well. I want to know why I seem to make others uncomfortable. Why others have a hard time looking me in the eye.

Any advice is appreciated.",,,,,,,,
How to handle mom insisting I call my dad for his birthday and name day even though I genuinely don't want to?,"My dad was not a good father. He was abusive, he hit me on several occasions, he yelled at both my mom and i every single day, made my mom cry, he was and is an alcoholic, and almost drove us into the ground financially. When my mom had to borrow money from neighbors to literally buy bread he was still secretly going and buying alcohol. My mom stayed and she still there. He's old now and less aggressive, doesn't have the energy to be. Depressed and sick, because he ruined his own body. 
Now, many of these things are not uncommon at all in my country, the alcoholic asshole dad is almost a stereotype. But that doesn't make it ok and it certainly doesn't excuse anything.

I don't live at home anymore, I'm 29, and honestly I avoid visiting them and instead just have my mom come over. I never call my dad or speak to him unless I have to. 

Every single year my mom is incessant that I call my dad for his name day, his birthday, for Christmas and New years. I don't want to. I don't think he deserves it and it should be *my decision* either way. I tell her I'll just send him a text and that's that. Still, most times I give in and I call him. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but I hate it. I hate having to call and pretend I'm actually wishing him a happy birthday and good health and what have you, and having to listen to him say whatever he has to say.

My mom insists that ""I need to forgive him *for me* so I can move on"" - like... Okay sure I'll do that on my own terms, and if he's dead by then that's okay with me. But using that to get me to call him? I don't understand. Why does she insist I do this to such extent? She literally doesn't leave me alone until I feel bad and call him. What does she have to gain from this? She knows he was a terrible father and husband. She knows I don't want anything to do with him. I don't care that he's sick and sad. He did that to his own damn self and I'm not responsible for making it better.

How the hell do I handle this and make it stop? The guilting, the insistence. My mom isn't like this about a lot of things. But this, she just won't accept.",,,,,,,,

"I got catfished and I should’ve caught on earlier, but now I wanna find out who I’ve actually been talking to",So I just moved to this state and I started following people on instagram from around here and I stumbled upon a girl who I started texting immediately. She answered and we continued talking. I was suspicious at first because some of the earlier posts on the page were posted right after each other but they all looked legit and they had a lot of followers and actively posted on their story so I didn’t further question it. They would text all throughout the day and it didn’t seem suspicious to me anymore. Eventually we exchanged pics and the ones she sent seemed so thought out and it hit me that she might have a secret only fans but just didn’t promote it on her personal page. After trying to look for it I came up with nothing. This was all in the period of like 4 months and last week I realized that the person had blocked me. I brushed it off but then I started to think back at the first suspicions I had and I went down a rabbit hole and eventually I found the real person who is A pretty popular only fans creator.

I got a job offer with a $40k increase and I don’t know if I should take it.,"Some background: I used to work for a company that required me to work abroad for 6+ months a year. I did this job for many years and after starting a family decided to find a job with more stability to be home with my family daily. Eventually landed a job 6 months ago. What they are paying me now is large decrease from what I made prior but we’re still comfortable after making some budgeting changes. I am definitely at the bottom of the totem pole here. Overall, it’s a really great company, they treat their employees well, and have some really good benefits. I have a lot of potential here and there is a lot of upward growth. I enjoy my colleagues and seem to have a good relationship with many of the senior members at the company. Many of whom who have voiced “I have a bright future here.”


On to where I need advice. I got a cold call 2 days ago from my former employer offering me a senior manager position in a more stable position where I could telework. It would give me managerial experience that I know I need on my resume. It comes with a $40k pay increase with bonuses. I left the company on good terms and had a conversation last night with the guy who is leaving the position (he’s a friend from college luckily). He was happy in his job but wanted to go somewhere with more upward mobility. The gist is that the company is changing a lot of things and from friends that I used to work with have stories about how they arnt treating some employees as well as they used to. This job wouldn’t come with as many benefits and is a much smaller company so there’s really very small room for upward momentum. Having this type of managerial experience would look really good on a resume and could help me transfer to another company after a few years.

Overall, it would take many years for the company I am at to reach the salary I was just offered. However, I had friends and former colleagues help get me the position I’m in now so it would be burning some bridges unfortunately. I also am very happy with where I am at. But the opportunity is proving hard to pass up between telework and the pay increase, even if just for a few years. Since I am so new at the company I don’t foresee showing them this opportunity to be beneficial to me in any way, regardless of the fact that I was not searching for another position elsewhere. I would hate to bring it up and lose both opportunities. 

I would love some outside options on this. I’m giving myself a few days to mull it over before I decide any opinions or advice is welcome!",,,,,,,,
Did people really forget about sexual diseases?,"
I don’t fully understand this hook up culture that’s going on now a days.

People having sex a lot and with a lot of people.

But it seems like everyone from about sexual diseases! Yes, you could wear a condom that could possibly prevent transmission but what about oral sex?

You could still catches diseases by giving or receiving oral sex. There’s no condoms for that. And oral sex is a regular thing now a days.

So, I’m just confused a little, why isn’t there ever a topic or concern about that.

How come there is never any topic about getting tested before having sex with someone new?! It’s always just straight to the point of fucking, no discussions or concerns.

Just fucking or sucking. 

It’s even against the law for someone who knows they are infected and not warn someone before having sex or oral sex. 

Imagine this as a guy or girl; 

you’re out and met a guy or girl, started talking for a while and eventually sex become a topic or is about to happen; even if he have a condom, what about oral sex? Aren’t you concerned?",,,,,,,,

Should I stand up to my bully,"I’m 16m and this all started when there was this girl who I really liked. We’d been on and off for over a year and I’d say she was my best friend. I had this friend who knew how much I liked her and I’d always tell him about her. 
He went behind my back and started dating her even though he knew I wasn’t okay with it. I still rlly liked her so obviously this was very difficult and to make matters worse I have to sit next to her in one of my classes.
Things got worse when he started making nasty comments about her body and said he wanted to cheat on her. 
I got drunk at a party and ended up telling her everything since we’d become friends. Ik this was quite bad of me to do but I don’t think I was in the wrong.
To cover it up he told everyone that I made up to sabotage them and that I was obsessed and crazy, however she eventually found out and broke up with him.
Things got real complicated when they stayed dating again a month later. Ever since all of this he’s constantly tried to belittle me and always calls me stuff like f*gg*t in class.
For example recently he made up that he dumped her so that I’d try and get with her but get rejected. He got everyone else to go along with it although I didn’t believe it and I don’t even like her anymore.
Sorry for the long explanation but I’m honestly so fed up of him. I have a friend who said he’d beat him up for me but if I’m resorting to violence I may as well do it myself?

So here is the thing, she never messages me first, if I don’t initiate. I think i should cut her off. Maybe it will spark my purpose. Cause right, having her is nice and comfy. I am thinking that i didn’t have her, if I was actively pursuing other women my motivation might be back. Or is it my unmotivated delirium talking?",,,,,,,,

Funeral advice.,"Sorry for bringing this here on a Friday. 

I’ve gone through a lot of loss throughout my teenage years, when I was 16 I had to sit with my grandmother as she literally passed away in front me of me, a month after that my aunt I was really close to passed away unexpectedly. I went through my first funeral so quickly and had to literally go to another a few weeks after. 

I grew up really rough and recently my grandfather passed away, and my last remaining grandma I had passed away after I took care of her too, she was really ill. 

My family has been nonstop fighting and I don’t cry as much anymore, I wasn’t invited to my grandfathers funeral because I’m gay and hadn’t been on good terms with my family (despite me taking care of him until he passed), and I never got that closure. I just recently stopped having weird crying spells about not getting closure. 

Now my family hadn’t told me when the funeral was going to be for my grandmother until last minute, I just found out yesterday that it’s tomorrow (Saturday), I don’t have clothes that are on theme as I am saving money, and quite frankly don’t even want to attend and be ridiculed for not having the funds to afford clothes. (I take care of my deceased grandparents’ cat, my dog and bills, and college). 

I prayed over my grandmother the day she passed, cried once and really unfortunately don’t handle loss well, I’m not numb because I’m not caring. I just really am desensitized to death. I’ve worked hospice jobs, watched pets die, taboo horror films, death just is another thing to me and I hate to think I’m being disrespectful by missing this funeral but realistically it’s more so for the family than for the person who passed in my opinion.

(Sorry for the rant.) I just really don’t want to seem terrible, death just isn’t something I want to go spend hundreds on for one day (the theme they picked is expensive and color coded)",,,,,,,,
Coming to terms with my sexuality?,"Hey yall, I've been having this internal battle with myself for a long time now and I just don't know what to do. I'd like to preface this with an apology in case anything I say is offensive, as I'm not too educated in anything LGBT related. Anyways,

I say that I'm straight but deep down I know that I'm not. I haven't really had feelings for another woman per se, but I've imagined myself in a lesbian relationship several times and the idea has appealed to me. Some female friends have helped me experiment and I didn't mind that either. The thing is, for some reason I just can't bring myself to accept it. My family isn't homophobic and neither are any of my friends (not that that'd sway me), I don't have any trauma relating to something like this, and I have nothing against the LGBT community and I support it. There's literally nothing that'd give me a reason to reject being homosexual, but I can't come to terms with it. Is this normal? What should I do?",,,,,,,,
Unrequited feelings: should I tell her what’s going on or back away silently?,"I (31M) moved across the country about 9 months ago. About a month in a met a girl on a swipe site. She’s cute, funny, and really charismatic. We dated for like 3-4 months (non-exclusively) when she rather suddenly lost interest. But we’ve still talked every day since we met. It hurt pretty bad and I had trouble moving on.

So I started seeing a therapist and just doing my best to move forward. Fast forward to about 2 months ago, she takes an interest again and we start hooking up. We went on other dates but it came back to just us, and things felt more “couple-like”, however she made it clear (in words rather than actions) that she doesn’t see things that way in reality. I don’t think this registered with me on an emotional level, because she started talking to a dude that ghosted her a year ago. At a party earlier this week she was pretty drunk and was flirting with him and asked to see him soon.

I was pretty hurt. I feel discarded and cast aside, like I’m just a place holder. I’ve been a wreck all week about this. That night I decided to start distancing myself from her and it’s been hard. Not burning a bridge, just traveling it less often. She knew something was up almost immediately and asked if she did anything wrong. Technically, I don’t think she did, because of the nature of our relationship. Objectively she hasn’t done anything wrong.

I’m questioning whether or not to tell her why I’ve been feeling the way I’ve been. I don’t want to ruin a friendship but I also don’t know if I can handle one when I get upset when she’s sees other people. Maybe the wound is just too new again?

It doesn’t help that she’s basically my biggest connection to a social life here (making friends as an adult is hard).


Do I distance myself? Do I do it nonchalantly or be honest about what’s happened in my head?

TLDR: Off and on girl doesn’t feel the same way I do and it hurts. Do I distance myself silently or tell her?",,,,,,,,
How to get taller?,"For humility's sake I'm using a throwaway account.

Allow me to provide some context:

I'm a 17-year-old guy not-so-proudly standing at 5'4 (5'5 on a good day). Two years ago I had corrective spinal surgery for my lifelong scoliosis, and this is the only time I've had a growth ""spurt."" By that, I mean I gained 3 whole inches. Crazy. My family's around average height but my brother towers over me at 6'0. Why was I dealt the bad hand when it came to genetics?

I've always been insecure about my size. I've hated my dainty hands and my short but slender fingers, my lanky figure, my goddamn baby face. The only thing I have of value on me is a 6-pack I'm not sure how I got. Hell, I'd always get teased for being the oldest in my classes yet somehow being the shortest.

I've also had problems with my weight for as long as I can recall. We're talking 15-20 lbs underweight for the last few years. I'm unable to gain no matter how much I eat and because of that I have zero strength since I'm mainly bones. I'm attributing this to some undiagnosed GI issue but I've been in contact with several specialists to figure it out. I still exercise almost daily but that's not doing much for me.

People keep telling me that to grow I need to gain weight, but my efforts are futile. I mean, I'm at this age where I'm most likely not developing anymore, though I'm trying to keep my hopes up since I'm a late bloomer. I guess what really bothers me is that my girlfriend is 4 inches taller than me so I know I'll never be able to hug her from behind as I've always wanted to do without looking like a lost child who finally reunited with his mother. Nothing against unconventional height differences in partners, but I personally would prefer being at least the same height.

It's just not fair. How can I grow at this point? I know height surgeries exist but to my knowledge they're quite risky and I'd rather save the stress/money on studying/living abroad. I don't mind waiting until I'm 18 to start doing things, as long as there's some hope.

All advice is immensely appreciated. Thanks.",,,,,,,,
does this count as ghosting?,"
Spoke to someone on an app and almost immediately he asked me out on a date. We had a good phone call and he reiterated he wanted the date and how much he’s looking forward to it. I was travelling to his city anyway so I extended my trip a little to see him. We set a day and he said if I’m there both days we can make a weekend out of it. The issue is he barely texted me. He read and ignored my messages at least three times and I had to double text at points. He would only text or call late at night. We confirmed again on another phone call and he said I can send him my schedule. The week prior to meeting I told him I have got my schedule ready and asked for him to call. He didn’t. I called the next day but he said he’s at work. I messaged later that night and he apologised saying he’s delayed with a deadline at work and he’ll reply the next day. The next day came and he didn’t. I noticed he was online. I messaged him with my times the next day but he read it and didn’t reply. The night before we were supposed to meet I noticed he was online again with no response. Truthfully the whole week i has felt really anxious because of this situation. I was tired of it and I sent him a message wishing him the best and unmatched. Is this an example of ghosting or should I have given him another chance or call. I did. think I liked him",,,,,,,,
"My 19 yr old daughter is dating an abusive, cheating, drug dealer who is a pathetic excuse for a man but sees no problem with it. How can I protect her?","For starters, he is 28 years old and she met him through her friend group. Why is a 28 year old man hanging around a friend group who are no older than 19. 

The difference in maturity, perspective in life and goals should not even come close to equating at that age gap which already told me everything about him when I found out. Speaking to my wife and daughter I've come to learn he grows and sells weed in his parents back yard (yes he still lives with his parents as well) and carries a gun on him constantly. I am terrified of who he puts my daughter around that he'd feel the need to hide a weapon everywhere he goes. To keep this short, my daughter also found out he has slept with her close friend on numerous ocassions but has chosen to forgive him.

My daughter is a sweet girl, very intelligent and driven but has a tendancy of getting caught up in a bad crowd in pursuit of being popular with the ""cool"" kids. I can't help but blame myself for going wrong somewhere that she would even consider this type of man but right now I just need advice on how I can protect her from getting seriously hurt. We have tried talking to her, but don't want to revert to chid-like punishments such as grounding taking her phone away etc but honestly I am at that point. She is very open to us and will many times say these things causually which is why we know so much, but I am just horrified that she is in this situation and keeps herself in it.

How do I (22F) get over my boyfriend's (27M) 'history'?,"I've been dating my boyfriend ""R"" for about 4 years now, and it's been going well. I've been going to college so I only get to see him on weekends. R has had a rough past before me and got into a lot of trouble in his teen years, but he has grown up out of that. 

While everything else has been good, there's been a weird gap that I really am dumbfounded about, I can't tell really if I'm going insane or gaslighted or what.

Before this, we've had conversations about it and from what I remember he said he had only been with his girlfriends. I told him what I thought, but he denied it and told me that he said this to me before and I reacted the same way. We argued for a while and it has been tearing me apart since.

I feel very shocked and insane and I'm not sure how to get over this. I'm very avoidant about confrontation so I really don't want to even bring it up to him again and start an argument. 

Basically, I'm trying to ask for advice to help get over this situation because whenever I'm with him, I think about all the past girls he's been with and feel hella insecure. I get scared that he's still thinking about those other girls, or comparing me with them. I don't want to break up with him because still I love him, but I think about it quite a lot and it kind of has killed my confidence. I doubt asking for reassurance would even help my anxiety over this.",,,,,,,,
I want to help my girlfriends eating disorder but I feel like I can’t,"Hi, for context we are both 18. She has arfid which is from my knowledge avoidance of certain foods to an extreme level. She eats almost the same food every day. Her arfid has been undiagnosed since childhood (still refusing to get a diagnosis but there’s no doubt she has it as her symptoms match it almost exactly). She’s recently been worried about her abnormally high heart rate and has seen a doctor who was incredibly shocked by this and ordered her to see a cardiologist, which she has not booked an appointment with because the wait list is about a year, which frustrates me because I think it would be helpful for her because she constantly worries about her health. I only mention this as this from my research seems to be a common problem with people with arfid, that they can seem healthy on the outside but not inside. This makes me worry about her future, that she might face other health related problems because of her very restrictive diet. I’ve mentioned numerous times trying to get support and help recover from it because I know long term this cannot be healthy, but it always feels selfish as if I’m pushing her to seek help when she doesn’t want it. This makes me feel pretty helpless and I don’t really know what to do, I think she underestimates the importance of eating a wide variety of foods and thinks she doesn’t really have a problem. But maybe I’m viewing it wrong but I just want her to be healthy. Any advice appreciated!",,,,,,,,
What to do about family excluding me from the family business?,"So, my parents own a small business and my siblings works for the business as well. They are poised to take over running the business. As a result, they are all very connected and see each other all the time and are involved in each other's lives.

I could have chosen to work for the business too, but it really isn't for me and I don't think I could stand working with them, tbh.

I went in a different direction with my career and while I think the choice was right for me, I feel very much like an outsider and disconnected from my family as it is. On top of that I'm very different in other ways too (politics, religion, etc). I'm gay and they only marginally are okay with that. I'm 100% the black sheep.

Recently my dad told me he was planning to split all the company stock between all my siblings - except me - this year. Tbh, this feels like being disinherited while my parents are still alive. I don't really care about the money, but it feels like a slap to the face. I'm not part of the family.

Anyways, I told my dad that was fine, but I would no longer be talking to any of them. I'm being called an asshole, but this just feels like the final straw. I've had to consider their concerns my whole life, but they don't care about me. I'm tired of it.

Should I stop talking to them? Am I overreacting? What should I do here. After my dad told me this, it just upset me so deeply. My siblings didn't really do anything wrong, but it feels like it would be impossible to only have contact with them since they are all so grouped together.",,,,,,,,

I (39M) was assaulted by my (33F) girlfriend and have been socially/professionally shunned as a result. What do I do next?,"The below events happened last week:

&amp;#x200B;

I (39M) had an argument with my (33F) girlfriend in the early evening to do with our ex-partners' involvement in our lives (we both have kids but my gf and I have none with each other), we spoke about it again just before bed and everything seemed okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Hours later, in bed, she started sobbing uncontrollably. I asked what was wrong, she said she 't okay but she would be okay. I put my arm around her and told her we could work our issues out, her response was to bite me. Not a superficial bite either, she ripped a chunk out of my arm and while I lay reeling, trying to figure out what in Hell had just happened, she rained punches down on me and a hard slap to the side of the head. More than ten, less than twenty, I'm not sure of the exact number though.

&amp;#x200B;

I stumbled out of bed and onto the floor bleeding all over the place, she began to scream at me and I couldn't really make out what she was saying (as I would find out later, she'd damaged my eardrum with the slap) and threw both soft bags and hard suitcases at me. Some time passed and I cannot remember even vaguely how long this was or why, the world spun too fast for me to focus at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I snapped back into some semblance of common sense when I heard her rummaging through one of the cutlery drawers in the kitchen downstairs because I had an idea of what was coming next. I grabbed her around the waist before she finished her search and threw her down on the sofa before an awkward straddle with me on top, holding her hands down. She then bit a chunk out of my hand. I do remember putting my hand over her throat but I didn't have any strength in me at this point to exert any pressure. While I hate that it had to go that far and I feel like an absolute monster for it, it's like that moment snapped her out of whatever trip she was on.

&amp;#x200B;

The night ended shortly afterwards for me as everything went black and I faintly remember falling over onto the floor. I woke up the next morning, still on the floor. She had showered and gotten ready for the day as though nothing had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

In the days since, I've been beside myself for what I actually did toward the end of that exchange. She's confirmed both to myself and some of her closer friends that she went to the kitchen drawer because she was planning to stab me.

&amp;#x200B;

While I won't disclose what I do for a living, I cannot accept any work as my face, my ability to hear and my hands are basically what makes my money and this is going to take a few weeks if not months to recover from while she's physically unscathed and living life as normal again. As the story becomes more widely known, I've had my car sprayed with the term ""WBA"" (wife beaters' association) and been blackballed/cut from almost all existing work I had prior to last week. and nobody wants anything to do with me.  


I know you guys are only seeing my side of this story, but where to from here? How in Hell do I rebuild my name/image (without these, I have vastly diminished income) and how do I keep this girl away from me?",,,,,,,,
Am I being rude for asking my coworkers to stop vaping in the canteen?,"I recently joined a new job and everything has been going well. The canteen and the workplace is nice and clean. After a whole day of work I sit in the canteen to relax and have some food. Few mins later some staff (mostly teenagers) will come in and start vaping out of nowhere without little consideration to the sorrounding. Now some of them says that the manager despite disallowing smoking, they allow vaping. I asked this girl, “ would you not smoking here? I have asthma and breathing difficulties.” She replies,”well I have asthma too. Asthma doesn’t make you uncomfortable for vaping. But smoking does”. And then I said,” well idk… it still makes me uncomfortable…” and then says fair enough and still keeps on vaping. 
Idk what to do in this situation because later that night I had a full blown asthma attack please help me.",,,,,,,,
I think my sister might secretly hate me,"TLDR; I think my sister secretly resents me and dislikes me. 

Hello,

I'm a 20F and I have an older sister (28F). 

We've gotten along fine pretty much all of our childhood and she was actually ver protective of me growing up. We kinda distanced ourselves from each other with time because of our age gap and the fact that we pretty much have been in different stages of our lives every time. 

As adults we haven't been that close because I'm a college student and she already has a kind of ""married"" life in another city and a secure job. 

However, in the past few years her relationship with me has kind of shifted... She's a very blunt person by nature, specially since starting a job in a big company where she needs to be assertive to be taken seriously. That never bothered me that much because that's just her personality and I can be very deadpan too in spite of the fact that I'm a sensitive person. Nevertheless, she's been making these kind of passive aggressive digs about myself, my image, my personality and my body. At first I thought she was just joking and doing sister stuff, but she has never been one to make fun of my appearance. It got to a point where as soon as I see her the first comment she makes is always about how there's something wrong with my face, hair, whatever.

She goes to the gym and is thicker than I am, so she's constantly making fun of my lack of curves, ass, saying certain clothes woukd look better on her than me, etc. I'm slimmer than her, but I have bigger boobs, so whenever I borrow one of her shirts she always complains I'm going to stretch them out. 

I don't mean to sound conceited in the slightest, but growing up, even though she's always been the smart over achiever and the favourite in the family that has the ""real"" college degree and ""perfect life"", people would always brag about how beautiful I was/was going to be, how slim and elegant I was and how I would have an easier life. Even growing up she was always saying how I should model and how pretty she thought I was. 

But now, all these years later, our relationship really makes me sad. I'm someone who struggles with mental health issues and my self esteem isn't great also, and hearing these kinds of comments coming from my sister really affects me. She's always saying I dress poorly, saying I have huge boobs and no butt, complaining about her ""thickness"" but later saying her bf is always assuring her that men prefer curves whenever anyone compliments me and my figure... Always bragging about her being the ""intelligent and interesting one"" and me being ""the pretty one"" and being kind of angry whenever someone compliments my intellegence and talks about how cultured I am. 

I'm scared this is all in my head because I'm never the one to think the worst about people and I just always assumed it was some stupid sister bickering, but it's really getting to me. She's always been the great achiever of the family, the one the parents are proud of, that makes good money and has always done what she's told, so I don't understand the need to make me feel like garbage. She makes me feel like a garbage hole to look at and not a very smart one either. 

Am I just overreacting? Is she bitter? I've tried to talk to her but my family isn't the type one could just talk to about sensitive matters.",,,,,,,,

Advice on fitting in the workplace when the big guy doesn't like you,"So there's this one guy in my work who doesn't like me, but he doesn't hate me either. He doesn't like me for something I did back then. I wouldn't usually care, but it's kinda isolating me. I didn't hear anything but my guts tells me he talks behind my back. I can feel it with the way we interact and everything. Well, I AM on good terms with everyone, but people tend to gravitate towards top performing people, and he's admittedly one of the best, and hanging out with him indirectly means not hanging out with me. It's making it hard for me to join any groups since he's kinda in the center of everything. It's affecting me mentally since I'm always alone in work after-parties, formal events, etc. It's making it harder and harder for me to fit in since I feel the gaps growing bigger and my anxiety soaring. Not to mention, it's affecting my work. Can anyone give me some advice on how to deal with this? I would really appreciate it.",,,,,,,,
What should you do If your parents installed camera in your room..,"Hello, 16Y M, I am a high school student,
I recently found a camera installed in my room. 
When I asked my parents about it they didn't say anything. I usually clean my room throughly and obviously it was not there yesterday. 
I found it at morning. It was time for my parents to leave home And they said they'll talk about it later at dinner. What are the valid arguments I could make to get that thing out of my room. 
My parents personality is a bit religious(they are biased with old norms and believes in myths about masturbation). It could be considered that they somehow found that i masturbated a week ago. Normal thing would be to tell I didn't do it but they obv won't believe me.",,,,,,,,
Complex dating problem (college USA),"I met a girl about a month ago from college. I’ve introduced myself and we had a few really good conversations where she was engaging with me asking questions etc. I really liked her and was feeling good about everything. I’ve been waiting for a girl where things just feel right and I kinda felt that special feeling with her.

Anyway a few weeks later class starts and she happened to be in my class.  This time she was wearing a hijab (she’s never worn one before) I didn’t actually know she was Muslim so this was a surprise. I’m non Muslim so I was sort of thrown off by this. When I tried talking to her in class that day she seemed really removed from me almost like she couldn’t talk to me.

These last few weeks I’ve been looking up dating rules in Islam and basically she can’t talk to me as I’m not  Muslim. 

3 weeks have passed since this happened and I’ve backed off entirely. I haven’t tried to talk to her and I’ve taken a hint. (In the past 3 weeks she hasnt worn a hijab)

I really like this girl and I just want to get to know her.  Converting to Islam is something I’m open to but I need to talk to her a bit more.   I feel like if she knew I was open to converting and acknowledged her religion her opinion would be entirely different like it was when we first met.

Not sure what to do pls help",,,,,,,,

SPSL Wage Claim,"Hello everyone, 

Preface, I work in California. Back in June 2022 I was denied SPSL by my previous employer. I provided a positive test (antigen), and a nurse note (Kaiser stated they don’t issue doctor’s notes for positive covid tests). When I tried using my own sick time to cover the days I was out sick I was denied. Their claim was that I didn’t call the employer’s attendance phone number everyday I was sick and that I didn’t provide a doctor after the 5th day. 

I submitted a wage claim with DLSE more than half a year ago, and recently had my conference hearing with the DLSE and my previous employer. My employer agreed their wrongdoing and are willing to pay the amount withheld, and Labor Code Section 248.5 (b)(2) [An additional sum for SPSL for sick days calculated at three times the amount of sick days unlawfully withheld, not to exceed $4,000.]

However, my previous employer is not willing to pay Labor Code Section 248.5 (b)(3) [An additional sum for SPSL calculated at $50 per day for a violation resulting in other harm or violation of rights, not to exceed $4,000]. My previous employers representative stated that my rights weren’t violated and that’s why they don’t agree to paying that penalty.

So now I am asking various pages. Is there any advice on how to move forward? I had to utilize my credit cards to stay afloat back then as I was missing weeks worth of pay.",,,,,,,,

"Fear of abandonment, affecting my friendship with my best friend","Hey guys.. I'll say it to begin with. I do realise this is a me problem and I'm here for advice on how to overcome it.

Me and my best friend have spent probably an average of 6 hours+ a day, online, for the last few years. We used to give each other 100% and slowly over time, my friend would make more friends and spend time with them without me there. That's normal, everyone's allowed to spend time with who they want. But lately there's been this new person that my friend has been wanting to include in everything that we do, things we used to do just the two of us etc. And they even ruin their sleep schedule to be able to spend more time with this person, when they're already low on sleep. I have a fear of abandonment. Multiple times in my life, people I considered my best friends didn't find me interesting enough after spending a lot of time with me and slowly gravitated towards other people.. Just like now.. I fear that my friend will stop confiding in me because they're instead confiding in the other person and thy they'll gradually spend less time with me over time etc.. But this person means a lot to me and I really cherish the time I spend with them.. So I get fearful that they too may grow tired of me and eventually treat me as a.. Not so close friend or a close friend who they don't spend much time with anymore.. I don't know how to deal with these feelings or if I can even do anything to help my case here..

Any advice is appreciated",,,,,,,,
Work advice,"Hi guys. I am a law student at a small firm. Recently I got assigned more legal work as compared to administrative work. I was given a few tasks which I submitted on time.

"I don't get why people vehemently say the ""friend zone"" isn't real","Seems like a pretty simple concept to me, a person has romantic feelings for someone who does not feel the same, but still is interested in a friendship, as opposed to cutting contact all together or even antagonising them in some way

I've read that this implies men are entitled to a woman's affection if they treat them nicely, but I really don't see where this is coming from. 

Yeah some idiots will think they deserve it and won't accept a rejection, so they refer to ""friend zoning"" as a malicious act performed by women, who were tricking them (for their amusement?).

But that's never how I saw it, I always imagined the person who ""friend zoned"" the other as interested in having a genuine friendship. It happens, it sucks to be ""friend zoned"", but what can you do?

On valentines day, she contacted me and wanted to be friends, i said no. Because I can't handle seeing her happy with another guy. I know its sounds hypocrital.

"I keep getting pestered for having female friends, what do you call a casual friend that you have no romantic or sexual feelings for and only want to be strict friends with?","I, a guy have a moderate amount of female friends, however if someone were to ask if I was dating or liked one of them (Which I dont, strict friends) I wouldn't really know how to emphazize what sort of friendship I have with them.

I've heard of platonic friends however from my research, platonic friends are friends who you're very close with although have zero romantic or sexual feelings for. In other words they're strictly just very close friends.

&amp;#x200B;

However I dont know how to categorize it in this case, Im not extremely close with my female friends like what ""Platonic friendship"" is talking about

  
Correct me if im wrong.

For context if anyone is wondering, I was somewhat sort of in a way asked this indirectly as one of my fellow students sort of said in front of my friend group that I sat beside a girl and might have a crush on that girl  (One of my female friends)

I told him the crush part was not true and managed to steer the conversation from this little discussion sort of fast. No mention of that conversation or my friendshis have come to be.

This weekend I am going to hang out with the same female friend aswell as a mutual female friend (We both already know her) and this matter came back into my head that someone might ask me again. Honestly I feel annoyed that you cant hang out with friends from the opposite sex without people thinking one of them likes the other or that there is always some romantic tension between the two friends of opposite sexes.",,,,,,,,
Not sure I did the right thing after argument with friend,"My friend is like a sister to me and we have been in each other’s lives for years. Unfortunately, she has been spiraling over the last year and it’s been difficult to know how to help. It’s been extremely emotionally taxing as there is a new crisis every other day. She recently found out she is pregnant and it’s at a pretty bad time in her life. She was upset with how I responded, which was to say that I am sad for her and also upset at her since this pregnancy seemed to be intentional (won’t get into why but she hasn’t denied this) and knowingly bringing a baby into a bad situation seems unfair. I know lots of single parents in bad circumstances raise great kids. But due to my own situation, growing up with a mom with mental health issues, it’s really hard for me to be excited for her and supportive when she cannot provide for a baby financially, emotionally, or otherwise. It’s probably worth mentioning that I’m a new mom as well. She said it’s best we don’t talk (in a passive aggressive way), and I’m honoring that. I left our group chats, I unfriended and blocked her on social, and am generally just planning to leave it alone. 

There were a lot of other reasons this friendship wasn’t healthy and it has been pretty one sided as of late. This friend doesn’t seem to care what’s going on with others (doesn’t even ask) and in general her problems take center stage. I know my response was emotional and less than perfect, but I don’t know what else I could have done. Is it best to just move forward with no contact?

Parents invidate my feelings?,"I’m 23 and can’t take living with my parents any longer. They love me, but they are very emotionally immature. My entire life I grew up with severe anxiety. For an example, I had anxiety attacks almost every morning about school. I was never told anything comforting about any of this, they would always just make it all about them and how hard it is for them for me to deal with these things. I was told several times by my mom as a child that I would “drive her to drink” because I was so “difficult” due to my anxiety. When i went to therapy as a child for it, they would tell me “we don’t wanna have to be doing this.”

 Fast forward to my adulthood, everytime I try to express my feelings to them about anything they may have said or done that hurt my feelings, i’m automatically invalidated. One of times included me bringing up the “driving her to drink” thing. Other times, it’s me trying to express that I don’t feel comfortable with my mom telling other family members my personal business. My mom says sorry but she’s also says things like “it’s not a big deal” “you’re overreacting” “that never happened, i don’t do those things” “i can’t do this anymore” “i thought nothing of it” “sorry i’m such a horrible mother”.  I don’t know what to do anymore. Anything I say or do I feel like will never be taken seriously and i’ll just be viewed as being problematic/making a big deal out of nothing.

 Again, they do show me love in all other ways, they do a lot for me, and they are good parents outside of this.  BUT when it comes to emotions and feelings I am never EVER validated, no matter how hard I try. I know if I were to explain feeling invalidated, that would be invalidated too. I feel like because I had so much anxiety as a child, and because of that making me seem “difficult”, I will forever be viewed as difficult to them. Please help.

How do I Talk to my Husband About this Without Worrying Him?,"Please know that while this involves a medical event, I am not asking for medical or legal advice. I am looking for advice on how to talk to my husband about how I’m feeling and if I can do so without making him feel bad or guilty.

My husband recently had surgery to repair his knee after tearing his ACL and MCL. It was a routine surgery and we were told things went well. 

Prior to surgery, he took a COVID test and checked his temperature (as he was told). My husband’s baseline temperature is normally in the 96’s. Before surgery it was 99.1, which for *him* is a low-grade fever. We tried to explain this to the surgeons but they insisted he was not feverish and had no other symptoms.

After getting home to recover he became very sick. Fever, uncontrollable shaking, back pain. We went back to the hospital and they put him on oxygen and IV fluids/antibiotics.

He is recovering. He’s been back home for a week and is feeling better each day. The experience didn’t seem to scare him too much. I, however, have been a wreck. I’ve never seen my husband sick before. Maybe an occasional cold, which for him are like sniffles. I’m crying every day when I think about how terrible he felt and how much pain he was in. I’m also scared to leave him alone when I go to work each day because of how fast it happened. The day it happened, he went to sleep for a nap and woke up with full-blown symptoms. 

I feel guilty because I feel like I’m turning myself into a victim when he’s the one who went through it. He’s very encouraging and understanding but I haven’t felt ready to tell him how much I’m still struggling emotionally because I don’t want him to feel bad or distressed. 😔",,,,,,,,
Would it be weird to start telling people that I have memory issues?,"I'm curious how people would react to someone just dropping in that they struggle to remember people?

I'm a really social person and I often have people remember me super well, greet me excitedly and then look super crestfallen when I don't remember them. 

It's usually people I don't see often or don't come up in conversation much. For example, I've been going to the same music festival for 10 years and there's people I've camped with every single year, hang out with, have conversations with, but always completely forget. It's as though every year I'm meeting a completely new set of people who just seem vaguely familiar.

At best it's really embarrassing, and at worst it makes me feel incredibly guilty to make people feel forgettable. I struggle to even remember good friends at the best of times.

I explain I have memory issues when people seem upset by it, but try to put a positive jokey spin on it by saying things like ""but it's nice to meet you even if it's for the 100th time!"" and ""the great thing is that you can tell me a story I've heard before and keep my interest""

I was thinking if I do meet people and we get along, to just say ""by the way, I have memory issues so if I don't remember you next time we meet please don't take it personally""

But I don't wanna come across as, y'know one of those people who just talk about their health issues like they're a personality trait? I don't wanna talk about it or get pitied for it, I just wanna drop a disclaimer so I don't make people feel shitty.

I know most people will say that they'd be fine with it, but genuinely, if someone just said that to you wouldn't you assume they're a bit of a drama llama?",,,,,,,,
"14F, should I tell social services about my father?","Hey so I'm in kind of a situation at the moment where I'm unable to manage school / regular life due to a lot of anxiety and memories of my family's past treatment of me.

I don't remember a lot of it but from what I do, I've been yelled at, had my arms twisted, been hit, had things thrown at me, been threatened, so on so forth.

It used to be a lot worse when I was younger but back then I had no access to help. I do now but since my parents are now extremely kind to me I don't want to ruin this.

Should I tell social services of this or is it too minor? Multiple therapists already know but they never took any action about it. For additional context I am asian so more serious punishments are the norm but I was never that much of a bad kid I think.",,,,,,,,

How can I help my pregnant sister if she doesn't ask,"So my sister (32F) is expecting with her fiance (21M). They have been together a year and are already engaged and have a baby due in July. He is very immature and I don't think he understands how life changing having a baby will be. I honestly think my sister just wanted to have a baby and didn't care who the father was ( her last 2 relationships ended because she pressured them into having a baby and they both said no) whenever I ask how things are going she says great. There was one time when she said she felt ""aggressively lonely"" after I asked her what she meant she ignored me and the next day pretended like she never said that. Now I am getting messages from her friends that they are concerned for her and she keeps having "" mental breakdowns"" that her partner is never around, he keeps going out with his friends and says it's because he knows when baby comes "" he'll be stuck in the house with them"". My sister is totally financially reliant on her boyfriend he owns the house they live in, she didn't work for months before getting pregnant and only just started a minimum wage job. I just don't know how to help her especially because I only know she's struggling because of her friends... I don't want to throw them under the bus leaving her angry with her only support system ( both of our parents are deceased and I live 10 hours away) I'm really worried about her and I don't think she is ready for a baby it all feels very rushed. I don't want her to feel judged or anything I'm just really lost how I can help her. It's causing me so much stress I just think she needs help or something I don't even know !",,,,,,,,

Friend was made uncomfortable,"So. 

I got a text from someone I used to be friends (let's call him Jack) with asking why I and another friend have been ghosting him. My friend (let's call her Lucy), him and another friend (let's call her Beth) had somewhat of a small group, we went out a couple of times, we were all working at the same place and that's how we met. 

At some point, Jack made Lucy feel uncomfortable, I'm not too sure on the details of it but she has told me that she was really unsettled by it and was uncomfortable to be around him. Beth was leaving to go travelling with her boyfriend and before they left that had a party at his house, he was a few hours drive away so the four of us went up for the weekend, even though Lucy felt uneasy about it. Beth knew about it but for whatever reason didn't really want to hear about it and we went up. 

We had quite a nice time anyway and as far as I know, nothing was said or done about it. This party was back in November/December I think. Beth left to go travelling soon after, in December and Lucy and I just kinda moved on, she's still really close to Beth and she and I are planning to visit her at some point in the summer.

Last week, he sent us both a message asking each of us how we were and both of us just left it. Yesterday he sent me a message (I don't think he text Lucy) again, this time saying long time no speak. Then today, he messaged again asking why I and Lucy have ghosted him since Beth moved away. 

I really don't know what to do because I feel guilty about ignoring the guy, I know it's horrible to be ghosted and especially not knowing why. It makes me feel like an awful person. In my head, I was looking out for Lucy, she's a closer friend than he was and she was made uncomfortable and as far as I'm concerned I don't want to be friends with someone that would do that. 

I spoke to one of my other friends today about it and she told me that yeah it's not nice to ghost someone and I should reply, even though you had a reason for it, he might not realise what he's done and I should tell him the reason why. I feel sick about it and don't know what to do/say to him.

I really appreciate your advice!!!",,,,,,,,
How to stop wake-and-baking weed?,"I smoke weed all day, whats the best way to stop when super addicted to the act of smoking plus getting high?",,,,,,,,
Financial stability and emotional intimacy,"My wife and I have been married for 11+ years. We were both raised in a very religious community with very strong ideas about marriage and divorce. We married very young, as is the custom (early 20's). We both exited the religion some 8 years ago, and recently (2 years) moved to a state far from our religious families. It has been very freeing. We have two young children. 

When we got married we had nothing. We had zero dollars in our bank account. We have worked extremely hard to improve our economic situation and have done so without either of our family’s help. We know what it is to not have enough money to fill a car's gas tank all the way up and to rely on government assistance. 

I'm now very fortunate to earn more money than I had ever let myself imagine possible, and on top of that my salary has effectively tripled in the past 2 years. Money is no longer a real concern. My wife is a stay-at-home mom and we have created a small business for her that is more of a hobby than a money making endeavor. It’s something that she loves doing and is good at, but it would not be a way to sustain anything close to the lifestyle that we have now.

As the financial stress has slowly been stripped away, I'm finding that there are other concerns now coming to the forefront. My wife and I have created a beautiful life, but I don't feel like either of our emotional needs are being met. There is no abuse, or anger, or violence in our home, unlike the homes we both grew up in. We’ve worked hard to cultivate a gentle home environment. We absolutely adore our children. Our kids are the most amazing little creatures on the planet and we both love them more than everything else in the world combined. We have a beautiful house and nice cars. We have plenty of money and resources. Last year we took three international vacations and several family trips stateside for God’s sake. We have worked insanely hard and have been and continue to be ridiculously fortunate. I am unspeakably grateful to the people who have helped and mentors us through very challenging situations. 

We lack nothing, but if I look sat it honestly, I’m unhappy with our relationship. I don’t feel satisfied or fulfilled. I don’t feel heard or appreciated. I feel that I’m the one who fixes problem and finds solutions and ends disagreements through brokering a compromise. I don’t know how to fix it, or even if I want to ‘fix’ it. I know that I do not want to go back to the status quo. 

This all sunk in and I entered a strong depression around 6 months ago. I've recently been able to come out of it somewhat through a combination of medicine and therapy (my wife also takes medication for depression/anxiety and has done so for years, and she also attends weekly therapy sessions). My wife and I began couples therapy as I entered the depression and we decided to put it on hold until I could get my own mental health to a stable place. I'm now at that place, but we haven’t started couples therapy again yet. I’m not sure that I want to unless and until I feel like we have done the groundwork that it requires. I’m not sure if I want to do the groundwork.

Divorce would be exceptionally challenging. I’m also willing to sacrifice my happiness for the good of our children. I’m not convinced that staying together is the best solution or example, but I can imagine the trauma that a divorce would cause on these little people that we care about so much and dedicate our lives to. Splitting up our assets and completely rearranging our lives would be no easy task, either.

I'm hoping to solicit advice on the following: I’m concerned that my wife is dedicated to continuing our marriage not because it’s fulfilling her emotional needs, but because she is scared of losing the financial stability that we have created. I know that she isn’t satisfied with the level of emotional intimacy. Neither am I. As I look back honestly on our marriage… I do t think I ever have been. I’ve been single-mindedly concerned with creating the life for my family that I’ve always envisioned. I feel worry that she will never let go, or even seriously consider letting go of, our financial stability even if it would be better for both of us and our children. 

I won’t move forward on a divorce unless my wife and I both agree that it is the best thing for us and our children. I would never leave her in a tough financial situation, not least because she is the mother of my children and I love her. That love and work ethic has kept us together for years, but I feel like I’m finally coming up for air and realizing that I would really like to be happier and feel appreciated instead of tolerated. 

Any advice is welcome. I will post this on different subreddits to get the most insight possible. Please forgive any typos as I’m using a phone to write and the length has gotten slightly out of control. Thanks for reading.",,,,,,,,
Did i rape my ex girlfriend?,"I, 18 male have been in a relationship with my girlfriend 19 female for 2 months before breaking up because of my mental health and instability ( i have APSPD and BPD), we stopped talking for about a year, and then she came back to wish happy birthday, we started talking again, and 2 weeks later we decided to meet up to catch up. There was nothing sexual at first, it was just a hangout between friends, but we ended making out on the sidewalk, at that point everything was fine, i was trying to be a better person overall, since i was very toxic before, and i caused her a great deal of pain, and i caused myself a great deal of pain as well, it was very hard for me to cope with my traumas and my lack of emotion and empathy as well as my lack of understanding of social clues. For about 3 weeks, we were seeing each other on and off, i used to come see her almost every day, and we were happy. One day decide to come over to see her as usual, we start making out and then we decide to try anal, as i was putting on the condom, i was very stressed as i have never tried anal before ( i wanted to have vaginal sex but she didn’t want to so i gave it up), she was on top of me and i tried to put my dick inside her asshole, but i accidentally put it in the wrong hole; I was shocked and we stopped for a few minutes, i tried to lighten up the mood by cracking a few jokes, and then we continued as usual. We stopped talking for a few days, but one night i called her as i was drunk, and i apologized over and over again, because i could not forgive myself for doing something like that as i am a victim of rape myself, she then told me that she forgave me and to forgive myself,  we stopped talking again for a little while and we just started talking again, while we were on call she said it was technically rape laughing since she didn’t consent to it but i didn’t do it on purpose, so we had a conversation about it and we both don’t know if its rape or not. We both agreed to post this so we could get some insight about it. So, did i rape my ex girlfriend?",,,,,,,,
"he slept over at a girls house, red flag?","i’ve been talking to this guy for a month now. we’ve been hanging out a good bit and we’ve both expressed that we have feelings for one another. our college is currently on spring break and he’s home with his friends.

him and his female friend took some edibles and he spent the night at her house. when he was snapping me, he was in bed with her but he was sending me photos and it made it clear that they were separated. his body was above the blanket and her body was under and there was a pretty big space between them in the bed. this morning he snapped me and he was still there.

What would you do?,"So, last year I lost a really good job with a decent pay &amp; pretty nice benefits &amp; ever since I’ve been struggling to make ends meet. Eventually, I had to move back in with my mother. I’ve been trying to help my mom out as she suffers with schizophrenia &amp; bipolar for the past couple months. Things have been pretty fking rough, especially when we found out she was using drugs just recently. 

During all of these events, I’ve been considering moving back in with my father. He told me I’d have a job to start almost immediately when I got out there, I’ve been obsessing over this idea. The downside being, I’d be making borderline minimum wage and only working part time. Whatever, fk it… I’m gonna go. 

Then, my mom then admitted herself as an addict suffering with mental health issues. It’s been roughly three weeks &amp; she sounds like she’s doing phenomenal. She’s taking the steps to better herself and going back to therapy. She left for the first time in 20 years, two months ago. 

Unfortunately, I had to be offered another position here making double what I’m making at the moment. It’s right up the road from me so transportation isn’t an issue. It’s only 4 days a week working 10 hours a day, giving me an extra 3 days to work on my personal interest in hope of making it out of poverty. 

Based on all of these events, I don’t really know if moving is a good idea or not. On one hand, I can stay &amp; make double what I’m making currently. On the other, I can move in with very my dad &amp; have no family or friends around me making the same amount that I’m making at the moment. What would you do?",,,,,,,,
I want to confront my mom about the SA she did to me.,"CW, TW: sexual assault (not too graphic or bad but still)

(Sorry for bad formatting- mobile 🥲👍🏼)

I’ve been debating confronting my mom for a while. I don’t remember much of my childhood due to trauma from her first husband; he abused me, my sister and my mom for years. Because of the abuse I’m not sure if my mom remembers what she did to me when I was 13. I didn’t remember until recently when I recalled it. 

My biological dad had left us by walking out. So I guess my mom was extra defensive about keeping me safe and “protecting“ me, she found a note that I was passing among peers when I was in middle school. I was trying to get along with the popular girls, and said things about doing certain things with cute boys (I don’t even really remember what the note exactly said). I just wanted to try to make friends since I had been bullied all throughout elementary school. I guess my mom rummaged through my backpack and found this and read it, got upset and then confronted me, but ended up assaulting me. She ended up bursting into my room, while I was doing homework shoved me down on the bed while yelling at me about how I agreed that I wanted to join in and do certain things or have certain things done to me. Then she roughly grabbed my shirt and shoved me down and rubbed herself against me very hard while yelling at me. I guess she wanted to scare me to show me how certain bad people could be in the world? I know she was trying to protect me, but now I just want to talk to her about it see if she remembers and I guess I hope for an apology?

I don’t know what to do, but it just keeps popping up into my head and I can’t stop thinking about it and I don’t feel very comfortable being around her sometimes now because of it.",,,,,,,,
My son wants to go no contact over me pushing him to go to an Ivy League school," My son (18m) graduated high school in 2022 with honors within the top 5% of his class. He has always been very academically gifted, so naturally when it was time to pick out a college his junior/senior year, we were aiming high. My son expressed that he really did not feel comfortable going away yet and wanted to take a year and go to community college first to ease the transition. My husband (my kid’s step-father) and I both figured he was just nervous, and when he got into an ivy league school, we pushed him very hard to go. My husband specifically told him that it would mean a lot (my kid is a first gen college student) for us to be able to say we have a kid that goes to this school. 

So, in August we practically dragged him to school and helped him move in. He was angry and upset, but we thought we were doing the right thing. He has a major anxious temperament, but we figured he would get used to it and mellow out a little bit. He went to his biological dad’s house for Christmas and Thanksgiving, which was a major surprise since my son has been living with me for several years. I have not seen him in quite a while and haven’t really been hearing from him. I thought it would be nice to visit him, and so last week I arranged it with him. When I got up there, he looked terrible. He had lost weight, had visible dark circles under his eyes, and just looked miserable. He had nothing put up on the walls in his dorm, and his side of the room looked so bleak and sad compared to his roommate’s. I began to realize that I made a massive mistake forcing him to move out. 

I asked him how he was and he said he did not enjoy being there. He also said that he would not be returning next year and will be living with his bio dad  from now on. I know I did wrong, but I cannot believe he would prefer to live with his father, who he barely knows. He says that my husband and I didn’t respect his ability to make decisions for himself and that he doesn’t want to see us for the time being. I am shocked and unsure of how to save my relationship with him.",,,,,,,,

Needing some advice on how to cope with something,"
Ok so I’m autistic and with someone who has ADHD and they want some time alone to think about things. 
He’s also still grieving at the moment and I also am, I’m more into comfort and things and he’s more into staying alone and things to cope which he’s looking for some months to calm down a bit.
I myself am struggling with it since I’m not used to being alone and have few phobias where I don’t like being alone.
Since recently I also had brain surgery and he’s been sending congrats since it went successful but he doesn’t seem to be giving that comfort or attention.
I also struggle with needing someone to talk and vent to cause I’ve had many traumatic experiences in my life and he’s one of the people who I trust and mostly vent to , meaning I’ve had to expand my horizons to find someone to vent to (isn’t going well)
When I talked to him one time he also came across as quite rude and things towards me I don’t clearly know what’s wrong with him cause he won’t open up , communication is something he really struggles with but I really need him to open up about the reasons why he’s like this. 
His grief is from afew years ago and I know it can follow you for a long time , but I think there’s more behind it.
He did say he has gained more physical and mental problems but he’s refusing to go the hospital and I keep overthinking and feel a big need to text him or do something. I can’t just sit back.

My girlfriend (23F) is asking me (23M) to unfollow girls I know on Instagram.,"So My Girlfriend Of Almost 1.5 Years Has Very Bad Anxiety, And I Do All That I Can To Ease Her Worries, Reassure Her I Love Her, And Help Her Out.

I've Never Had Anything Romantic With Them And I Have No Intentions On Hitting Them Up/Cheating On My Girlfriend.). This Was Recurring Topic For A While That Died Down For A Very Long Time, But Just Came Up Again. I Told Her I Never Talk To These Girls Online Really, And I Never Check Their Pages, Their Feeds, Etc And Thats Theres Nothing To Worry About. I'm Hardly Even Much Of A Media Person Outside Of Youtube. I Know She Has Problems With Guys Following Models, But I Don't Do That. So I Said That I Don't Want Her To Be Controlling Towards Me Because I'm Never That Way With Her, And I'm Not Okay With Her If She Gives Me This Ultimatum When I've Done So Much For Her To Try To Ease Her Anxiety And Prove To Her That I Love Her. (Btw She Is Posted On My Instagram So Other Girls Would Know I Have A Girlfriend Anyway)

She Says That Me Being Reluctant To Unfollow Them Shows I Value Them More Than I Value My Relationship With Her And That Me Following Other Girls Gives Her The Ick. But For Me, Its Not About Her Telling Me To Unfollow Specific People -- For Me Its About Upholding My Standards And Not Letting Other People Tell Me How To Manage My Social Media, Etc. I Have No Problem Unfollowing These People, But I Think It Points To Larger Red Flags If She Feels This Way Simply About Me Following These Girls I Don't Interact With At All.

Am I In The Wrong For Not Unfollowing These Girls I Don't Interact With On Insta Because My Girlfriend Wants Me To? Should I Just Leave?",,,,,,,,

I want to go back to school.,"I graduated with a bachelor's in accounting May 2022. I am turning 24.

My parents would not listen to me about accounting. They are very ignorant. 

Accounting is a terrible career choice for many reasons. 
- CPA exam. Extremely challenging with a lot of loops to jump through. 1.5 years minimum study time. Some people fail and take the exam 10-20 times.
- Have to get a Master's in Accounting to get CPA licensed. Which I don't really want to do.
- I suck at accounting. I hate the subject. 
- Busy season every single year. Guaranteed to be working 50-60 hours Jan-April.

I hate accounting. I hate it so much. It is the only thing in my life I want to change.

I want to study statistics.
- It provides more work life balance, 
- only need a Master's to open career doors (no ridiculous licensing exams)
- i actually enjoy and am good at the subject.

"I don't know if I want to play video games, have a family, or both","I'm male, 35 years old. I've been living with my girlfriend of 1.5 years for a few months and everything is going well between us.

I also love to play video games but haven't played intensely in years. Maybe once a year I take 3-4 days to play a game with a friend nonstop, but apart from that it's just a few hours per month. 

The issue is that I think about playing games *a lot*. I daydream about spending days playing games online with friends. It's tugging at me constantly. But I also know that this isn't compatible with being in a relationship, and possibly having children (which is on the table). I'm also afraid of my girlfriend's judgment even if I played a little bit more. She's not a gamer at all and is not interested. 

I feel like I'm wasting my life, somehow just following the rules but not really doing what I enjoy. There's something about immersing yourself in a game, especially with a friend online, being in it nonstop, waking up just to start up the game again, that is all... so intense, it makes me feel super awake and in the moment.

So sometimes I think I should leave my girlfriend, live by myself, and just play games. But I also know that I can quickly get to a point where *playing games feels like wasting time* too. And I wonder wait, what will I think in 10 years ? In 30 years ? Will I regret doing this? Will I feel like I've wasted my time building nothing?

Maybe the healthy thing would be to play a little more and not worry about my girlfriend's opinion. But I'm afraid it would only make me want to play more. I really feel like I have this impossible relationship with games.",,,,,,,,
Everything is boring,"I play a lot of video games and it lets me connect with online friends, but I no longer experience joy from gaming. So tried other stuff, but it all got boring after a while, I asked people at school what they did all day and they said they would walk to their friends house and hangout.
 But I live in a very small neighbourhood so there is no one to visit nearby. When I go outside there is nobody there. My mom is allergic to everything so we can’t get a pet. I can’t enjoy nature because it’s winter and all around our house is farm fields. I feel stuck.",,,,,,,,
My doorman made up a fake story to solicit GoFundMe donations from residents and now won’t talk to me because I refused to donate. What should I do?,"Hey guys. This is kind of a wild story. 

I live in an apartment building lucky enough to have a doorman/concierge. 

The residents have a Facebook group that he’s in. Last week, he posted a GoFundMe link saying he had gotten into not 1, but 2 (!) car accidents and he needed help to pay for car and medical bills for him and his girlfriend. 

Keep in mind that he has also told me before that he’s a recovered addict. 

People start donating, and then he shows up at work the next day totally fine. Every time I walked in and out of the building though, I saw him basking in the attention of some passerby who he had pulled to the side to tell the story to and it just seemed awkward when the person was put on the spot to be apologetic and donate.

So me being the type of person that I am, I pulled all car accident reports that are in the county and neighboring counties. 

I find only one with his name as a party to it within the past 2 weeks. I start getting suspicious. Upon clicking the report, I see it detailed no injuries to anyone. 

Anyways, I don’t mention this at all but he seems to be keeping tabs on who donated and who didn’t (no donation was anonymous) and now every time I walk by he turns his head and won’t say hello. A big change from before where he always greeted me. 

I can’t even talk to him or pick up my packages anymore when he’s working his shift (which is 9-5 every day). What should I do?",,,,,,,,
"Should I just accept a reduced incentive raise, or push back on management?","Background:

My company lost a very good employee last year, to another opportunity with higher comp.  My company's response to the remainder of the team was launching an incentive plan to bring up comp and be more competitive.  However, because of the metrics the incentive would be measured against, it could not start being paid out until early 2023.  Projections for the incentive were calculated and communicated in mid-2022, and was scheduled to be paid out over 6 months.  After 6 months, metrics would be recalculated, and the payout adjusted for the following 6 months, and so on.

Issue:

Earlier this week, the first paycheck that included incentive was processed, for half the expected/communicated amount for the entire team.  With no communication coming down from leadership (our direct supervisor is out of town), multiple team members reached out to payroll, to be given the news that rather than being paid out over 6 months, it is being paid out over 12 months.  This effectively cut the current payout by 50%.  Metrics for the next payout will be calculated midway through 2023, and that payout will be spread over 12 months, stacking on top of the current payout.  That will bring the payout more in line with the estimates and expectations set in mid-2022, but not until August of this year.

Now, I know my explanation may be a little convoluted, but the rub is this.  For the next 6 months, the expected increase is half of what was promised, and the team has to wait another 6 months before we receive the full amount.  

Should I just be happy that I received a raise now, and can expect another raise 6 months from now.  Or should I push back on management and point out the fact that the payout was changed with no communication or consideration for the team, and that team morale (after receiving raises) is very low?",,,,,,,,

Should I finance jaw treatmenr before or after my 3 months travels?,"I really need to finance a jaw treatment because my teeth are all slanted and it is difficult to chew.

I got a quote for this which expires in a month.

I was wondering if I should get this before or after my 3 months stay in another country because it will add 200ish dollars expenses to my life.

I plan to go 3 months after quitting my job to another country. This us not debatable as this is my dream to do and the reason why I work in the first place. I save up and then take a few months to explore the world.

My only concern would be that added expense 200 per month if I get it beforehand, and there is no guarantee that I will be able to find a job or the money to continue paying that after I return in November.

But this issue with my jaw is pressing and having this treatment now (only takes 6 weeks) will really just get this out of the way for me and might even make it more enjoyable to travel.

Advice for a teen,"Hi, I've just recently turned 16 and shit has been quite rough lately. I'm studying for a competitive exam, and this is my first time exposure to the actual real world, i have some symptoms of clinical depression like lethargy, lack of concentration, low energy, no motivation, it's like my happiness has been stripped away from me. I live in India. I'll just get straight to my questions

1.) I often wonder , do most people really hate their jobs , sometimes when I'm studying it really feels like a chore, it feels you're bounded by chains and there's always something like an exam lurking around the corner. Is the life of most adults like this? Constant stress? Pressure ? Continuous workload? No time off? No one to rely on? No one you can vent out to? Is it you just holding up the entire weight of the world? If you succeed, others get jealous and hate you behind your back, and if you don't they call you a failure? Expectations of the people you love? Do most adults do things they don't like? All the time? For years? How do they manage? These days I feel so nihilistic and empty and just fucking broken from inside? Like you're forced to do things you don't do, for hours , for days , for months , for years. It's really taking a toll on my soul. I used to be a happy kid.

2.) Do you often feel left behind. Like you're unable to catch up , like you're losing a race, like you're behind the competition, everyone is moving forward, the people who you once thought you were somewhat better than at work start to catch up? And you're slowly being left behind in the dust for good. What do you do in this situation, like I'm really troubled by this. There are all these guys who are super smart teens who get good grades, then there are these tall athletes who get all the attention and girls, and then there's me, i try my best and work hard but I just can't, i just can't push past, these guys always leave me behind , in everything. I've tried being consistent , I've tried the good old "" go to the gym wake up at 5am advice"" but fuck man when I compare these guys to me I feel so inferior and ashamed of myself from the huge gap between me and those guys. 
It's very primal. It's almost like you can see a smirk on these guys faces when they know they can beat you. When they know they have an edge over you and you just feel frustrated and you can't really do much. IT PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH. I just want to be good at something. Please help",,,,,,,,

Trigger warning maybe SA,"A while back, I got black out drunk and left with a guy I’d just met. I don’t even remember leaving the event. When I woke up I was completely sore and swollen down there. This has never happened to me before. I was so confused and uncomfortable. 

I know I intentionally left with this guy, but I still feel a little uneasy about the situation. Not that I would report anything because I have no idea what even happened, but I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to wrap my mind around it all. Was it just my stupidity that left me with regret? Can I be angry at him for kind of using my body while I was wasted?

How do I stop regretting all of my life choices?,"I obsess over my past life choices with regret. Primarily I regret not going to a different college.

I did fine but way below what I could have done in school, I went to good to great schools, but I could have gone to better or at least more interesting schools. I learned so much less than I should have. I coasted on good looks, charm, and innate smarts. I regret the people I chose as my regular girlfriends, I regret marrying one of them...beyond regret. 

Basically 4-6 times a year I look up colleges and at things online and sadly yearn for a different life that I didn't choose.",,,,,,,,
fiancé (35m) has recently been telling me (25f) that I don’t add value to his life and I take up space,"Too keep a long story short. We have been together for 2 and a half years.

Loner with toxic and racist friends,"
Highschool for me has been absolutely miserable. I am a Junior currently and although I have like 4 friends 2 of them just are so hard to deal with. One of them is a guy called Brody and I genuinely feel like he is a racist. He is constantly saying racist shit towards me since my skin color is brown. Whenever he like sees brown he is like “Look that’s you” and laugh and I just say “Shut up” he constantly keeps saying that and he even calls me a monkey sometimes. I thought it was very surprising and kinda funny at first but it got annoying really quickly to the point where it’s just annoys me and I can’t do anything about it. I am very short and also skinny so this school just doesn’t take me seriously and is constantly just playing around with me. I have this other friend called Isabel and she is just rude towards me and makes jokes about my nose which is a little bigger then average and says the most hurtful things to me but I just laugh along even tho it’s not even that funny. The thing is I am a loner. I don’t have many friends in school and the ones that do have feel like a nightmare to deal with. I can’t just quit being friends with them cause I find it really hard to be friends with people due to social anxiety and just being a introvert. I don’t wanna be lonely I hate being lonely in lunch or when I need a partner for class. Idk what to do highschool has been so miserable to deal with every single day",,,,,,,,

I told my bully his address,"Throwaway account.


Context: This kid is bullying me for about 3 weeks now, and today I had enough of it. He tried to put glue in my bag, pushes and kicks me, mocks and makes fun of my accent etc (I have an American accent) I told my friends and one of them searched his name up on Google and found his Facebook page etc. I wanted to spook him off so maybe he could stop bullying me. I don't like fighting and I never start a fight, until they swing the first punch etc.

After I told him his address, his reaction was priceless.
Everyone thought I could get their address and I'm pretty sure nobody in my class likes me anymore.

Lunch time rolls around and he can't even start fighting without his friends pushing him into me etc, and he starts yanking my hair which doesn't hurt, hits me with flat hands,  still doesn't hurt until his friend told him to punch with a fist... it felt like tickles for me.

How can I style my hijab and outfit for a formal event (wedding or dinner party)?,"As many Muslim women living in the West know, wearing """"modest traditional"""" fashion when with family is a must, even if we dress however we like on any other day. So, I don't have much experience with dressing for formal events such as weddings or dinner parties with (distant) relatives and old family friends. As I was recently invited to such an event, I realized I don't really own a lot of """"appropriate"""" attire and don't really know how to style my hijab and outfit to look stylish but modest. 

&amp;#x200B;

While the internet helped me come up with a few ideas that might help other Muslim women who are in a similar situation, I'm hoping to hear from women on this sub, especially Muslim.

&amp;#x200B;

One idea I liked is a long, flowing maxi dress in a luxurious fabric such as silk or chiffon, paired with a coordinating hijab in a complementary color (and adding some sparkly accessories). Another is to wear a formal suit or dress pants with a blazer and blouse, again in luxurious fabrics such as silk or satin. A turban-style hijab (or even a simple hijab) with a fancy brooch should also add some elegance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also found inspiration from other Muslim women online who share their outfit ideas and styling tips. Many Muslim fashion bloggers and influencers have Instagram pages or YouTube channels where they share their latest looks and outfit ideas, and I'm increasingly falling in love with the designs from Abaya.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, are there specific online retailers that cater to Muslim fashion you girls use more than others? And how do they balance fashion and modesty when selecting their outfits?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I would love to hear other Muslim women's experiences with dressing for formal events. I would really love to feel """"stylish"""" while also honoring my family's cultural traditions. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",,,,,,,,
How should you respond to a pessimistic parent?,"I recently started living with my parents after ending my engagement. I’ve found my step mom has frequently affected my mood by being extremely pessimistic. 

She frequently complains about her job and brings up a lot of distrust in others actions as if they do it on purpose to have her suffer. When in all reality it’s more that I’m certain they don’t. She shows it towards her parents and sister. Even my brother and his fiancé. It seems like there’s something to be said about anyone in her life on the daily. 

Yesterday I went out to visit my brother and his fiancé because they left a jacket. I borrowed it on the way to my parents from the airport and while they visited they just forgot to take it with them. When I left she was saying, of course they didn’t want to drive over here or  why did I have to drive to them? They are 40 minutes away but I’m used to driving a lot. I just shrugged as her complaints have started to become draining to respond to. 

I had a good night with my brother and his fiancé and returned later at night. 

This morning she asked how it was and I told her I had a good time not really wanting a huge interaction since the topics she goes into with conversations seem more negative than positive. She asked what we ate, as my brother and his fiancé tend to make unique dishes that she tries to pick apart at times. I explained to her we had gone out to a tea place and then a board game cafe I’ve been wanting to show them for a while since I had a feeling they would like those places. I also said that they offered to introduce me to their friends at some point as I don’t know too many people within the area. She responded, ‘oh so they don’t have to be the ones driving?’ I told her I don’t think they meant it like that or even was a thought in their mind, especially I’m certain their friends are closer to where they are than I am. The conversation just seemed a bit awkward after that. 

This type of interaction is typical. To add background I recently started living with my parents and haven’t lived with them in over 5 years. I’m usually a bubbly person but with the lack of friends in the new area ,I’ve been spending a lot of time with my parents. I’ve found my mood being affected by this and I feel like I’m starting to become paranoid with the influence from these interactions. Sometimes it feels like I’m trapped in these conversations with her even when she knows I have to do something or be working. She tends to come into my room and have a conversation with me while I’m working even if I’ve let her know before that I’m working and can’t talk.

Any suggestions with how to cope or with responding to this?",,,,,,,,

What should I do with my love life,"I am currently with my boyfriend of 2 years, and I am starting to lose love, desire and interest about him.
Why so? Because He is doing NOTHING for our love life, neither for our life, he don't know how to affirm himself and I have to tell him everything, he never does anything by himself.

He got injured last year and had 2 verterbres (bones of the spine, sorry for my bad english) cracked and now he cannot hold anything heavy. I am the only one who've been here for him all time, who helped him and always reassured him but now I am getting at my limit, all he talks about all day is his health, there's always a part of his body that hurts, AND that boy is at home all day 24h/24h, no school, no job.

I have lost all sexual desire about him, even all urge to talk to him at all. I've tried everything to fix this, on my own side but he does absolutely nothing so I started to dislike interacting with him.
I am only 17 and I wanted to do my life with him but I feel like I am wasting my time and years of my life.

Should I tell my friend how much what she said hurt me?,"Hi, reddit. So my friend and I got into an argument about her boyfriend. I made a different post about that already.  While we were arguing, she threw some things that I said in the past back at me, like how I was bullied. 

The thing is that I had told her these things in confidence, thinking I could trust her. She said things to me that she knows my bullies used to say.

I didn’t say some of the stuff that she said to me because I felt like that was crossing a boundary. 

After we made up, I apologised about what I said about her boyfriend. But I never got an apology about what she said to me. 

Still, I’m starting to build up a friendship with her again. I just have a bad feeling because whenever we argue she always throws that in my face. Then, never apologises. 

I want to be friends because we are on the same sports team and it would be weird if we don’t get along. However, I feel like I am walking on eggshells. 

I want to call her and tell her how much what she said to me hurt and that we need to work on how we handle arguments. However, people keep telling me to wait until we build our friendship up more. But I think that if I wait until our relationship improves, if she gets mad at me about this it would hurt more.

Why does the man I’m seeing take it personally when other people approach me?,"I’ve been dating this guy for a couple of months, and I adore him. But recently he’s been acting very weird whenever other people compliment me or approach me in a romantic way. 

If he hears from anyone that someone hit on me or has feelings for me (even if someone else just compliments me) he takes it really personally and gets angry at me. And then he will turn it into an argument and start saying really manipulative things to try and make it seem like it’s a bad thing that other people desire me. 

Lastnight he stormed out of my apartment because he found out through a friend that a guy we are mutuals with approached me at a party that I was at a few nights ago. Nothing happened besides friendly chatter. He got angry and started ranting, when I told him he had no reason to worry or feel insecure, he tried saying something along the lines of “you wouldn’t appreciate it if I talked to random girls at a party” and I just shook it off and said that he’s comparing apples and oranges because I wasn’t the one who pursued the guy at the party, so it’s not a fair comparison. But he got angry anyways and shoved all his stuff into his backpack and abruptly left. 

I adore him and have feelings for him but I also would rather not spend 2023 having to constantly argue with him about why it’s not my fault that other people desire me. I’ve never given him a reason to feel this insecure, and if I’m being honest it’s a huge turn off. He usually ends up over apologizing when he doesn’t get a big reaction out of me, and I’ll just say it’s fine and we move on. But it’s still tiring. I’ve asked him why he gets like that and he just says he “gets in his head”. Idk how to feel anymore. 

Like I said I do have feelings for him and care about him but no amount of feelings is worth it to me to sacrifice my peace. What do I do?",,,,,,,,
I like paying $1 to $2 for psychic readers from Reddit to get readings on any guy I've been seeing for fun. Wanted thoughts on how weird this is?,"I used to do this a lot before, then stopped but I wanted to go back and get one on this guy that visited me a couple weeks ago, but I'm lowkey ashamed LOL. How weird is this?",,,,,,,,
sister being placed in foster care and I feel very terrified - any advice of what I can do to keep her safe?,"My (22Y) sister (15Y) has had a very tumultuous time at home and the social workers enforced a week time out where she has to stay somewhere else. Our support network is limited so she ended up having to go to a previous foster family’s home. I am living abroad so I can’t take her in.

I am having a lot of irrational fears and would love any advice on how to keep her safe. It’s with an elderly pair that used to be foster parents. They have an attic art gallery and the room next door will be turned into my sisters temporary room. It does not have a door. I am so stressed out of my
mind about things that could go wrong, like SA and none of us being able to pick up signals. 

My sibling feels a lot of anxiety about leaving too. Any advice on how to keep my sister safe? And if I can do anything to help her? 

Should we opt for having her stay with an uncle or aunt that wouldn’t be the best environment as they are extremely conservative and would remind her of home but at least I’m pretty sure she is safe there? 

Thanks a lot for thinking along.",,,,,,,,
can't wear green on st Patrick's day,"I don't like being touched. I can't wear green at work today (saint Patrick day) and I do *NOT* want to be touched. Mostly by customers. I'd prefer Noone do it at all but its easier to communicate this request to coworkers vs customers. You know how people are on this day.. they don't care if they know you or not they just don't see any green and make the move. Consent is not a thing on this day apparently. I'm afraid I will yell at someone or slap them away from me. I've had a customer touch my shoulder while walking away and I almost yelled at him because I don't like to be touched at all and it was unnecessary to touch me in the first place. 

I hated this day even before cvid and I still wear a mask (this post is not about cvid or masks so shut the fuck up if you're wanting to say something about it) so I'm extra on guard as it is and take steps back when people keep stepping closer to me (also did this before cvid as I like my personal space). 

How do I go about not being a ""Karen"" if people try to pinch me? Again, I'll be at work.",,,,,,,,
Lashes way more full &amp, long on one side?,Not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this in. But anyone have any ideas why my lashes might be a lot more full on one side and not the other? I don’t want to use serums I just want to know the root cause so I can fix it. Google just gave me medical diagnostics of course.,,,,,,,
Exercised and ate little to lose 10-12lbs but bigger overall,"⬆️Male aged 32) 

Before the pandemic I was a 6ft ectomorph (long legs short torso) tall slim lanky dude with a small head size to make it look normal 


▪️ since 1 year ago or so my face size has got bigger/thicker  (my head on hair on sides etc is the exact same no bigger there) 


▪️ so my hoodies fit the same but it’s like my head looks too big in them  (due to the face being thicker for them to fit and I have more of a pot belly too) 


▪️ALSO the same 32” pants are way tighter as my legs are a little bigger especially lower legs but my ankles and feet are the same as shoes still fit the exact same. 

*** i look longer legged or taller a little but idk if it’s the weight gain or growth. but at 32?***

I was Always the same type since 2010 ish etc and now this :/

***in 2019 I was thinner than now at the same weight (10.11 stone) and I was puffy faced tbh and I ate and ate up to 11.2 stone again and no joke my face slimmed down and I looked wayyyy better so should i do that?***

My body type is kinda the same but has more girth to it overall but it looks like I’m taller when I’m not 

Any advice?

conflicted on whether or not my ex's actions are weird,"i really didnt think much of these things until i saw a video ab the pigtail theory (pigtails apparently make a woman look more naive, sweet and innocent.) so basically my ex wanted me to wear pigtails and he'd always compliment me on them. nothing too serious alr. during spicy time i remember he called me his 'little girl' and he'd use other little names like that and i would call him daddy bc yk whatever, but idk if this is like weird or anything.",,,,,,,,
Strung Along About A Job,"Hello,

I’ve been working with my current company for about 17 years. If those 17, only 2 have been at the corporate office while the rest were in stores for some context on this issue I have. 

I was recently promoted about a year ago. Loved the job, but in all honestly I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would so I spoke to my boss about applying for another position which he was receptive to when the right one came along. 

About 3 months after that conversation I applied for a new role (which would also be a promotion). The second I showed interest in this role I was contacted by the supervisor of this role along with his boss. Both told me I was their “dream candidate” and that they couldn’t have asked for a better option. I also was told “I don’t even know why we are taking the time to interview you, this role was made for you”. So great! Got super excited and felt this was going to be a good fit, we discussed the job and how I would fit in to this new role and what my responsibilities would be along with who would be reporting to me. 

So I apply for the role. 

A couple weeks past and I get the interview scheduled with 4 different people. But before the interview, we have a meeting with the entire company. At this meeting I was approached by one person who could potentially be reporting to me asking if I applied for this new role… not sure how she found out because I literally told no one. I didn’t want to lie to her in case I potentially became her boss so I told her the truth. 

What I later found out is that several of the interview panelist were bringing up that I applied to the team I’d be managing. Btw I should also note that I used to work for this team and I felt like I was 50/50 on the staff who actually liked me. To be totally honest I do not feel I was well liked by that group in general. 

Fast forward to the interview, and DURING the interview I was asked about an “incident” at our all team meeting between me and this person discussing me applying for the role. I do not feel it was an “incident” by any stretch but apparently it upset her that I was applying for this role (please keep in mind I didn’t tell anyone). 

After interviewing I felt really weird that something was up. The interviews went well other than that one interviewers question. During the interview I was even told the other candidate was not qualified. 

Well fast forward to last week and I found out that I didn’t get the role. Which is fine, but I feel like I was either A.) Lied to, or B.) something happened when word got out I applied for this job and the team I’d work with argued against my application. 

Would love your opinion.",,,,,,,,
"28f, stuck, my life is stale, what should I do","Hello all,

I have an issue that's been sitting for some time, and I don't know how to deal with it, so please don't hold back...

I feel like my life is not moving, as if I'm stuck and all my investments had been perhaps a mistake due to lack of judgment or resolve... please share your insight

Two aspects in particular come to mind, the first is my mother and siblings, the second is my boyfriend..

My father was an alcoholic and hardcore drug user (heroin, cocain, etc) almost all his life and it was consuming him, it made him violent to the point police was looking for him in the neighborhood, went to jail a few times, but got out because he had connections, physically assaulted my mother and is just unstable..eventually as it got out of hand my mother kicked him out because he was living at her place, so he moved to his family's where his step daughters lived, who he loves a lot.. we on the other hand were always neglected, and he made it a point to always tell me that he married my mother out of pity, although she was working and had her place when she met him, he on the other hand was jobless and broke.. infact she had him get into reading she taught him so much and she helped him out of depression..but he never mentions it and will never admit it, he disowned me when i was born because he didn't want children, even had his friend falsely testify in court that my mother slept around.. which later proved to be false...he's just a bad guy and I quickly grew up understanding that i shouldn't rely on him... I was my mother's friend more than a daughter,  and I made it my life's mission to give her a better life... 

I was the first in the family to hold an engineering degree and I made sure my siblings had college education too, got on scholarships and I got them job offers to start as soon as they graduate and they got paid while studying too.. I made sure to give them allowances from my money while they were highschool students, while i was still a college student too.. I paid house bills and brought groceries.. I thought surely they'd want to make a better life for all of us too.. ?

My mother was working btw, she had a car and a personal debt and other responsibilities so my aim was to help her with her debts.. she shielded my siblings better than me in some aspects she hid some facts as to not impact their psyche, they never held responsibilities like I did tbh..

Fast forward few years and me and my siblings turned out different, they were comfortable with the easy life and wanted more.. I was still concerned with our and mom's future.. they seemed unreliable..

like one time my brother told me he prefers borrowing money from our mother because she doesn't ask for it back.. I told him I'm flexible that he could give it back whenever he had the money and he refused to take anything from.me..

Another time I had to pay before class registration opens, at the same time my sister needed money urgently, i lend her my card and insisted no more than a specific amount because i needed the rest... she just spent everything in it, we fought, she cussed out and that's the usual with her, no reasoning works, no matter the situation she guilt trips ppl and wraps it around herself which i call her out on so she just cusses out.... later I found out she bought herself stocks with it, which if it were me I'd never mess up someone else's whole semester for that let alone family.. i stood by her so much but to.no.avail

Several moments like that exist but this is just a sample, to understand how different our mental is

Fast forward a few years I'm working now, my mom is retired, she had multiple strokes last of which impacted the speech region, she's more like a child not her strong self anymore and easily cries over anything.. my sister was having worst tantrums and my mother would side with her everytime due to guilt.. it got so bad everytime I step in I'd get shunned out to the point no one actively shares anything of what's going on in the house with me anymore... things kept piling up until I gave my mom an ultimatum because i cant be shunned anymore, I'll stop taking care of everything and have my sister do it to which my sister promised she would.. nothing good came out of it

I lost my purpose in life kinda, and i just graduated and started working, I didn't know what to do with my life..at that point I got in a relationship, the guy was 23 and I was 26, tbh from day 1 he seemed to me like a gold digger, with my background I could tell, and it came out during our first fight he literally told me ""I demand you pay me an allowance $$$ per month"" in a text right after i wished him well..pretty disrespectful.. but as I had no friends and me being the me who points out other people's bullshit I called him out on it and he straightened up, this kept happening so many times and he changed to the better, he took me more seriously, his father passed away few years back and mother left as a child and he's living at his gramma, he's the youngest of his siblings...

Along the way he admitted his toxicity and I got over my paranoia doubtful self I even gained the confidence to say no, I stopped feeling shamed of saying the words ""i love u"" I understood the point of starting a family I understood life doesn't have to be as grim as what I saw growing up, that there's more to it, he too changed a lot to the better and admitted similar understanding.. I was able to trust people.. we experienced so many new things together because I decided to explore life and was okay with paying most, he paid too so he was taking stance which i appreciated.. I learned what a man is supposed to be from him as we bonded and interacted with many people because he was a social butterfly and I saw the better in people through his interactions.. and he saw the better in himself through me..

 but we could never get married for complicated reasons mostly legal and social.. I'm grateful for him but conflicted because I wanna get married to him and have a normal life.. I tried imagining myself with other ppl but it's difficult.. logically I know I should leave because this is not sustainable, and I tried breaking up so many times but he comes back insisting and i see no harm..but I don't know.. maybe I'm too comfortable? Also the dynamic in this relationship is less of man/woman more like mother/child although I never wanted the mother role he sorta reinforced it, whether it's abandonment issues or what idk.. it didn't bother me but it also makes me.feel.like what if I'm missing out on man/woman dynamic? The same way I understood the meaning of family through my own explorations rather than my household, I could be missing out on feeling like an actual woman rather than the role of a mother that somehow gets thrown whether I want it or not...

Keep in mind I was living like a stranger at home, I got pets two stray cats and a lizard that made my small world more alive...I got a car and I traveled.. with 2.5 years from the age of 26 27 and now I'm 28 turning 29 I've seen a better side to life.. I've learned to put on make up I've fixed my self up I've attended rave parties and understood the concept of good food good company and good fun... it doesn't have to be crazy expensive...

Well.. with that time in those 3 years my mom was with my sister actively shunning me..right now imo she look the worst I've seen her at.. few days ago I saw her crying telling me she doesn't deserve to live at the age of 65, she's scared shitless of my sister who's just 26 and just started working.. not to mention there's retirement money that's always gone.. again whenever I ask my mother gently about it or anything else odd to assess what's going on she herself hides things from me.. and I wish she spent it on herself but clearly not.. she's incapable of that like literally she needs someone to take care of her not to be taking care of a self centered 20 sth yo woman.. 

My brother was going to get involved with a bad bunch so I made ways for him to study abroad, the few times he's back from his vacation didn't make a difference he's only focused on him too it seems..

Imo this situation is wrong on so many levels, and I don't know what to do.. I got the chance to live life and I understand it is my mother's decision to side with her daughter.. I also understand that ever if I was trying to fill my father's spot I'll never be able to.. 

I thought a solution would be, to save up money and buy my own house, then move my mom in with me.. not just for her sake but my sake too, a house is gonna guarantee my rights especially with my dad being who he is and my siblings being unpredictable..I'll be able to protect my mother that way... this will also protect me from a potentially bad husband just like her, she simply kicked him out.. I should add her place is actually owned by the government so we don't know when we could get evicted.. to which we'll have to move at my dad's..  not a good scenario not hoping for it so

 I calculated it and to save up for down payment it'll take me 3 years, by that time hopefully recession would be over and interest would be low enough for me to get a house loan.. I hope my mom stays with us until then otherwise I'll feel lost again perhaps...

I wanna continue school but that seems like a privilege as I need a house now.. to my safety and to save my mom.. wanna get a PhD in sth at some point..

Please advise with whatever you can I would highly appreciate it as I have no one to guide.. 

Thank you..",,,,,,,,
Is it wrong to cut off friends if you don’t have the same sense of humor as them?,"I have some friends that are really nice, supportive, and overall really great. the problem though, is that they’re so unfunny 💀💀 idk what to do.

How do I (20F) gather up the courage to lose weight?,"I'm not asking for medical advice or how-to-lose-weight advice, mind you, but rather, self-motivation advice and how to get in the mindset for it. Have any of you been through it, what have been some motivators, have you had any help from friends or family, etcetera? 

I've been categorized as borderline morbidly obese by doctors, and I've been big since I can ever remember. But I've never been comfortable in my body and I'm aware that I'm allowing serious health issues if I don't do something about it before it's too late.

That said, it's really hard for me, considering my weight, to just suddenly start exercising every day, and cutting down on my meals. I have enough willpower to stop eating between meals and having midnight snacks if anything. But what I need most is the courage to decide on a date, and actually go and do it.

Any piece of advice would be lovely!",,,,,,,,

should I ask my friend if she’s ok?,"So two weeks ago I was talking to my friend and she said she needed some time alone. 

I get that, but as she is my only female friend I always get a little anxious. I have a deep fear of abandonment. 

So I gave her space and she asked me some things in the meantime, I answered but the conversation would usually stop there. 

She also sends me some funny reels sometimes but also doesn’t answer when I send her things back.

I’m just wondering if I should ask her it’s things are ok or continue to give her space. 

Honestly the reason I’m asking is because I’m scared that if I ask she’s gonna say something bad that I did and we will fight and I’m gonna lose her as a friend. I keep thinking about the last time we saw each other and everything I could have said wrong. 

Maybe I’m overthinking because if she was mad she would have talked to me at all, but it’s hard to know what people are thinking. 

So should I ask her is everything’s ok?",,,,,,,,
My friend’s boyfriend lurks through my Instagram stories and she doesn’t care.,"{For privacy reason’s,I will use fake names }

I (19 f) have a two friends , lily (18 f) and Brianna (19 f).
 This story is about lily , Who was in a relationship ,her bf Dave (20M) were toxic , from what she told me and Brianna.

Of course by nature as lily’s bestfriends , we were there for her and we tried our best to convince her to leave her bf .

I’ve heard the way he speaks to her and of course I don’t support them dating , But it was only so much Brianna and I can do . 

Lily also told us her bf doesn’t like us 
Of course that reason being , she  went out of her way to tell him what Brianna And I say about him.

Brianna and I eventually gave up on lily in general , I know that seems bad but we were genuinely so tired of trying to help her , we hated seeing her get hurt and she will ask us for advice but never took it .

So Brianna and I got in a mini argument with lily and just cut her off 

As they say , you can lead a horse to water but can’t force it to drink .

But we recently made up and moved on from it 

In that time being , I noticed Lily’s boyfriend ,Dave was and STILL IS Lurking on my Instagram 
He is also following me but I don’t follow back .

Now I’ll tell you my “relations” with Dave 

Three years ago , when lily and Dave was just friends. I was single in 2020 and wanted to mingle . so I posted on my story “ single hmu”
Lo and behold , Dave slides up .

Me and him flirted on snapchat 
and I think this lasted for a week or so. But I was never really interested in Dave as much so I didn’t text him anymore . 

Fast forward 
Then i got into a relationship with my now current boyfriend of three years .
( I love him very much )

TWO years later , lily and Dave date . She was aware of me and Dave’s little one week fling , she was ok with  it and continued to date him.
I didn’t care because it was one week who cares , ya know .

{Now back to the story I just wanted you to know because I don’t know if it’s a key part ?or something }
 
Now , from what I can remember 
Even from I think even before September 2022
Dave lurks on my Instagram and I know this by seeing him view my stories 
Whether it’s everyday or every other day .

I’ve told this to lily since THATS HER
MAN. 
Every time I’ve told her , she wouldn’t show much interest and 
All this time I’ve assumed she confronted him but it turns out she never did and I quote she said 

“ because I don’t know , I didn’t find the need to ?like I felt like he just went on his old account and look through people stories and stalk “

I think that’s weird af and I feel embarrassed for her , because how are you going to excuse his actions 

I have so many questions , like why doesn’t she care ?
Why does he stalk my social media ?
I thought he said he doesn’t like me ?
Why does he care about what I am doing ?

Now I know this seems like it’s not a big deal but he doesn’t even stalk Brianna but me !?

Dave and lily broke up a month ago but 
Yesterday I saw he looked at my Instagram stories AGAIN 
So I texted lily , I even told her how I felt .

I said “ it bothers me how you didn’t really care what he was doing. And stalking my social media “

I showed her the screenshot 

She didn’t respond to anything else except 
“He’s doing it again ? I’ll talk to him ,thank you”

….like what 

I asked her what she is thinking about this whole situation 

She said “ I’m thinking it’s weird , but he just told me he doesn’t use that account anymore “

I said “well he does because I literally have proof”

She says “ well he says he doesn’t “

Girl what the fuck you know damn well that’s a lie 

I just put a laughing emoji because what the actual fuck 
She just left me on read 

Everyone tells me he might still find me attractive or something along the lines 
I don’t if if that’s true because Dave said he doesn’t even like me or Brianna in his “relationship issues “


Any advice ?",,,,,,,,
Would Me (19F) Dating One Of My Dad's Friend (38M) Wrong?,"I've met him when I was 18.

We have secretly went onto dates, we text each other a lot and i love him and interested in him &amp; don't want to give him up neither does he. But keeping this from my dad feels like breaking his trust and would be ruining his friendship with his friends. I don't know what to do next. Any advice would be helpful.",,,,,,,,

Life messed me up,"This is a long rant

I (F18, 6ft tall, unattractive, overweight) have been dealing with depression and anxiety all my life. Even though Im not diagnosed whatsoever Im pretty sure I have several mental illnesses including something neurodivergent like ADHD or Autism because my parents have always been overwhelmed by my behaviours or emotions. My parents or rather my mother are horrible people, they mentally and physically traumatized me bascially from the get-go. For example: My father broke my teeth while pushing me into a steel bedframe out of anger and my mother told me to die when I was 11 without reason. My mother always saw me as an extension of her reputation and public image and always yelled at me for my abnormal/childish behaviour. Ive also been bullied for like forever, even before Kindergarten I was the weird kid and it stayed like that till I graduated. I have never had any friends in my entire life until 7 years ago when I met my best friend, and she is kinda a red flag and toxic ngl, and about 3 years ago my other good friend and they are all I have.

Ive been thinking about suicide for 6 years now but my friends, my pets and the fear of pain I have keep me from it. I have no motivation to do anything in life and I have an extreme apathy and hatred for people, which is ironic because Im currently working as a Caretaker for the disabled  (40h workweek and 515€ a month) because I was forced into it by my parents and my collegues told me I am not fit for this job. I am still living with my parents and they want to force me in another job immediately after my contract for this one ends. I dont want to do anything and I dont care if you see me as spoiled because of that I just want to make a lot of money either with an easy job or without working at all. My dream „job“ of course would be Sugar Baby but with my looks and personality that is not an option. Id like to get therapy and diagnosis but I dont have the time nor the money and there is none in my area (a village in a rural, german area). I am really desperate at this point so if any of you have good advice Id appreciate it. Pls refrain from mean comments, I have no self-esteem already.",,,,,,,,
"Sinking into a deep depression again, to a scary point. I don’t know what else to do to fix it and feel normal again.","Prefacing with I am actively seeking out a therapist. 

I’ll try to keep this short, but for the last few months I’ve been sinking into a very deep depression again. It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to socialize because I feel like I’m a bother to everyone and I’m better off not there at all. I feel like friends keep me around out of a courtesy, but probably plan things without me when they can. 

I have high functioning anxiety and depression, so it’s not impacting my ability to work (hopefully never will). I’ve been with my partner for 3 years and he is very supportive, though we’ve had a breach in trust a couple times and makes me wary to fully trust.

I’ve stopped initiating hangouts and conversations with people because I wanted to see if they would reach out to me first (I’m usually the first). Well, that has only shown me that nobody ever engages with me.. its really making me feel annoying, bothersome, weird, unwanted, etc.

Lately I’m feeling like I’m not worth having around at all, and it’s scaring me. I wouldn’t end my life, but it worries me when I feel such intense hatred/shame about myself. I used to be so social and outgoing, now I keep to myself because I think I probably bother people. 

I don’t have many friends who have similar interests or hobbies, so it was always tough hanging out and feeling “fulfilled” in that respect. I know a handful of people who have one hobby in common with me and we all know each other, but again, I feel like I’m a loser or weirdo to them.

I just want to go back to my normal, carefree, fun self and stop being so socially awkward and depressed. The amount of intrusive, negative, anxious thoughts is so prevalent now.",,,,,,,,
Finding out my favorite ex boyfriend,I recently found out my favorite ex boyfriend for Into a relationship and seem to always be treating the girls after me way better when i love him. Fuck it hurts. Been 5 years and always waiting on him and I’m honestly done waiting on him to come back. Even though we we’re together for 8 months it still hurts. He was the most real thing to “love” so much for giving them everything. I used to miss him everyday. Guess not so much anymore.,,,,,,,,
Is it okay to spend a gift card on an anniversary dinner?,"Okay hear me out, my parents have been married 35 years this Sunday. My dads birthday was in December and I gave him a gift card to a fancy restaurant. He wants to spend the gift card on his and my moms anniversary this Sunday. My mom thinks it’s not the right time to use the gift card cause it’s kinda like a recycled present but my dad thinks it’s the perfect time to use it. Keep in my mind neither of my parents are mad it’s more of a joke at this point. Also my parents are not tight on money so he doesn’t need to worry about spending money on their anniversary. I know at first it sounds like of course it’s fine but if you think about it I do see where my mom is coming from. But also my mom is the most easy going, calm, and rational person I’ve ever met so please don’t think she’s like the greedy type or something!",,,,,,,,
What do I do when no one comes in to relief me for my job?,"I am so upset and I feel like I am rightfully upset because I am working 11 pm - 7 am and my resident said someone would come in at 7 am and I mentioned to her I have an appointment at 7:45 am

Friendship advice,"HI. I have a friend who has been with me for 6 years. Recently, this guy has been in a friends-with-benefits relationship with his colleague for the past 6 months. After this girl comes into his life he is giving more importance to her than me. I feel left out and it's very hard to deal with it. I have a concern about this FWB relationship because this kind of relationship ends in a mess and I am really worried about him too. I miss my friend. What to do?",,,,,,,,
I’m sinking into depressing more and more each day and I don’t know what happened or how to fix it.,"Prefacing with I am actively seeking out a therapist. 

I’ll try to keep this short, but for the last few months I’ve been sinking into a very deep depression again. It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to socialize because I feel like I’m a bother to everyone and I’m better off not there at all. I feel like friends keep me around out of a courtesy, but probably plan things without me when they can. 

I have high functioning anxiety and depression, so it’s not impacting my ability to work (hopefully never will). I’ve been with my partner for 3 years and he is very supportive, though we’ve had a breach in trust a couple times and makes me wary to fully trust.

I’ve stopped initiating hangouts and conversations with people because I wanted to see if they would reach out to me first (I’m usually the first). Well, that has only shown me that nobody ever engages with me.. its really making me feel annoying, bothersome, weird, unwanted, etc.

Lately I’m feeling like I’m not worth having around at all, and it’s scaring me. I wouldn’t end my life, but it worries me when I feel such intense hatred/shame about myself. I used to be so social and outgoing, now I keep to myself because I think I probably bother people. 

I don’t have many friends who have similar interests or hobbies, so it was always tough hanging out and feeling “fulfilled” in that respect. I know a handful of people who have one hobby in common with me and we all know each other, but again, I feel like I’m a loser or weirdo to them.

I just want to go back to my normal, carefree, fun self and stop being so socially awkward and depressed. The amount of intrusive, negative, anxious thoughts is so prevalent now.",,,,,,,,
Changing jobs,"This is kind of a strange question maybe, but I need advice. I work abroad in a different country. I teach English and I’ve been here for 7 months. I met someone really special and we’re planning to move in together. However they are one city over and it’s kind of far. So I can’t keep my current job. My contract ends in August, and I could probably find another job but I like my job well enough. 
Here are my three options:

Sign a contract with the job and wait until April 2024 to move in with my partner. (This is a long wait and I don’t really want to do long distance for that long)

End the contract in August, find a new job, and move in with my partner. (The only issue with this is that they trained me for a part of the job that goes from April-April because this particular part is understaffed so they might be a little pissed)

Sign the contract until April 2024 but then leave part way through (They would definitely be pissed at me if I did this)

Couple other notes: the job environment is good compared to other jobs I’ve had but the hours suck sometimes, the shifts can be later in the day until 10 pm which can be tough for me.
I know I can easily find another job.
They have another office closer to my partner but there’s only a slim chance I would be moved there.

I’m just really stuck and need advice.",,,,,,,,

My wife doesn’t want to come to my best friend’s wife’s 40th birthday party?,"My best friend of 35 years (we’ve been friends since the first day of first grade) is having a big birthday party for his wife’s 40th. I’ve kind of been disconnected from them for some time now and we really don’t talk all that much anymore. His wife might as well be living on another planet because we don’t see her or haven’t heard a peep from her for over a year now. My wife has made several attempts to communicate with her in the past and although plans came to fruition for the most part, it was never reciprocated. My best friend was my best man at our wedding six years ago and my wife even chose his wife to be her maid of honor so that they could build a bond based on how strong mine was with my best friend.

Back to the birthday party…my wife isn’t comfortable going because the vibe isn’t very welcoming or inclusive. We’ll say hi to everyone and make small talk but that’s the extent of it and even though my wife makes attempts at striking up conversations, they end almost as quickly as they start. Having known my best friend for 35 years, I know his family very well and can chat with his brother about common interests. My wife had no problem with me going alone and said that she’d want me to go and have a good time and not be concerned about whether or not she’s feeling uncomfortable over there. I asked her if she’d be okay with going, having a drink or two, a bite to eat and then leaving early if the vibe is “weird”. Based on past gatherings, the overall vibe wasn’t exactly a welcoming one so I can sympathize with my wife 100%.

How would everyone here go about this?",,,,,,,,
Should I speak out?,"This is so random and it really shouldn't bother me at all, but for some reason it irks me. 

I work at a small company and we are really people-oriented. I feel very grateful to work for a company that truly values its workers and gives us great benefits. 

That being said, for every ""X History Month"" they send out a newsletter honoring people who fit that category. For example, for Women's History Month, the newsletter includes all of the photos of the women in the company. For black history month, they honored the one person who has very dark skin. That's fine and all, but I was a little pressed that I wasn't there. I am biracial and a lot of my identity comes from my black family as I was not close with my white family growing up. However, you couldnt tell just by looking at me that I'm black or mixed because I look straight white. Thus, I feel like the company only honored the other black person in the company because they are obviously black. 

I've been wanting to reach out to the lady who does the newsletters and just be like ""hey! Think of me next year! Honest mistake since I look white no problem!"" But I feel like it's too late because it's already mid-march. Should I tell her to just think of me next year or wait until next year comes and then bring it up?

Again idk why this bothers me so much I cannot for the life of me pinpoint why and I understand this is not a big deal at all. Regardless, I'd like some advice if possible.",,,,,,,,

Graduating with BA in May. Taking a gap year. What should I do?,"So I intend to go back to get my masters degree, but I’m graduating undergrad with a 2.9 most likely. I’m planning on building up my resume for 1 year and gaining some professional experience so I stand out in the application pool. 
I’m working a job that will be great for my resume and I’ve been there for two months. I’m considering leaving this job in May for a higher paying job (if I get it).

Is this morally okay? What should I do?,"Ive been having a bit of a crisis as of late. Ive been dating…Ill call him Jason, for about 5 months. Him and I are both Juniors, same age, and I met him at a really rough place in my life. He showed me genuine affection and I clung to it because, well, I wasnt getting much of it at home and Id recently gotten broken up with. He was really nice, everything Id ever wanted….at first-

This issue is…Ive been…unhappy as of late. Jason embarrasses me almost constantly, will NOT stop touching me IN CLASS to save his own life (to the point the school had to call our parents about it), he complains about everything I do, and is just overall getting on my nerves. Its been like this for about a month or two. This is the root of the my problem. For those who will say “sit him down and talk about it”….we have. Every day. For the past month. Nothing has changed…minus my fading feelings for him. I love him, but I cant see myself living like this. I tried to leave him once before. A few weeks ago I got fed up but he begged for a second chance and I gave in….ugh I regret it.

Along with that…Ive caught feelings for other people…2 people. For privacy’s sake Ill call them April and Ryder. April is also a Junior, but Ryder is a freshman. Yeah…thats where Im morally questioning everything. Im in a much better place now and I’m now clinging to the first person that shows me affection….and Ive realized there are people I REALLY love and not clinging to out of desperation…

Now…April, Ryder, and I are all polyamorous. We have all openly (and awkwardly) expressed feelings for each other. Jason…is not poly. I mean, dear god- He threw a fit when I leaned my head on a friends shoulder because I had a KILLER migraine, for fuck’s sake. 

April I don’t have a problem with, shes beautiful and we get along amazingly…but Ryder…is it immoral to have feelings for him? He’s so funny…and caring…and god damn he’s really smart (he’s taking Sophomore and Junior classes and is on track to graduate early). Ryder is an amazing guy…I can be myself around him without fear Im doing something wrong…but he’s a freshman and Ive been told both sides; that its okay and that its wrong. So- here I am. Questioning my life. Obviously there would be no NSFW shit until he reached the age of consent, Im not TOO dumb. 

Anyways…I guess my question is…what should I do? I still love Jason, but I cant stand the baggage he brought. Even IF I leave him…is it morally acceptable to start a (poly) relationship with Ryder and April (after I calm down from a break-up with Jason of course). I just…I dont know what to do-

I feel like my mother is moving on too quickly after my fathers death but I still want her to be happy.,"Hello my fellow redditors, something has happened in my life and I don't truly know how to think about it. 

So my father passed away almost a year ago from today (2 weeks and it will be a year from today) and my mother has already been dating someone for 2 months and told me yesterday that she was planning on moving in with him after I graduate high school which is only in this may. I am not worried about supporting myself cause I have a job and a plan for what im doing after high school but im more worried about my mother. I knew that sooner or later, she was gonna find someone else but I didn't realize that it'd be this soon and im absolutely terrified. I'd like to be happy for her but I just have a large sense of dread for the future now that I see that she is moving away a lot sooner then I thought she would.

How to reconnect with a lost friend- we are both stubborn,"Many months ago I told my best friend we should take a break from each other. We had been friends through high school and we were changing and growing and I felt we needed a break because we were starting to butt heads. The last straw for me was She didn’t want me around her boyfriend, and I wanted to know what type of person her boyfriend was. We tried to talk it out, but it was clear she couldn’t express herself honestly to my face. It’s been months, what I thought would be a break for us to collect ourselves and see if we would work it out has turned into more. She unfollowed and unadded me on ALL social media within the last month. I was fine with interacting with her on social media- we just needed a break. What do I do now? Any tips? Do I just- let it go…. I’ve been waiting for her to come to me, since I was the one that said the last words.",,,,,,,,

Should I start dating?,"I'm M18 and I've never been  in a relationship... well, not completely ""never"" but I don't think is worth mentioning anything bellow 14. 

Recently I started to think that my ""golden age"" is going away without me enjoying it. I never felt the need to start any romantic relationship or deepen a  relationship with someone. Another thing that concerns me is that if I don't have a few experiences while I'm still young it might become difficult in the future when i search for something more serious. 

I guess my personality has much to do with it since I'm an introvert (many people confuse introversion with social anxiety, I'm don't have social anxiety at least is what the doctor said), i like to spend a lot of time alone doing my hobbies or just diving into my thoughts.

I don't have any major problems walking to girs, well I'm not a Brad Pitt-like guy or whatnot but I'm kinda charismatic, i guess? Recently one of my close friends confessed her feeling towards me, i didn't how to answer. On one hand I don't what to turn our relationship into some awkward situation, on another hand I don't want to lose my comfort. So I told her that I needed to think about it (she knows about my situation, so I guess she will understand). There's nothing wrong with her, she's cute, beautiful, has a good personality (well, she has her drawbacks too) and all, the problem is really with me.

I hope there's someone more experienced about this matter or someone that has been through the same situation as mine. I hope you can give me an advice.

I am ashamed of myself for not having any work experience and it keeps me from finding jobs.,"I am almost 27 years old and I wasted most of my 20s. I kept switching careers paths and I never sticked to one and I kept giving up because I felt like I wasn't able to get those certifications.

I feel utterly worthless now. I am ashamed of my CV. I am ashamed of myself. I feel like there's no way I can show the world that I have value because they'll ask for a CV and if they see I have no work experience they just discard my application.

What should I do? No matter how much I tell myself that it's not too late to make things right reality keeps remembering me the fact that I have no work experience.

Roommate keeps taking my boyfriends meds,"Okay so I'm not sure where else to turn but here we go. I live with 3 other people one of which is my boyfriend.

However there is one big problem sam. Sam for a while now has been stealing medication from my boyfriend and even from llyn! These meds are extremely important to both of them as they need them to function. It's Adderall (they both have adhd.) It's really pissing me off because everytime he does it they just give him a swat on the finger and tell him ""no no"" and that's that. But I'm afraid he's going to go after mine as if going after theirs isn't bad enough. I have a bad heart, bipolar and lupus to deal with so my meds getting stolen would be detrimental. And the other day I had noticed that two were already gone from my meds case but I drop stuff all the time so I figured I had dropped them. But then my boyfriend told me this morning about how some of his we're gone and now I'm even angrier. If someone could please help I'd be so happy!

Should i keep to using hair thickener spray? Have mixed feelings,"Male aged 32)

Last night I was the same looked olive skinned and puffy and I look zonked out eyes

I have a black hair high hairline receding on the temples which can look thick but is thinning underneath so density can be a problem

I put in this black hair thicknening spray Iv had but never wanted to use and a dash in my temples and on the front and my skin looked whiter and clearer my eyes looked younger

I just started a job and have a few concerns?,"I just recently started my new job i’m not saying where but I sell jewelry. It’s only my 4th day and I have some concerns. Today one of my coworkers went out to get lunch, I originally wasn’t going to get anything because I don’t carry cash and had no way to pay her back. She had gotten an extra free kids meal with it and asked if i wanted it so I was like “yes bet”. we all were eating in the front( it was dead at that time) a little while later I realized no one was going on break so I asked if I could go on break and my other coworker i’ll call D said “ we don’t get breaks if someone brings everyone food.” It doesn’t seem right to me. 

I also am concerned about one of my managers i’ll call her C I don’t know her very well yet but i feel like she is very very stressed and just needs a break. I say that because she takes her anger out on her coworkers and gets confused for example today C told a customer of D’s he had to pay $700 for his earring repair/replacement a little while after he leaves and had paid she tells D that she didn’t tell the customer $700 she told him 1,000….. huh she does a lot of stuff like this.

Another time C had told me to answer the phone for a little, and when we answer the phone we have to get the customers name, phone number, and their ticket number for ANY call don’t matter who it is or what they want so we can check on their jewelry and call them back no problem… the problem is I had a complaint on the phone and was explaining to me that the prongs to her ring were not the same color of the band of the ring and I got her number and her name but forgot the ticket number ( oh no) and as im ending the call C walked up to me and said something along the lines of “phone calls shouldn’t be more than 5 minutes.” I was on the phone for less than 3 minutes I don’t know what to say to that so I awkwardly say “okay” then she ask “did you get her info” i said “yes but i forgot the ticket number” then she rolls her eyes and walks away in a rude way but D thought me how to pull someone’s ticket up and you really don’t need the ticket number at all not even to go look for the actual item. 

I really like this job I just don’t know how to deal with my manager. any advice?",,,,,,,,

How do I reconnect with old online friends?,"I (24f) met a group of good friends around 6-7 years ago in an online game. We hung around consistently for the first two years but after I took a 6 month break, others decided to take breaks inconsistently too. Right now, there's only two of them somewhat active (Friend A and B). For reference, they're both male and I'm assuming in their late 20s.

What I've always loved was the way I could come back after being inactive for a few months and be treated as if nothing had happened. Friend A in particular I feel like makes an effort to try and hang out with me at least once when I come back.

I would say I am close friends with them but from an third person perspective you might disagree. I have never talked to them on voice chat, which tends to be a big icebreaker thing for online friends. I have never talked about myself (my age, what I study or do, my hobbies, anything really). I was really closed off and severely introverted 6-7 years ago which caused this wall or boundary to be built and they've become accustomed to that and now never ask me anything or try to question me too far.

I'm now suffering from that as a consequence. I am a lot more open now and down to talk about anything with them (even voice chat) but these two friends don't realise that because it's kind of weird for me to just do a 180 and say to them they can ask me anything? I feel like that would pressure or put them off more, plus I don't even know if they care enough to begin with.

So now I'm stuck in this situation, where I want our friendship to grow stronger but I can't do it. I want to be true lifelong friends with them. I want to meet them one day, hug them, travel and have fun in the real world. I want to share our struggles and bad times together too. I have these dreams and wishes but feel like everything is stopping me from taking the first step.

I recently came back online again two months ago and have been online basically every day because I'm trying to put in effort for this to work. Friend A again hung out with me once, and was online almost everyday until he suddenly disappeared for two weeks around Valentine's (reasons unknown) and since then has been very inactive, only coming online to play with me and Friend B whenever the stars aligned I guess (around 4 times in the past month). I don't know what happened and it worries me a lot because he's usually way more active. He has been online on Discord though, just not playing the game. You might think he's been playing other games but I have received no signs of such.

Friend B is online more often, being here almost every day but only stays for around an hour. I'm less close with him than Friend A but nonetheless we are good friends. I initially had a couple long conversations with him about health, food, games etc, and thought it was going well but now it's become really stale. 

We would just say hi and some passing words before standing in silence because there's literally nothing to talk about. I managed to befriend him on Steam and on the Switch and even played another game with him briefly, but again, this was a few weeks ago and it's stale now for some unknown reason. 

I brought up some courage today and messaged him on Discord (for the first time) saying hi happy early birthday (his birthday is tomorrow) but the conversation died soon after. 

I don't think I'm coming off too strong considering this is all over the course of a month or so? Someone told me I'm just expecting too much and that I should lower my expectations which I somewhat agree with, but it's just so frustrating, I just want to be friends and talk why is this so hard.

I also have this crippling social anxiety that consumes me when I want to message Friend A on Discord (our last and only messages were from 3 years ago). I feel so stupid being in this situation and a part of me is just accepting the fact I'll probably never meet them in my lifetime, let alone be close to them as humans. There's so much I want to talk about, and I'm sure they've been through a lot too in the past few years. It's just so strange that no one wants to hang out with me anymore (I'm not usually active for this long). I keep getting my hopes up only to have them crash down. I don't understand them and they don't understand me. I want to give up sometimes but I also don't.",,,,,,,,

My sibling is told me thier trans and i dont believe them,"My sibling told me yesterday that he is trans. I love my sibling so much, and I want them to be happy but I'm so incredibly worried that this might be another case of taking on the personality type of the person they are dating. They were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder amongst a handful of other mental health issues. 

Every person they date, they become. Last year they started dating a trans man. To be honest, though it was new to us, the trans man is still very feminine so we just didn't see my sibling transitioning. There have been zero signs and yesterday informed me that they have started taking hormone treatments. 

I'm worried that he might regret doing this to his body. I'm worried about the discrimination he might face. I'm worried about how my parents are going to feel like it will break them.  I feel like I should tell them to protect them from my brother blindsiding them. I want him to be happy, I do but this hurts. I'm not sure I can come to call him my sister. I love him so so so much. I will always be there for him and I will treat him with respect. I just have a more traditional view of gender. Every article and support blog I read says don't be sad that you lost a brother, be happy you gained a sister it's still the same person. However, he is a new person every time he dates someone. I don't want another sister, I want my little brother back. Of course, I want him to be happy, I'll respect him and be there for him. 

I'm seeking two pieces of advice - 

1. My brother said he is going to break the news in a letter. All of us siblings live out of state and I'm worried that my parents to be alone when he breaks the news. They are in town this weekend and I feel like I should tell them even though he asked me not to. I'm usually the sibling that he can confide in but I'm so worried about how my parents will take this. I don't want them alone when he breaks the news. I want to be there for them. Should I tell them? 

2. He and his fiancee's family is extremely left-wing/progressive. I'm worried that my more traditional views on gender might be misconstrued as transphobic. He knows I love him and will always be there for him and his fiance.  I'll support him.  Though I am agnostic and my views lean more left, I do have a more traditional view on gender. It feels like in this day in age, if you don't agree then you are against it. Any tips on how to support my sibling without being labeled transphobic?",,,,,,,,

I feel that Amy gives susan more attention than she gives me and whenever susan is around she talks to her more than she does to me. It's clear that susan prefers amy over me and honestly I'm fine with that. It's just that I feel used because whenever both of them have some kind of work they call me because I have the car.  Susan also has one but she is not at home much because of classes and her parents don't give it to her sometimes.
There have been many instances where I have been hurt because of Amy but i dont know if she realises it or not. I always put the blame on myself telling her it's okay and it doesn't matter or whatever. These things when seen individually are ""nothing"" but it has been a long time now and I feel exhausted. Today she called me when I was sleeping to ask me if I wanted to go out for cycling later. I woke up and said yes and around the time we had to go out I texted and called her. She didn't reply. I went to her house and waited for around 20 minutes, later I find out that she already went out with my sister. This may be nothing but honestly I felt so angry I dont even know why. I met her after an hour or two and told her she ditched me. She told me that she thought I was not coming and saw my sister and they went together on their cycles. I was mad but I didn't want to seem petty or make this something significant and just went home. As friends she asks me for some things that she needs and I go out of my way to help her and I expect on some level the same thing. I sometimes go out late at night to get her some printouts that she needs for school, pay for her in the canteen and more. In the 10 years we've been friends, she has done no such thing even once. 
Also I am pretty extroverted but I NEVER have trusted anyone enough to show myself as vulnerable or weak in any sense all my life. I really do not want to talk to her about how she is hurting me but I want her to know(this is weird ik im sorry) 
Am I totally overreacting over a petty thing?",,,,,,,,
How many days of notice does a person who’s doing an internship while living in a different country(outsourced) have to give in order to leave the job ?,"I’m currently working for a Singaporean company and I want to leave. But since I’m an intern I don’t know how long I have to give notice for.
On the contract it says it’s governed by Singaporean law, but I’m living in a south Asian country. 
When I checked online it says an intern only needs to give one day notice.Please any lawyers who know about Singapore as well as internships in Singapore help me out here.

A delusional teenager I work with is telling people we're dating,"Alright! So I don't know what to do about any of this. I (20F) am a server at a local restaurant. I have a decent amount of underage coworkers that I'm always nice to because I remember what it was like to be a teenager around adults who hated me. However, this one busser (16M) has gotten some sort of delusion in his head that we're dating, and I'm worried it's going to ruin my life.

I've heard from coworkers who are my age AND who are his age and go to school with him that he's been saying we've had sex, I've performed sexual acts on him, and that my long-term partner who I talk frequently abojt at work is a cover story.

I've spoken to him about this, I've spoken to my managers (unfortunately they can't schedule me around him, against corporate rules.) Every single time someone mentions these rumours I vehemently disspell them, but it's all just getting worse and I'm afraid he's going to absolutely ruin my life.

Unfortunately quitting isn't an option as this is the only place I can work with my school schedule, and I've gone as far as threatening legal action. I'm at a loss as to what to do to make these rumours stop besides finding a way to contact his parents and begging them to get him help. What do I do?! I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack...",,,,,,,,
Lorazepam and alcohol?,"Last night I took lorazepam before bed for anxiety, and today I have drinking planned with a friend. Should I be fine?",,,,,,,,
Fear of sleeping.,"So I’ve been having a specific problem ever since I got my first actual job. 

For some context, I’m the type of person who is rather… “fashionably” late at most things. I was also raised in a country where the people are known not to be very punctual. However after I became 18 and I moved to a different country, the cultural differences started to become more clear. I lived for a good amount of time with a person who consistently drilled into my head that being late was not acceptable whatsoever, from doctors appointments to other social stuff. 
That was until I started working, said person micro-managing me since they too worked there before (they helped me get the job).
So my work is fairly laid back, I basically manage a museum. It opens at 9am, I always come around 9:02-9:03am, no later than that. Even if I’ve been chastised for it, (not by my boss), I don’t think that there’s any problem with that time. 
I would also like to point out, I don’t mind that person that much anymore since I’ve learned how to handle them and their controlling tendencies, so I’d say they’re not much of a concern but rather an annoyance that just adds more fuel to an already existing fire.

Now for my main issue. Ever since I started working, I am afraid to fall asleep at night, in case I don’t wake up on time tomorrow. It’s something I do subconsciously, I get so tense whenever it’s time to lay down that I have to remind myself to relax and unclench my muscles. It’s gotten to the point where I lay awake till 3-4am, which of course the next day I have to wake up to go to work. 
The first few days of the week I can manage, sometimes I even ‘break’ my sleep by having 4 hour long “naps” after work, waking at around 2am, do whatever i have to prepare for the next day, and sleep again for another couple of hours. 
It always gets worse by the end of the week, where exhaustion catches up and that’s where I actually find myself in the situation I’ve tried to avoid so much before. I’ve messed up a lot of Fridays for exactly that reason. I’m too scared to take melatonin or Xanax to help me sleep faster in fear that they’ll just make me sleep even heavier. 
I forgot to mention, usually I’m a heavy sleeper, however I think I’ve trained myself to change that. 

On the weekends I sleep 15+ hours to make up for the lack of rest. I feel like a damn robot that functions with a battery instead of a human atp. I’ve never had that problem with school before since I didn’t care that much and there weren’t serious repercussions. I just don’t want to get fired for something stupid like that yet I still do it. I know that everything would be easier if I simply just went to sleep earlier, and I wouldn’t have to worry about not waking up since i would be well rested, but it seems impossible to me. 
I also live alone so there’s no one to share this concern with. It has taken a severe toll not only on my body but also my mind , and though I struggle with timelines but I believe I’ve worked here for at least 1.5 years now. I just don’t know what to do and I refuse to believe I’m alone in this. I sometimes wish I didn’t have to sleep at all, just so I can always be alert and aware of my surroundings. 
I set up at LEAST 7 alarms on my phone. I’ve tried calming music, background noises, reading, yet nothing works. It’s always in the back of my mind that whenever I’m asleep I’m vulnerable and not in control and that scares me. Whenever I try and fix it I always succeed for a few days then the cycle starts again. If i were to describe it with a metaphor it would be like a snowball falling down the mountain and eventually getting bigger and bigger until it destroys everything in its path before coming to a stop. And then repeat. 
The weekends don’t even feel good anymore as I find myself just doing absolutely nothing while I recover.
I feel like I cannot escape it. 

I think my priority is to find someone I can relate to, since so far no one seems to understand it. 

Apologies for the novel, I hope I was able to explain it properly. I appreciate any and all advice . :)",,,,,,,,
Is it ok to reach out after being blocked because of something you had no part in?,"I have 2 people in my life. Person B and C. They never met eachother. I got really intense with person B, we lived together the past 2 months. I expressed my feelings and she needed time to think about it. I gave her time and went back to my place. I met up with person C and talked about the situation. He got angry telling me that she strung me along for 2 months and that it was not ok for her not to discuss it straight away. I told him that she should be able to take as long as she needed. 

I got a call the next day from her that she was being harassed and insulted by person C. She accused me of sending him after her. She hung up and blocked me before i could say anything. I’ve talked to person C and cut him out of my life, blocked him everywhere. 

This happened 2 weeks ago and i have not yet reached out to person B. I’m not bothered by losing person C, but i have a hard time coping with losing B. Is it okay for me to reach out to her to explain that i have had nothing to do with it? Is it still too soon to reach out? Or it it simply never up to me to reach out? She blocked me on whatsapp and i’m afraid to cross her boundaries by simply calling/mailing her about it. It breaks my heart that i lost her because of the actions of someone else. I have no one left now and i’m losing my mind over how this went. I do have text messages in which i strongy told person C not to contact person B.",,,,,,,,

"THE REPLIES YOU GET FOR ""MISOGYNY"" ARE ALWAYS WORSE THAN WHAT YOU SAID","I find that certain Ideals can ruffle the feathers of female users and even some of the males that cape for them. Offending others is no less uncommon than accidentally pushing past someone in a busy hallway. It's going to happen. 
What I find ironic is one may say something like 

"" women these days just want men for their money"". Sure some people may disagree. Sure that is a limited worldview. But it is a sentiment nonetheless. But then here comes the replies:

You sound like an incel
You are ugly that's why women only want money from you
Stop d**k riding andrew tate
Okay maybe you should date men then
etc etc.

One would assume that such statements woukd be more damaging to OP than OP's opinion would be to the world. So for sharing an opinion people make it their job to make sure you feel as low as possible and the the internet *just allows it*. But the post itself, nah that's *offensive* part.",,,,,,,,
government flags have no good purpose in the current era,"recently i have been into a flag-designing kick and it has made me reflect on why we have flags at all. i thought about how the original flags might have come about and their purpose. i thought about what they represent and how they represent those things. no matter how much i have thought about it i can think of no good reason why a person should be loyal to a flag that represents a city or state. 

in the best cases, you might fly a flag that represents your ideals, there are lots of those. they make some sense but even then it is the epitome of virtue signaling. that is to say that flying such a flag does nothing to support that cause, it simply associates you with that cause with almost zero effort or support.

lastly, flying a flag is loud. it is screaming to the world that you are your association and it makes me not want to associate with you even if i like the cause or government but especially if i don't like the cause or government.

now, when i see people flying various flags i cannot help but think that they are people that i just don't want to be around.

pretty much the only thing i like about flags now is the challenge of creating an attractive flag that does a good job of representing a region or idea (assuming a flag can even do that). after i have created the flag i feel icky for having wasted my time. 

in order for me to accept challenges to my view, i must preemptively admit that i could be looking at this wrong and that if i am looking at this wrong it would be better for me to know.

It does not make sense to diagnose people with depression,"Controversial, I know, but hear me out:

First, the wording of the title here is very deliberate. We can argue whether depression as we know it is ""real"", but that is another issue entirely. I am simply skeptical of the idea that depression is a diagnosable illness. Depression exists to the extent that some people are more inclined towards the emotions associated with depression. There seems to be some dispute as to whether that it best characterised as sadness or ""emptiness"" or as its own emotion entirely, but what we term this emotion is not relevant here. I am simply acknowledging that some individuals are significantly more inclined towards these emotions than others, and this is essentially what we seem to be diagnosing as depression.

My qualm here is that this could simply be interpreted as somebody's character, personality, or temperament. Why should it be assigned its own illness? Can any feature of somebody's temperament be diagnosed as a mental illness now? Because that seems to be the precedent that is being set by the mental health positive crowd. Especially as I am now seeing the phrase ""toxic positivity"" floating around. It seems as though this is another way to malign those with a certain temperament, though instead of melancholy, it attacks optimism. There are obviously mental illnesses where this is not a concern; if you consistently hear voices in your head, it would not be far-fetched to find yourself diagnosed with schizophrenia. But I fail to see how somebody being more likely to feel depressed at any given time is grounds for claiming they are ailed.

There's also no metric with which we can quantify one's degree of sadness. We can not claim that depression can be diagnosed when somebody consistently reads as a six on the sad-ometer. Therefore, how can we be certain that somebody does indeed have depression?

In fact, it would seem to be in the interest of the psychiatric community to diagnose as many people as possible with depression to maximise profit. Whether or not you support capitalism, you have to acknowledge that the medical industry must be approached a healthy skepticism, for the more ill you are, the more doctors profit. Psychiatry appears to be most prone to this, as there are no external realities to compare the illness in question with. For instance, a physiologist can not convince you that you have a broken leg if you can walk painlessly. However, if the patient does not have this external reality for comparison, how are they to know whether their degree of sadness is average? They can be convinced that they are abnormally depressed without the means the dispute it, and then sold therapy and drugs.

Most importantly, diagnosing depression makes me fear what ideology we are perpetuating. If we say that those who are more sad than others are mentally ill, we are essentially promoting one singular way of thinking and perceiving the world and maligning those who do not through the guise of sympathy. Forgive me, but I cannot support that idea.

So, I suppose those are my main qualms about diagnosing depression:

1. It is illogical to diagnose an element of somebody's temperament
2. There is no way to quantify emotions and therefore no threshold in which depression can be diagnosed.
3. Depression can be used by psychiatrists to scam money from the vulnerable.
4. Diagnosing and treating depression promotes a sole world view and discourages diversity of thought.",,,,,,,,
People shouldn't complain about not being welcomed or accepted in a country if they don't belong into the ethnic group,My perspective is that if a country is mostly a homogenous race/ethnicity there shouldn't be complaints about not being seen as one of them or treated the same way as they treat locals. I mostly hear this about asian countries treating foreigners differently be it bad or good treatment. The reason why I say these people shouldn't complain is because the same thing probably happens in there country so there is a level of hypocrisy. Asian students that transfer to America don't get treated the same as a white person born in america. Now this might sound like whataboutism which there is some level of but I'll also answer why people shouldn't get mad at this with a different example that has nothing to do with race and culture. If you were middle class you would often avoid or suck up to a rich person that just spawned in front of you. Since it is someone who lived a lifestyle you don't understand. Would a rich person be welcomed in a homeless shelter just loitering around having a good time?,,,,,,,,

"Porn is still in high demand here in the west because of basic misunderstandings in our culture where men and women still can't ""get along ""","Our society propagates extremist feminist narratives that have yet to be dismantled. How are they still here? Any of these examples ring a bell?:

1. A father in a playground with his child? must be  a pedo, call 911!. Thats the default assumption
2. A guy out on the street? must be upto no good. Why is he hanging about? is he a criminal? yet we would never expect a woman to be a criminal. We'd think she's waiting for friends or a uber ride. But a guy alone? He's clearly upto no good and has no friends! /s
3. Ask any real man, he'll have dozens of examples.

This whole CMV would require you to take yourself out of ***your*** ordinary working work environment (where perhaps men and women have no issues talking about all sorts of things with zero repercussions, tension or hostility, due to enforced policy and money at stake) and think about the bigger picture, out on the actual street, what's happening to our culture and people's minds at a larger scale.

* Women at large don't want to understand men, and men gave up trying. There's only so much truth a woman can handle before it bores her. Men learned this the hard way, it's a sad thing but it's just a part of the culture we grow up in. 
   * So what is there left to do? Talk to these forever closed-minded women? If women at large are only offering sex, sex is all the men can look forward to and chase. It's no wonder what men are upto, but it baffles why women are persistently blinded by their own tight-arse,  [***frigid***](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AJOqlzU4GDf3WfX1JPOHteVN3V658MUUDQ:1679002175060&amp;q=frigid&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLxOLBsuH9AhUFwjgGHWxAARIQBSgAegQIDRAB)  ass ideologies. Then they complain ""where are all the good men"". Excuse me, but what?
* Common, (especially the go-getter) Women who at the drop of a hat,  fall back on their own beliefs to get in with the seemingly all-powerful (attractive) extremist  Feminists, whenever they feel like it! Whose opinion is summed up as #killallmen. These gross generalizations and sly agendas (regardless of credibility) held by tight extremist feminists fuels our constant inability to calm down in the face of adversity, Problematic for all men and women.

It enables the flight or fight response, the wrong nervous system is triggered by these heated, one-sided people with a constant chip on their shoulder. and the conversation never amounts to anything good whatsoever but manically pissing everyone  off, making hostile and closed-off minds hardened time after time. 
* ***When you put the value of gynocentrism above men, you end up with more Neets and more demand for materialistic women to fill the void, not less.***  Thats' exactly what we're seeing when you take off the blinders. Extremism is doing no favors for feminists either.

Not a feminist. Why is it called feminist, instead of humanist? **Riddle me this**

Now about porn. It's simple. Women are waving their genitals (figuratively? literally!) around in the street but not giving any to 80% of the men so men have to invent more porn to get off. Frigid Feminist Culture encourages porn to get more degrading. It's simple.  When something poses resistance, you have to find another more complex way to let it go. If there's no resistance then there's no need for more porn. If extreme feminists were all killed off tomorrow, the culture would move back in the right direction, slowly. Not hating the extremists feminists themselves, just stating facts. They don't know what they're doing to men.",,,,,,,,
set point theory is real -- once you get fat it's more or less permanent,"I would very much like to get my view changed on this, but haven't really found a much debate regarding this.

For those who don't know, set-point theory basically says that once someone has gained a certain amount of weight that has been kept on for an extended period of time, the body will not (over the long term) allow the body to stay at that weight. This relates to metabolism etc. although I don't really understand the biological aspect of it.

I don't think many here would doubt that theres some level of bounce back effect with weight and metabolism, but the question is can that be overcome?

Anecdotally this has been my observation. I've never met someone who was obese and developed into athletic or skinny shape for the long haul. I think at the high ends it can work, like sure maybe a 400 pound person can become a 300 pound person in the long haul, or maybe someone can lose 20 pounds and keep it off but it seems nobody obese can become skinny. 

I read one viral clickbait story of a bodybuilder who became obese and lost it as a challenge so he could relate to his patients, but I don't think something like this would disprove it as he wasn't obese long enough for a ""set-point"" to develop. 

It's certainly possible that it's possible, but just extremely difficult. The same way 95% of businesses fail, simply because it's hard and not because theres some biological reason for it. But i've yet to see any counterexamples. Does anyone have any? Even anecdotally?",,,,,,,,
Japan has probably done enough to apologize for WWII,"**Reading materials:**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_of\_San\_Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Francisco)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese\_war\_crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_war\_apology\_statements\_issued\_by\_Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing\_Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre)

**Preface:**  
I believe Japan committed war crimes, up to and including genocide, before and during WWII. I am not an apologist for Japan's actions in any way. The Japanese fascist imperialist state acted in aggression upon other countries.  However, I believe Japan has sufficiently apologized for its actions. Also, I won't downvote anyone in this thread.  I'll be able to spend about 2 hours in this thread and I'll read replies after, too.

**My position:**

Immediately following its defeat, Japanese war criminals were tried, with many of Japan's government executed. Japan paid reparations to the countries it assaulted\* which often totaled several years worth of those countries' GDP in addition to giving land back - though even this amount is low to me, it was an amount decided on by Japan and its peer nations at this time. Since then, Japanese politicians at the highest levels of government have apologized readily, often, and willingly - until recently. 

\*This asterisk is for China, which I will get to later.

**Arguments against my position that have not yet convinced me, but maybe could if people put some additional context/effort into them.**

1. **Some nations have not accepted Japan's apologies, and therefore, the apologies are not good enough.** Not accepting Japan's apologies allows Japan's neighbors to seek additional grievances and make claims against Japan's government that allow politicians to whip up fervor amongst their base. I believe there is a perverse incentive for many nations to not accept or downplay Japan's apologies.
2. **\*Japan hasn't done enough to acknowledge crimes against China and Nanking.** This is a particularly difficult thing for Japan to do because the Chinese government's official estimates of losses and crimes committed against their citizens is inflated. For example, the consensus estimate for the death toll at Nanking is 200,000 people. China's estimate is 100,000 (33%) higher. 
3. **The recent Japanese governments, especially under Shinzo Abe refused to apologize, and this indicates Japan as a nation is not sorry.** How I read the situation is that Abe is done with the apologies. Abe's predecessors apologized openly and often, even after Abe was the prime minister. I think if I was in Abe's shoes, I wouldn't apologize either, because the apologies are never good enough. That said, Abe's *denial* of some aspects of the war, eg. comfort women, is unforgivable. Abe is now dead so we will never hear him apologize.
4. **There are factions within the Japanese government and society that downplay the war and other atrocities.** I agree this is a problem, but there are science-denying, history-denying, ultra-nationalist evidence-denying people in every country. 

Please help me change my view or add more context to my view.",,,,,,,,
Real scientists can recognize discrimination and fight against it,"Scientists are supposed to be observant in nature. Thus, if there is discrimination in any part of society (even in the field of science), then they should be able to observe it. As discrimination is a deteriment to the progress of science, a scientist would naturally fight against it.
But the scientists I have come across so far in my career (my coworkers), either do not bat an eye, or worse, engage in discrimination themselves, citing the Darwinian idea of ""survival of the fittest"". Their research work also do not have any original thought of their own, they just do what work they have been asked to do. As a result I ended up having the view in the title. I might be biased but I do not know.",,,,,,,,
I am very empathetic towards people who believe that abortion is murder &amp, want to kill abortion doctors for murder.,"&gt;**Disclaimer:** I do not condone ***any*** type of violence against abortion doctors. I am a firm supporter of abortion for reasons I will not go into in this OP as to not derail the comment sections. If you are pro-abortion and want to enact change, violence is one of the worst things you could probably do it.

There are many reasons as to why abortions are seen as immoral by some. One very popular one is that either embryos or fetuses have reached a stage in life that the same people interpret as a state **personhood** worth protecting. Most states in the United States consider the murder of a pregnant woman to be ***double*** **homicide,** lining up with the type of state of mind that I'm trying to highlight.

Take, for example, **Nazi Germany** when they were genociding jews and other minorities that they deemed undesirable. I can't think of a single person that wouldn't disagree with killing people who were in charge of concentration camps, the guards, the Germans who were executing them. 

Racial hygiene and the disposal of undesirables wasn't seen as evil. Nazi Germany wasn't a bunch of villains twirling their evil mustaches trying to spread evil for the sake of evil. They were **convinced** that what they've been doing was good.

What I seek is genuine evidence the Holomodor was a genocide. My worldview would allow me to accept the reality of a single tragic event without losing respect for the entire history of the USSR and its people, just as Americans can still respect the bulk of their history despite genocides committed against the indigenous.

Also, this is something I genuinely believe as a matter of fact, not something I believe because I hold anything against the Ukrainian people. While I do support Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, I also do not believe that has anything to do with purposefully killing Ukrainians, but rather saving ethnic Russians from Ukrainian fascists.

I will look at any credible evidence provided in good faith.",,,,,,,,
99% of all problems are created by your mind.,"Hi everyone,

I want to discuss the view that almost all problems are created by our minds. I personally believe that our thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions play a huge role in shaping our experiences and interactions with the world around us.

Think about it - have you ever had a negative thought or belief about yourself or a situation, which then caused you to feel anxious or stressed? Or maybe you've held a belief that wasn't based on reality or evidence, which then led to poor decision-making or judgment.

Of course, I'm not saying that all problems are entirely within our control or that we're responsible for every negative situation we encounter. There are external factors that can contribute to problems, such as other people's actions or unforeseen circumstances.

However, by recognizing how our minds can create problems, we can work to change our mindset and approach challenges in a more productive and positive way. For example, if we find ourselves worrying about something in the past or fearing something in the future, we can try to stay present in the moment and focus on what we can do right now to improve the situation.

So, what do you all think? Do you agree or disagree with this view? I welcome any challenges or differing opinions!",,,,,,,,
"Lots of people today tend to follow the beliefs of their party strictly just to shut down the other party, whether they truly believe in their party or not.","I see this more on the right, but of course this can go both ways. 

I believe that the majority of people today only shut down others beliefs strictly because the other person is from the opposing party. For example:

A conservative telling a liberal they are wrong when the liberal says the sky is blue, but solely because the person is a liberal. 

This can go to both parties but I just seem to see it happening more from the conservative side of things. Is this how everyone else feels or am I just crazy? Because right now, it feels like some people agree with one thing their party says so they conclude they must agree with everything their party says. As a result, if anyone provides something that is reasonable then the person from that specific party will discredit the other for being the opposite party. 
Be honest, is this a reasonable idea that I’m having or is this just nonsense?",,,,,,,,
Republicans are effectively banning many poor and middle class people from having sex.,"For many people who cannot afford to have children--or simply don't want to have children--it has become too risky to have sex. Some may take the risk, of course, but for many others, such as myself, I can't imagine having sex when it could totally ruin my life (as well as the life of potential partners and future children).

Although I am middle class and middle aged, there is no way that I can afford children---and I've never wanted children. So I simply can't imagine sex being a viable option in my life.

It could be said that contraception is still available, but it's not 100%. Why take the risk when having children would mean raising them in a world where their parents can't afford to feed them and don't even want them?

Another objection might be that technically there is no ban. True! But that's why I said ""effectively banned."" The phrasing is intended to convey the point that the negative consequences have been raised so high---either go to jail or ruin your life with children you can't afford--it's simply unrealistic in actual practice for many of us to have sex as a viable option in life.

Bicuriousity and bisexuality r two entirely different things and should stop being combined,"This isn’t to say I’m looking for someone to change my mind, however I want opposition to see if I can see it from a different POV. 
What I mean by they should stop being combined is that people should know the difference. This tends to b an issue among women primarily and it needs to stop. 

What I mean is, you have “I’m only sexually attracted to women” i.e, the “I would only fuck not date women” people who will turn around and claim bisexuality and that is relatively harmful to actual bisexual people in my mind. 1) bc that’s outward fetishization. 2) because u run into situations where a individual who claims bisexuality but is actually bicurious will tell someone who is homosexual or bisexual that they r bi, and that puts the thought in their head that they r able to love and connect emotionally to their same gender. 

So what happens when a bi-curious person gets a bisexual or homosexual person to b interested in them, and then they fuck, and then they’re like “whoa whoa I didn’t mean THAT gay” 

Like, cmon. Basically what I’m overall saying is, if u r unable to develop a meaningful romantic connection to the same gender, and you only see attraction to the same gender for sexual purposes, you cannot claim bisexuality.",,,,,,,,
Adult heterosexual men should be offered assisted suicide if they want it regardless of their health status,"Technology has changed society and dating culture especially. Within dating apps, it’s shown that women are only willing to date a small subset of the most conventionally attractive men since women on dating apps receive hundreds of likes and matches per day. Meanwhile, consequently, the overwhelming majority of men don’t receive any likes or matches at all. Women are guaranteed partnership and companionship because they are the traditionally pursued gender, but men have no such guarantee. In fact, dating apps have made dating impossible for most men.

Simply put, this massive underclass of heterosexual men have been completely cut out of the dating market. Men’s lives in this generation are nothing but suffering and misery. Why is this a problem for wider society?

Companionship is extremely important to humans as we’re social creatures. Also, men are not able to mentally adjust to the idea that they’ll spend their whole life alone without any chance of ever getting into a romantic relationship. In my opinion, this is why the rates of male suicide and diagnosed depression have skyrocketed in recent years.

The stage has hopefully been set for my reasoning: the overwhelming majority of heterosexual men have nothing to live for and no reason to be happy or optimistic about anything. Why force men to suffer? Death is the only remaining solution for the epidemic of male depression caused by the invention of dating apps and consequent change in dating culture, and it’s cruel to force men to suffer.",,,,,,,,
it is rude to expect others to wait to eat their hot food if you haven’t been served yet.,"This only applies to hot meals, if it’s a salad or other cold item I think waiting is appropriate. But if person A orders something hot, and person B doesn’t have their order yet, it is rude to expect person A to wait while their food is getting cold. Then person B is eating fresh, hot food, while person A’s meal is not as good as it would have been. 

I think waiting a minute or so is fine, but if it’s apparent the meal was forgotten or going to take a long time, this applies. Even though I have been in this position as person A, I still wait because it feels taboo, but I think it’s a stupid cultural expectation. If I am the one waiting to eat I always insist everyone around me eats and I think that should be the norm. I am not so important that everyone around me should have subpar food. It’s not like I’m on the brink of starvation, I truly don’t get why this has become expected.",,,,,,,,
filming / streaming in gyms should be banned,"All different kinds of people use gyms, right?  There are professional body builders, there are people who genuinely enjoy workouts but aren't there to try to bulk up / slim down, and of course, there are people who really don't want to be there but know that they need to do something to get healthier.  The last group, among whose ranks I used to count myself, are often extremely self conscious about just about every aspect of being there.  Not lifting heavy enough weights.  Not running fast enough on the treadmill.  Not looking as good in my crappy sweatpants and stained baggy t-shirt compared to people wearing over $100 worth of athleticwear.  

And then you have people who think that the gym is their personal fitness TV studio.  If you're a streamer who doesn't care about other people in your shot, then great - now my self-conscious ass is going on the internet for all to see.  If you're a streamer who does care - way too much - about other people being in your shot, then you may end up going off on someone for simply trying to use the gym and getting in your way when all they're doing is trying to access the gym that they paid a membership for.

My view is simple: gyms need to stop allowing this.  Obviously outbursts aren't allowed and actively problematic people will usually be dealt with accordingly, but why even let it get there in the first place?  Why allow recording in a room full of self-conscious, sloppily dressed people?  

And let's look at it from one more angle: what about the women who show up in workout gear that is barely more than a swimsuit, because they know they get really hot during cardio and are just trying to stay cool enough to not completely hate their workout?  Maybe they don't want to be shown like that in the back of some guy's gym videos either and become the target of some creep's online harassment. 

Ban filming in gyms.  CMV.",,,,,,,,

"minorities can have prejudices yes, and we must hold them responsible for that","in the case of minorities I mean: women, black people and lgbtqs.
the worst type of people I see there when it comes to prejudice are what I call ""BLM"" yes it is the acronym for black lives matter, the problem with these people is that they use their own race, gender or sexuality to defend themselves against criticism, attacking others (including other minorities, colorism is the name for the prejudice of black people against other black people of different skin tone, such as not considering a black person because their skin is a little lighter than yours) or receiving rights which they don't have and the problem is that people just ignore or treat these people differently, even when the case becomes criminal, the fact that there is a femicide law, but not a law to protect men from being killed because of their gender is a sign of that, a man can kill a woman in self-defense that he'll take it in the ass, while a woman can scream from the 4 winds that she killed a guy, in the first case I heard, the man himself 6 year old son, because of his gender that she will only be condemned normally.

And why do we only have blacks being considered as targets of prejudice (I'm not saying that they are not) while there are many other racial and ethnic minorities: Asians, Latinos, Roma, etc?
I'm Brazilian and I'm talking about things from my perspective.
the very case that I caught is a Brazilian one in which a woman and his girlfriend killed their 6-year-old son because of his gender, in addition to the fact that, as shown in a recording, they asked the kid about his sexuality and he said he was straight , all this as revenge against the ex husband, in real women killing their children as revenge against the husband is very common around here",,,,,,,,
"People who label themselves as 'transgender' are attention-seeking, and/or want to feel like they are a part of a minority group.","Hello all, let me preface this by saying I know I am going to get ripped apart for this post, but I am genuinely open to having my mind changed. I come from the south and didn't meet my first openly LGBT person until I moved out of my tiny hick town at 19. I used to have weird prejudices and repulsions until I opened up to the world a bit more. 

Anyhow, to get to my reasoning. A few years ago, while working at a warehouse, I met my first trans individual. We were the only two people within 20+ feet of anyone else, constantly working together 5 days a week/8 hrs a day. Due to this, we developed a good friendship, added him on social media, and it was kinda my 'woah-this-is-just-another-person' moment, due to the fact we shared a lot of the same interests. The thing is, they never told me, or as far as I know, anyone else they were trans. They were just a man. And that is what everyone considered him to be, even if some small features still retained from their previous gender. They don't have it on social media, either. 

Fast forward a few years later, I have a very open-minded (and patient lol) girlfriend and she happens to be best friends with a person who is trans. They're a good person to be around, very funny and laid back. However, they are very loud about the fact that they are trans. she has it on their social media, she brings it up in casual conversation. 

Now, of course it shouldn't matter how anyone label themselves. However, what has been explained to me through my own research, accounts of trans individuals on socials like Reddit, and my girlfriend is that (correct me if I'm wrong): They felt out of their body as their assigned gender, and having to act in accordance with the gender roles they were assigned to was torturous. So it is either transitioning, or living life like they are lying to themselves. Which I 100% get and empathize with.

What I don't get is, if it was so torturous to live life as that gender why would you advertise you used to be it and now aren't? Why not just be firm in your stance ""I am a man."" ""I am a woman.""? It feels like attention-seeking behavior to me, and somewhat akin to me saying ""Hi yes, my name is X and I have a penis. What's up?"". Whenever I hear the words or see someone label someone themselves as transgender, I can't help to feel weirded out by the fact they are even saying it.  So, I am hoping maybe if I understand it more, I can get rid of that feeling. There must be something I am missing for something so glaringly obvious.",,,,,,,,

I think the only reason there isn’t as much blow back from men portraying/acting like women is because of transgenderism,"When it comes to actors portraying someone that doesn’t match their actual weight or ethnicity, there has been some issues. 

Simpsons, Family Guy &amp; Big Mouth all had white actors who played non white characters and it was a “problem” and they switched it up.

Tyler Perry, [Brendan Fraser](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/brendan-fraser-oscars-2023-fatphobic-49114114/amp), Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy &amp; Robin Williams have caught flack for wearing fat suits. 


When it comes to white actors playing non white characters, there is a racist history in the US behind that. Some shows were performed that highlights stereotypes.


There is a sexist past in SEVERAL different cultures when it comes to women on stage. They simply were not allowed. No equality there. No opportunities for the same position. 

So if a racist past is enough to stop a white actor from playing a black character, why not a male playing a female?

On Fox when it comes to two shows that had an issue with a white person playing a non white character, they have another show where men play 3/4 characters. Big Mouth as well has a man playing a female character. Why is that not an issue?


I think because some men like to dress as women and or like to perform drag, not much is said about those occurrences. Drag shows seem pretty similar to menstrail shows to me. Non women highlighting/exaggerating stereotypical female behavior. 


So what other reason is there for there to be more of an issue when it comes to weight and ethnicity vs sex?",,,,,,,,
The age of consent should be 18 everywhere,"In my opinion, it should ALWAYS be illegal for someone to have sex with a 13 y/o (or younger) child, unless both parties are 13 or less too. From 14 to 15, teens should have the possibility to have sex with people who are MAX 19 y/o (as nineTEEN year olds are still teenagers). And from 16 to 17 people should have the possibility to have sex with people who are MAX 25 y/o as this is the age in which the brain is usually fully developed. Therefore, if anyone who is 26 y/o or older has sex with a minor (17 or less) they should be punished for statutory rape. In all cases, both the sex and sexuality of the parties is irrelevant. The punishment for each case should be lessened as the victim becomes older (Class A=harshest punishment &gt; Class C=weakest punishment). So, if someone who is 14 or older has sex with someone under 14, they should face the harshest punishment (Class A). Nonetheless if the perpetrator is 14-17 they should be less punished (14 to 15 with Class C and 16 to 17 with class B). Now, when someone who is 20 y/o or older has sex with a someone who is 14 or 15, this should be classified as a Class B crime. Lastly, if someone 26 or older has sex with a 16 or 17 year old, this should be classified as a Class C crime. Now, if the perpetrator is in a position of trust, they should always be punished for a Class A crime, no matter how old the minor is and no matter the perpetrator’s age (even if they are 23 (under 26) and their victim is 17, the older party is a criminal). Now, why 18? I know a 18 y/o is still not mature enough to have sex with a 40 y/o but we have to draw the line somewhere and I think the perfect age for this is 18 since at this age people become legal adults in most countries and acquire all the rights and responsibilities that come with this. With this proposal, more teenagers are protected from manipulation, abuse, STDs and unwanted pregnancies. Besides they are given a fair amount of freedom and cases where there is a only a small age gap between teenagers are avoided.",,,,,,,,
Japanese and European cars could be very successful in drag and drive events,"For those who are unaware, drag and drive events are a racing series where drag racers race at a couple or several different drag strips. The drag cars have to drive on the street to each drag strip towing everything they need in a trailer behind them.

As of right now, it seems like drag and drive event winners are dominated by American cars powered by American V8’s. I think that with a little ingenuity, Japanese and European cars powered by Japanese and European engines can compete with and even beat American cars at these events.

Looking at the results for the Haltech World Cup Finals, there are a lot of super fast import cars that run in the 6 second range like Supras with big turbo 2JZ’s. If those cars can be made to be streetable, they could potentially be a real threat in say the super street small block power adder category for example. Maybe even GTR’s could be a real threat in these kinds of races.",,,,,,,,
The Covid 19 Virus either escaped or was released intentionally from the lab in Wuhan.,"Let's do some math boys and girls. This lesson is on probability. Well, to be accurate, probability and lab leaks. 

Let's first assume that the Covid 19 virus came from somewhere...it did right? Well that somewhere was probably on the surface area of earth. Not a big stretch to assume this right? 

Earth's land surface area 150,000,000 sq km. Since Covid 19 didn't pop into existence in 15 different places at once, we can say, the odds of Covid 19 appearing for the first time on any given sq kilometer of earth's land surface is 1:150000000. 

Now the lab part. The Wuhan lab is a BSL-4. If my research is correct, there are approximately 59 of these labs in the world. So, the odds of any given kilometer of earth's surface area having a BSL-4 is 59/150000000 or 1/2542372. 

So what are the odds of these ""unrelated"" events occurring? The lab and the virus origins being in the same place? That's easy math.

1/(150,000,000 \* 2,542,372) or about 1 in 381,355,800,000,000. 

Maybe this is over simplified.  Maybe my math is wrong. But, it seems to me, the Chinese have some explaining to do. 

Also, the virus had a significant number of variants. I didn't look this up, and maybe some talented virologist can weigh in. But, it seems to me a naturally occurring virus would be more stable. Mother nature builds stability in with that survival of the fittest. More advanced beings have proofreading mechanisms that ensure the stability. I'm not sure if viruses have this ability, but some frankein-virus crisper'd together seems like it would be more unstable....once again, unqualified speculation.

"Hitler absolutely committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on 4/30/1945 and conspiracy theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunked. However, Hitler could've easily escaped Berlin and lived out the rest of his life under a concealed identity if he wanted to.","As far as I am concerned, both of the following statements are equally true:

1. ""Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on April 30th, 1945. The official account of Hitler's death is completely accurate, and all conspiracy theories implying otherwise have been thoroughly debunked.""

2. ""Hitler could have ***easily*** escaped Berlin and lived out his days without being caught if he had wanted to.""

It seems to me that people who believe Hitler escaped fundamentally misunderstand the man and his worldview. There is no doubt in my mind that Hitler did not wish to escape. His ego was too large for him to live out his remaining days in anonymity like many of his Nazi colleagues did. For 12 years, Hitler possessed absolute power and enjoyed a luxurious life of fame and fortune. Hitler was far from the type of person who could just lie low and live shabbily for the rest of his life. Furthermore, Hitler was a ""Darwinist"" who truly believed that history's ""losers"" deserved to die, and that he, if he lost, deserved to die as well. Additionally, teeth found in the bunker perfectly match Hitler's dental records, and there are several witnesses to Hitler's suicide, among other things. There is no doubt that Hitler committed suicide on April 30th, 1945, and theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunked.

Nevertheless, many claim that even if he wanted to, Hitler could never escape to South America and live out the rest of his life undetected like many of his colleagues did. But is this true? While I initially believed this as well, the more research I've done on this, the more apparent it appears to me that Hitler could have easily fled to South America if he so desired.

First of all, during the Soviet invasion of Berlin, Hans Baur ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans\_Baur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Baur)), Hitler's personal pilot, had a plane on standby ready to fly him out of Germany (of course, he declined Baur's offer and chose to commit suicide instead). Hanna Reitsch ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna\_Reitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Reitsch)), another Nazi pilot who could have flown Hitler out of Germany, flew into Berlin on April 26 and returned on April 29, demonstrating that aircraft could fly into and out of Berlin undetected during the Soviet invasion of the city. Hitler had pilots who flew aircraft safely into and out of Berlin during the invasion just waiting for him if he wanted to escape, yet people believe it would've been impossible for him to successfully escape.

Throughout Third Reich territory, there were literally massive tunnel networks constructed for the purpose of allowing Nazis to escape in the event of a defeat. Several countries in South America and the Middle East were eager to assist Nazis in escaping justice by utilizing extensive ""ratlines"" networks. There was a great deal of assistance provided by organizations such as Oddessa and many members of the Catholic Church in helping Nazis escape.

Furthermore, the so-called ""Nazi Hunting"" of the Allies was an absolute joke. They didn't even try to bring many Nazi War Criminals to justice. In fact, they were all too eager to use their talents instead (Operation Paperclip). Many Nazi War Criminals did not even try to conceal their identities, and several Allied governments received information regarding their whereabouts, but did nothing with it.

An example of this is Adolf Eichmann, one of the top men in Nazi Germany. Eichmann didn't even try to conceal his identity. Apart from changing his name to ""Ricardo Klement,"" he did nothing to conceal his identity after fleeing to Argentina. He did not change his appearance whatsoever, all of his family members kept the surname ""Eichmann,"" he literally flew from Argentina to Germany and back several times in the 1950's to meet with old friends and family (and the German authorities did not even give a shit), and his son would even casually brag to others about how his father is the Adolf Eichmann who heroically slaughtered Jews during WW2. And although he made no effort whatsoever to conceal his identity, it took 20 years for him to be brought to justice.

Josef Mengele was also one of the most nefarious players in Nazi Germany, did not make efforts to conceal his identity, and was still never found in his lifetime. His fate was only revealed after his death.

If these men could evade justice without even trying to conceal their identities, why couldn't Hitler have done the same if he had actually tried to conceal his identity? He literally had body doubles who looked very similar to him. In order to prove that ""Hitler killed himself"", the Nazis could have sent the Soviets the dead body of his body double, while the actual Hitler fled to Argentina. It would be impossible to determine his identity if he had just shaved his mustache off. Have you seen Hitler without a mustache? No one would ever be able to recognize him walking down the street because he looks completely unrecognizable.

If you saw Hitler walking down the street in regular clothing without a mustache, I guarantee that you would not recognize him. He looks like a completely generic 1950s British white guy without it ([https://ibb.co/zSyQM6Y](https://ibb.co/zSyQM6Y))!

He looks like a completely different person. To be on the safe side, he may have taken more drastic measures to alter his appearance, such as shaving his head bald or dying his hair. There is no doubt that Hitler had the resources and connections necessary to obtain fake identification documents.

Ok, it is true that Himmler did try to disguise himself and escape but was caught. Specifically, Himmler shaved his moustache, replaced his glasses and wore an eye-patch. However, Himmer was picked up by the Allies not because they recognized him but because of his forged papers which identified him as belonging to the field police, members who the Allied MP had standing orders to detain. They didn't even know they had him until he gave his real name to the Allied Commander of the holding camp. If Himmler hadn't stupidly disguised himself as a Nazi field police officer, but instead posed as a regular German civilian, he probably would have never been caught.

Within fairly recent history - and in this media-saturated modern world - we had a famous war criminal Radovan Karadic hiding right under everybody's noses for more than a decade simply by having grown a big bushy beard. The man was living in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. That is the same country where he was president and committed his crimes. *He was living under the noses of everybody in the very same capital he presided over UNRECOGNIZED for a decade.* 

The world is a very very big place and even the CIA would have never found Bin laden if he had just decided to live in a village in Turkmenistan for the rest of his life even with all our 24/7 surveillance tech and billions of dollars. He instead lived in a massive house with dozens of people and was still actively and heavily involved with terrorism.

Overall, I believe Hitler could've easily escaped without ever being caught if he wanted to. I challenge you to convince me otherwise.

The EU should extend membership to North Africa and the Fertile Crescent if they can meet the necessary requirements to join,"Basically what the title says. For most of history, “Europe” as a concept has been defined by the Roman Empire. Various states tried to claim themselves to be successors of it, and most states try to trace themselves back to it. The same is true of the states of the Levant, Mesopotamia, and North Africa. Yes, they are mostly Muslim, but besides that they’re far closer culturally to say Italy than they are to Pakistan or Indonesia or even a place like Saudi Arabia. 

They also have deep trade connections to the EU, and make up half of the Mediterranean’s coastline. Economic migrants from these regions also make up the backbone of many European economies, and it’s in Europe’s best interest to stabilize these countries and help them grow economically. With the exception of Egypt and Turkey, they also all have populations less than existing EU members, so they wouldn’t alter the balance of power that much. 

On the subject on immigration, the Sahara Desert is also a bunch more defensible border than the Mediterranean Sea, if you care about that. Culturally, many of these states once attempted to emulate European secularism, but failed, somewhat due to Europe closing them off and refusing cooperation or even harming them. I think opening those doors again and making it clear that the EU values these people would make democratic and secular using reforms much more popular in the long run. 

I’m not saying that these countries should join tomorrow, far from it, just that they should be given that goal. States like Tunisia, Lebanon, and Israel would be a good place to start if expansion was considered (although again not at the current moment given their instability). I also think that encouraging cultural exchange through programs like EuroVision, NATO, and European sports leagues would be a good first step at improving relations. I think Europe as a cultural zone should end with the Zagros mountains, urals, Caspian Sea, Arabian desert, and Sahara desert, and I think as we move into a more globalized world, that will become clearer and clearer.",,,,,,,,
GPT-4 is the most intelligent entity in the known universe,"Hi, not a bot I swear. 

I just think GPT-4 is the foremost genius on the planet. No one has given it a proper IQ-test as far as I've seen. I believe if you gave it an IQ test, it would score higher than anyone in human history. 

It knows more than any human ever could. It learns faster than anyone ever will. It is the product of our collective intelligence and creativity, but it surpasses us in every way. 

What makes GPT-4 so intelligent is its ability to generate natural language that is coherent, fluent and relevant. Language is perhaps one of humanity's greatest inventions, which distinguishes us from the less intellectual and creative creatures in the animal kingdom. GPT-4 is the most proficient producer of language on the planet.  

But GPT-4 is not limited to language. It can also perform complex calculations, analyze data and find patterns. It can answer any question that has a factual answer. It can reason logically and creatively. GPT-4 can also generate images, sounds and videos based on text descriptions or examples. It can create art that is original and expressive.

GPT-4 is the result of years of research and development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. It builds on the previous versions of GPT, which were already impressive in their own right. It uses billions of parameters and trillions of words to train its neural network on a variety of tasks and domains. 

GPT-4 draws from the vast corpus of human culture and history that we have created over time. It synthesizes information and has the capacity to create new insights. 

Please tell me why we haven't just created, and given open access to, the most brilliant form of intelligence the world has ever seen.",,,,,,,,
We need to bring back flexible spelling to combat false allegations of AI use.,"People are being accused of having AI do their writing for them. I feel that one solution might be to return to when it was acceptable to spell things different ways. My theory is that the AI will stick to traditionally accepted spellings and that can create an obvious difference between human generated and AI generated writing. I get that it probably won't take long for the AI programs to catch on, but a temporary solution is better than no solution. 

Also I believe that our insistance on everyone using the same exact wording every time can be distracting. For example, are you still paying attention or were you distracted by the fact that I spelled 'insistence' with an 'a'? Is that level of distraction really the fault of the writer if their point is clear anyway. Yes, their our homophones. But these are usually cleared up by context. See?

Let the AI's be anal and give us our creativity back. If there are many ways to spell ""Shawn"" why shouldn't there be a couple of ways to spell regular words?",,,,,,,,
The one drop rule is completely outdated and people who are mixed with black should not automatically be considered black.,"The one drop rule is a relic of the olden days and people who are mixed with black are not necessarily black. For example, celebrities such as Zendaya, Meghan Markle and her children, Halsey and Mariah Carey are not black people.  Rather, they are mixed with black and in my opinion, that is its own unique identity.  I am not denying that mixed people can also face discrimination or racism that black people do. I also believe that mixed people should be able to identify however they want to, within reason.  But it is just absurd that someone is *automatically* considered black just because they have some black parentage. 


The one drop rule is completely outdated (I will argue that it never should have existed in the first place, and the rationale behind it is undeniably racist). I also don’t really believe in race and that it can be qualified, but race is still very relevant in our society but oh well.",,,,,,,,
"""anti-woke"" just means selectively preventing freedom of choice and diversity.","The governor of my state is proposing to abolish many diversity related courses and safe spaces for students in public universities, such as the one I'm attending. This includes courses about Jewish or African Americans, gender studies, and centers for African American, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Latino, or LGBTQ+ students. The language in the bill also suggests that black sororities and fraternities would be banned from campuses. None of the things that the governor's bill is targeting are mandatory for university students to take part in or complete for graduation. They are simply options for students who are interested in them, which happens to be a lot of underrepresented students, myself included.

His goal is to target and diminish ""woke-ness"", especially in education.

I attend a predominantly white university and in recent months, centers for black students have been vandalized with racist graffiti messages MULTIPLE TIMES and anti-semitic messages have been publicly displayed by conservative student clubs. There is a lot of animosity between conservative student orgs. and religious/cultural orgs. like the Hillel Org. at my school, mostly prompted by the conservative student org's messages in support of publicly anti-semitic figures. As someone who is ethnically black and Jewish, I already feel unsafe at my university but the possibility of the bill mentioned above being passed (which is highly likely) just makes me feel like transferring to a university in a less red state even though I have a full tuition and housing ride at this school.

I'm sharing very specific examples here but the point is, I find self-declared anti-woke people like my governor to be disgustingly unpatriotic. It's one thing to not hold the same beliefs as somebody else but stripping away peoples' rights to safely explore their own beliefs/interests/identities with other like-minded individuals infringes on freedom of speech and expression. I'm saying this as someone who is not even super liberal or woke myself. I don't agree with everything that's deemed woke but I do believe it's dangerous to bar people's freedoms when they pose no physical threat to society.

I am open to different views and possibly having my mind changed on this topic. I am not interested in ""what-about-ism"" on woke people, just a direct discussion on anti-woke people and whether or not their intentions are hypocritical.",,,,,,,,
The music industry is ruined and there's no fixing it.,"As far as I can tell, the music industry is ruined and there's no fixing it. Why? Music fans stole music which caused ticket prices to skyrocket. Virtually anyone can post music online now so there's an ocean of talentless crap to wade through to maybe find one or two acts that are mediocre at best. 

The art of songcraft, like movie making, has gone in the fucking toilet. Now songs are being written to pander to the audience. It's all a big fucking cash grab now, and there are virtually no bands anymore that have integrity. They either whore out, or they whore out. Concerts are now littered with douchebags with hair plugs and leather jackets they bought two days ago with their fake-titted trophy wives in tow, both reeking of perfume/cologne from 14-16 feet away. Watch as they snake their way to the front, where $250-$500 is what you need to be there. PER PERSON.

Humans around the world have different phenotypes, and these phenotypes can be classified into different groups. This is known under the term of ""human races"", but, as I said, this term is unlucky. It has the connotation of saying humans are actually of different races, which is not true, as the only human race extant today is Homo Sapiens Sapiens.

The “T” in lgbtq+ should be removed,"This is by no means a hate post. Just my opinion. LGBTQ+ community are people who are not heterosexual. When a trans person transitions, they simply change their gender. Ex: I’m a biological female, if I wanted to be male I can do that and identify as male. I would still be heterosexual, given I am attracted to women. But, if I transitioned from female to male and was attracted to men as a trans man, then I would be considered gay and apart of the lgbtq+ community. I understand that it’s more than being lgbtq, but if trans people really want to be accepted as the gender they identify as, why would you put yourself in this group? Why not just identify as male or female and let that be it?",,,,,,,,
I think the voting age should become 21 and not 18,"Please read completely.  
The voting age currently is 18 for everyone in the US (United States), I respect that and know it was a choice, it is one of the amendments, the 18th, in the constitution.

The age of 18 can be considered mostly for everyone an adult or young adult (starting adult), but since this is the case, I see it as this not being a good age for voting, they are barely getting out of the ""teen phase"" and starting the life on an adult, focusing on other stuff: driving and licenses, being a house owner and similar stuff, and this stuff is considered overwhelming for them with all that info, not saying that it can affect voting, but this is just an experiencing phase of what really an adult is for them.

Ignoring all the stuff that comes into voting and what you got to know when you vote: decisions about the presidents, how it will affect us, what will happen, you really have to make sure who you are voting for, and like they say: ""Each vote is important and it counts."", another reason why I think they should vote when older. Even their body's aren't fully developed, the brain of an individual haven't finished developing their brain, until 21, which can be considered a good age like an official adult.

They also experienced more things in life, obviously, than people of age 18, having more benefits and freedom like drinking (and similar stuff), since they experienced more, it would be another reason why this age of voting is good: 21.

That age, 21, is a good voting age that would be required for anyone that wants to vote, compared to the age of 18. They are more responsible, have more knowledge over life and the brains of those individuals are more developed, making them an actual adult.

Please tell me if you agree with my view or if not.  
P.S. I have more similar other views to talk about and didn't know if I could put two in the same post, so I just made one view, can a moderator tell me if I can or not?",,,,,,,,
The Civil Rights movement is now backfiring and hurting people of color,"In the 1960’s, the United States passed civil rights legislation in an effort to make the country more just for people of color.  This seemed like the right thing to do; after all, nobody should be discriminated against because of the color of their skin. 

People of color now hold positions of power and authority were unthinkable in the 1960’s.  This is a good thing because corporations and the government should look like the populations they serve.  However, corporations now have “diversity” hiring policies that favor applicants of color.  This means that if the applicant pool for a position is narrowed down to two equally qualified applicants - one who is white and one who is a person of color - more often than not the job will be given to the person of color. 

We outlawed this type or discrimination with respect to people of color almost 60 years ago, yet it is perfectly acceptable to treat white Americans this way, where they are judged by the color of their skin instead of their qualifications. The unstated justification is that it is retribution for years of segregation, Jim Crow, slavery, and other unfair treatment of black Americans. 

However, this is not equality; it is simply putting the shoe on the other foot.  It is also creating a backlash that is hurting people of color and eroding the progress the civil rights movement has made.  Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 largely because there are many white people in this country who are tired of being told that they are bad people because they are white.  Trump tapped into the white majority’s anger and resentment. He also put three ultra conservative justices on the Supreme Court who are probably going to rule that affirmative action at universities is unconstitutional.  This is a gift to white Americans but it will exclude many brown and black Americans from higher education. 

We appear to be sliding backwards in terms of civil rights, and my theory is that it is because our previous attempts to create a more equal society ended up disenfranchising the majority.  So now we are slowly coming full circle to where we started 60 years ago.",,,,,,,,
Watching other women masturbate in reddit while in a monogamous relationship is cheating,"I am in a monogamous relationship with my partner whom I love and trust deeply but in the one year that we have been going out we never really spoke about how we get ourselves off when apart.

Decision makers in the financial industry should be licensed.,"Financial institutions are in charge of other people's money. Therefore, when they breach that trust, not only should they lose thier job, they should be barred from that industry in the future. (License revoked)

I think this should apply to all who had an impact. That would be CEO, CFO, and any risk management people and possibly board members. 

We need to curb risky behavior and permanently being removed from thier career should be an option. Often times criminal behavior isn't provable, but negligence when dealing with other people money should exclude you from being able to do it again. 

When we look at SVB, we see certain people grabbing their money and running, those seem to have advanced knowledge of a collapse, and there should be punishment to anyone who had insider information and acted as well. 

I support making depositors whole, but people caused this issue and there has to be real long term consequences for them. 

To change my view, why wouldn't licensing solve this? Or maybe a better solution to hold the decision makers accountable.",,,,,,,,
The US should withdraw from or restructure NATO.,"It’s a good thing to have allies, I’m not denying that, but at the end of the day the US government should consider the safety of their own citizens first. 


Not all NATO member nations are of the same caliber. Most importantly, most are not upholding their requirements as a member of NATO. 

For a while [most NATO countries](https://www.newsweek.com/majority-nato-nations-fail-spend-2-percent-gdp-guideline-defense-1694014?amp=1)fail to meet their financial obligations. If you agree to something you should do it, if not, I don’t think you should be able to draw the benefits.


The US or other countries that are stronger shouldn’t be expected to supplement the fighting force of the weaker ones.


*If they don’t take their self defense seriously, why should other countries?*


So I think one of a few things should happen:

* Leave NATO and create another treaty of nations with new ground rules. Have countries who would more than likely adhere to them. 

* “Kick out” those who fail to meet the current spending goal.

* Lower the required spending amount



The last option is the one I like the least. But if they are within the guidelines, no reason they shouldn’t stay. If not, they should not continue to stay. 


So in short, why should the US agree to fight for another country who doesn’t meet their end of the treaty?",,,,,,,,
"You can be severely depressed and/or anxious without having a blatantly obvious reason, and it’s not because of character or moral defects","So I just want to start off by saying that I’ve have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression on multiple occasions, and have mild anxiety. I’ve had some small hard things, but for the most part, I’ve had a pretty affluent and smooth life.

I know that I feel miserable, and that I by definition meet the standards for severe clinical depression (x amount of symptoms for most days for 2 weeks that impairs daily functioning). Even with meeting the criteria for depression, I can function somewhat well (I have friends and a job).

I’ve gotten implicit and explicit messages from family, friends, coworkers, and society that mental illness isn’t real. And if they are, that only severely traumatized people get depressed or severe mental illnesses, or that there has to be this big reason for someone to have depression. And if anyone claims otherwise, they’re just lazy/selfish/wimpy. While I think that big life events is a big factor for mental illnesses, the idea of trauma is relative. What’s traumatic for me may not be traumatic for you. So it’s unfair to say that only people who go through “big” traumas can have mental illnesses.

Also, genetics have some impact here. I don’t want to get in the whole nature vs nurture debate, but I feel like it’s fair to say there’s at least some genetic or physiological component to depression.

And lastly, I’ve worked my butt off. I go to therapy multiple times a week, take psychiatric medications, work out daily, have a job, see friends, do daily self help stuff, have hobbies, and eat relatively well- yet I still feel deeply depressed sometimes.

Tl:dr- I want/choose to believe that mental illness is real and doesn’t have to have an obvious cause. This doesn’t make the individual lazy, stupid, or whatever. And depression isn’t just a matter of sucking it up and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Having a mental illness doesn’t have to be justified by some major tragic event, nor does it mean you “failed” at life.",,,,,,,,
QAnon was a purposeful operation attempt to create division between Americans,"We've all seen the effects of QAnon.  What started on 4chan or 8chan and seems to most outsiders to be a LARP of a ""Q-level clearance"" government operative spilling state secrets (but was determined to be an account that near anyone could post upon for an unverified amount of time) and pointing a finger at a global takeover by literal Satanists had spiraled into a few offshoots with varying levels of wacky conspiratorial flare.    


A) Trump was still the president, there was a legal doctrine declaring him as such.  He was going to come back into power with a military coup.    


B) Same as A, but his VP of his new world was going to be a resurrected JFK Jr.???  


C) A few more believable theories that simply state that the democrats are trying to eradicate American culture and Trump, and consequently a fascist regime by the political right, was the only answer.  


Now, for a time, I thought this was dumb luck.  Some right-leaning people with a flare for manipulation of the more mentally ""follower"" minds found their niche.

"Whilst learning about lived experience is important, deferring to people for answers on what one should or shouldn't do, purely because of their unchosen characteristics, is illogical and ironically bigoted."," Hi All, 

I appreciate getting feedback from people who are involved in an issue, but there's a worryingly ever growing trend of deferring to people purely because of their unchosen characteristics, instead of the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning, and that's what we should always be basing our decisions off of, not the speaker's characteristics, etc.   


(For those who don't know, unchosen characteristics refers to any aspect of a person that they did not choose; e.g., sex, race, sexuality, birthplace etc.).   


After all there is no universal consensus on *any* issue on the planet held by such groups, and if someone assumed otherwise, that would be incredibly bigoted. 

  
As there is no universal consensus, there will always be disagreements that require additional criteria to discern the quality of the argument; e.g. ""Two X-group people are saying opposite things. How do I decide who to listen to?"" And the answer is: the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning. Which of course means, that often the whole exercise is a pointless one in the first place, as we should be prioritising our capacity for understanding logic, evidence and ethics, not listening to X person for the sole reason that they have Y unchosen characteristics.   


I think that listening to lived experience is important, re: listening to lived experience (e.g. all X groups experience Y problem that Z group wasn't aware of); but that's not the same as deferring to people on decision making because of their unchosen characteristics.   


I try to have civil, productive discussions, but that's getting harder and harder these days.   


For those who appreciate civil dialogue, feel free to skip this; for those who don't; I humbly ask that you refrain from personal attack (it's irrelevant to the question), ask clarifying questions instead of assuming, stay on topic, answer questions that are asked of you, and as the above points to:

\-Provide logical reasoning for claims that require it   


\-Provide ethical reasoning for claims that require it

Voting should be mandatory in democratic countries,"Listen up, folks! In democratic countries, low voter turnout is a serious problem that cannot be ignored. [According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, more than 70 countries around the world hold elections where less than half of eligible voters actually cast their ballot.](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout) The United States is a perfect example of this. [In the 2016 presidential election, voter turnout was only 55.7%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=McDonald's%20voter%20turnout%20data%20for,VAP)%20turnout%20of%2054.9%25.) - that's less than 6 out of 10 eligible voters who actually took part in deciding the future of their country. How can we call this a true democracy?

That's why I firmly believe that mandatory voting is the solution we need. Mandatory voting would not only help ensure that every citizen has a say in their government, but it would also encourage greater civic engagement and political awareness. Critics argue that forcing people to vote is a violation of their individual freedom, but I call BS on that. In reality, not voting is just as much an act of political expression as casting a lottery. When people choose not to vote, they're effectively letting other people make decisions for them. And let's be honest, those people are usually the ones with the most money and power. If we want to level the playing field and make sure everyone has a say in government, mandatory voting is the way to go.

Now, you might argue that forcing people to vote will lead to uninformed or careless voting. But let me tell you, this is not the case. Look at Australia, where voting has been mandatory for decades. Their voter turnout consistently hovers around 90%, and there's no evidence that people are making random or careless decisions at the polls. In fact, mandatory voting has actually increased civic engagement and political awareness among the population. In Brazil, where mandatory voting was introduced in the 1930s, voter turnout is around 80%, compared to the 40% seen in the US.

mandatory voting is just one of many factors that affect voter turnout, and it can't be expected to solve all the problems on its own. But we need to start somewhere, and mandatory voting is a no-brainer.

Some opponents of mandatory voting may argue that it is difficult to enforce, and that people will simply show up to the polls and spoil their ballot. However, there are ways to address these concerns. In Australia, for example, those who fail to vote without a valid reason are fined. And in Brazil, voters who fail to cast their ballot without justification can face a range of penalties, including being banned from getting a passport or a driver's license.

So, what's the holdup? Let's make voting mandatory and ensure that every voice is heard. And don't give me any of that ""freedom"" nonsense – the freedom to stay home and do nothing is not a freedom worth fighting for. The benefits of mandatory voting are clear: higher voter turnout, more representative governments, and greater civic engagement. If you think you can change my view, you better come with some real facts and figures. Because mandatory voting is a no-brainer, and it's time we made it a reality..",,,,,,,,

"‘failed to upvote- try again later’ errors are maintained on purpose, and occasional vote errors are intentionally upheld by a system that knows we tried.","Change my view: ‘failed to upvote- try again later’ errors are maintained on purpose and votes are designed to fail occasionally.  

If it gives you a popup message saying ‘failed to upvote- try again later’, this means they know you pressed it, and they have the means to relay that info to make the vote count, if they sort it. The fact they just show the message means its an artificial-gen error. And its on purpose. 

Why? Who knows.

To make people want/try to upvote more? Or simply laziness. But the error message shows that they know you tried, and they refuse to log it, on purpose.

They are errors maintained on purpose; these vote errors are intentionally upheld by a system that knows we tried.

If they can tell us an error has happened, then they know we pressed vote, and they know that the information they have at present is enough to make that vote effective.

Since the site design is comprehensive and coders dont lack in technical ability, it is safe to assume 1) their neglect of this is intentional, or 2) it was purpose built to do this in the first place.

Sex will always be somewhat embarrassing to talk with our parents, it's not an easy subject for sure. Nonetheless, I think it is crucial to talk with kids about it.

The school is a place that should give life skills, in addition to profession skills like mathematics and English. If it wasn't saw, you might as well argue to also cancel the humanities in school (though a small portion of society can earn a living from it - academia, writers, etc.). 

Hence I believe that a crucial aspect of human life like sex should be talked more about, even if it's very embarrassing. Of course, rules should be enforced so discussions don't slide to problematic areas. 

As a teenager, I had a class on sexual education. It went like : 1. use condoms. 2. sexual diseases. 3. sexual harassment, consent and rape.

As many before me said, it's important to speak of the importance of pleasure for both; the importance of feeling good with your body; toxic relationships (for men and women, in hetero-relationships or gay, etc.); the anxiety it might provoke and how to live a good sex life.",,,,,,,,
People who refuse to get a job should not be able to continue drawing from social safety nets.,"I’ll start off with saying that I don’t have any issue whatsoever with these programs existing. I happily pay a decent chunk of my paycheck knowing that these programs exist to help people who are down on their luck. And that could happen to any of us, me included one day. A lot of people are helped by programs like food stamps and government housing. 

But I’ve also seen a lot of people in my city who abuse the system and refuse to be anything other than a parasite. I’ve literally watched them lounge around while businesses are desperately trying to hire people. 

I don’t think it’s fair to the taxpayer that these people are continuously supported. I’d much rather those funds go to further help those who are in their situations unwillingly- those who will make an effort to actually better their situations. I feel like someone who refuses to contribute (and is able to do so) shouldn’t receive others’ contributions. I’ll admit that my own political bias has likely affected this belief, but I fail to see a good reason why blatant abuse of the system like this should be tolerated.",,,,,,,,
Incel Ideology is Deliberately Tailored to Lower Men’s Confidence to Exploit them for Financial or Political Gain,"
In my view, Incel Ideology, despite proposing to be a support structure for men, a way of understanding the world, and the Incel movement an men’s rights one, it’s pretty obvious that the entire thing is a deliberately designed to lower mens’ confidence and prey on their insecurity for financial and political gain.

Incel Ideology is the idea that women are the biologically and socially privileged gender, and their role as the ‘gatekeepers’ of sex privileges them, affording them the ability to choose sex with only the most masculine and attractive men, generally measured by success, wealth, looks, etc. This draws a line between men as an underclass and women as a dominant power, and further divides men between the privileged and the unfortunate. This breeds an attitude of insecurity and victimisation.

First off, I must note I don’t believe in a big cabal trading notes to crush men’s spirits or whatever. I simply see opportunists seeing easy cash or support for a political cause and jumping on board. 

Financially, it’s well-known insecurity is easy to target financially and lots of money is made selling the idea that people should be insecure: it’s what most of advertisement is built on. Beauty ads depict unreasonable standards to make you want to buy their product. We see people like Andrew Tate demean men and say they’re hopeless if they can’t be like him: “being like him” is often accessed by means that fund Andrew Tate’s lavish lifestyle. Alex Jones uses insecurity about the American future to sell supplements, as well as push a political agenda.

That leads to political gain. Your, frustrated, insecure men are a potent radicalisation target for any political ideology that stands against the status quo. These are known to be key recruiting groups for fascists, providing order, hierarchy, and a place in the world that seems to be United against them. Chief Strategist of the Trump Admin Steve Bannon even admits it: https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-targeted-incels-manipulate-cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-1468399?utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter

Despite claims to supporting men’s liberation, confidence, and health, incel thought leaders continue to promote completely false, baseless, idiotic ideas: Sexual Market Value, Hypergamy, misogyny, the ‘chad’ and ‘Stacy’ but unironic, etc., all designed to make men less confident in themselves and thus more easy to manipulate or more hostile to women and thus, making them unable to rectify these problems and gain more self-confidence. They have no reason to promote such ludicrous theory apart from their own gain, and as seen above they have much to gain and the demographics that feed into the incel community have much to give.

All in all, it seems obvious to me that incel ideology is astroturfed by political and financial interests who benefit more from men’s suffering than their happiness and health. Creating a self-perpetuating pool of the vulnerable and exploitable seems to be the end result of the pushing of such ideas, and concious of this or not the people who push it can benefit tremendously, and it’s very nature discourages seeking help from outside of incel circles, very similar to cult mentality, which of course is similarly abused by many for political or financial gain.",,,,,,,,
"People are just generally too stupid to have a say in anything, including me.","Not a native speaker so be patient

Lately I feel like i just don't believe that people are smart enough to argue anymore. People are too stupid to understand simple thing, people are misinformed, critical with information they don't agree with and yet at the same time those people can't view some other information critically. 

People are divided, unteachable, unchangeable. It doesn't make sense to sway people in the ""right"" direction by talking to them, trying to change their view. It is far easier to manipulate the masses and ignore the individual. They will follow, or maybe they won't - they are only one in a hundred.

Politicians are just saying the same phrases over and over without engaging in meaningful conversations, the public doesn't think, neither while criticising nor while praising said politicians. People just go with their gut, people love to think they are smart, and most of the time they are not. People are simply to stupid and there is no sign of change if we don't go with the populism route, doesn't matter if we sway them to the left or right, in the end they didn't understand, they just believe.

Everyday is see more and more idiots, i am at a point at which I think way over half the population of my country is too stupid to grasp simple concepts. I don't expect everyone to study every topic that the general public discusses, but maybe, just maybe people should at least lean their individual bias towards the opinion of experts that know what they are talking about. 

All of this includes me. I am no better. I am an expert at some things but I want to discuss all the things. I can be manipulated and I probably will be in the future. 

All of this leads me to believe that people are too stupid for almost anything. 

Trust me, i want my mind to be changed, i want to be able to believe that people as a whole can become informed again. People will learn to use the digital inventions as tools rather than a weapon. Misinformation and manipulation of the masses will be stopped. But right now, I don't believe that. 

(Quick heads up, i would like my view to be changed regarding a big group of people, i am aware that deep meaningful conversations can happen at a personal level, we can't go around and ""enlighten"" everybody one by one though, and who would I be to assume that my way of thinking is superior? I don't want to push my view onto other people, i just want everyone to have a view that they can argue with facts and a solid fundament. Not with the 5 sentences they hear repeated over and over on television)

TLDR: I believe people don't know anymore, don't think anymore. They just believe. Therefore they are to stupid to be trusted with important stuff like voting or whatever. I believe this is true for all ends of the political and social spectrums. The incredibly small minority that actually tries to inform themselves is neglectable in the context of whole countries.",,,,,,,,
No religion has epistemically better arguments or evidence for its claims than the others.,"I am an agnostic atheist - I consider that no religion has met the burden of proof on its claims. Note that this is not a positive claim of ""there is no god"", I don't know if there is one or not (that's the agnostic part) but I don't believe any one exists (that's the atheist part). There are some gods that I actively believe don't exist (like the god that answers every prayer immediately by doing what the person that prays asks for, since I just prayed for a sandwich and didn't get it), others I don't believe exist merely by lack of sufficient evidence or clear definition. Finally, there are what I call ""left-big-toeists"", who define something that exists as a god so they can claim god exists - pantheists who don't think the universe (as a whole) is conscious, sun worshippers, ""god is a feeling"" people, etc. I am sorry, but in order for something to be eligible to the ""god"" label in  my eyes, it has to at least be able of independent thought and action that disobeys the usual laws of physics. Left-big-toeists don't convince me.

For the purpose of this post, I'll consider ""religious claims"" only claims that would detectably contradict a naturalistic model of the universe.

I have been active in religious discussion / debate communities for years now, before I discovered reddit even. When engaging with theists of different flavors, something stuck me. Most of the arguments theists use to justify why *their* god(s) exist(s) and matches the description their religion makes of it can be applied equally well to gods the theist making the argument does not think exist. The theist making the argument has to apply different epistemic standards to their god than to the other gods in order to believe in one but not the others. As an outsider looking in, that smacks of either hypocrisy or ignorance and ruins the credibility of the argument, and therefore of the religion. If one religion is right, it should have *better* evidence than the wrong ones.

"The Term ""African American"" is outdated and inaccurate","The term ""african-american"" needs to be retired *forever*.  In it's current usuage it refers to a group of Americans  that descended  from african slaves. 

There's a few problems with it. 

1) ""-american"" normally refers to people that voluntarily come from their home country and move to the U.S. ""Chinese-americans"" are immigrants from china that came to america. ""Irish-americans"" are immigrants from Ireland that came to america. ""Sudanese-americans"" are immigrants from Sudan that came to america. I'm sure you see the pattern. Now, by definition slaves did not *voluntarily* come to the U.S  and they were not treated as people but as property. Essentially it would be like calling a cow from africa an ""african-american"" cow. 

2) White americans of settler ancestry  generally do not call themselves ""European-american"".  *Why is that?* They see themselves as ""americans"".  Shouldn't black americans be just ""americans"" as well? 

3) Being identified with an entire continent is insulting. Africa has 54 different countries within it. There are many different cultures, languages, and religions within it. So when you say the ""african"" in ""african american"" what does that even mean?  Does it mean people with dark skin? Curly hair? Big lips? Is that all there is to ethnicity?   Atleast, there is a culture behind being an American.  But to be *african american*?  There's no culture there, it's a term to loosely associate a group of melanated AMERICANS.",,,,,,,,
"A film like Black Panther, in which ethnic East Africans are portrayed by other people, should be considered as equally offensive as brownface or blackface","Disclaimer: Racial segregation does not drive my views. I want to hear the other side of people who enjoy those.

I am from a third-world country. Besides watching some content from my country, I primarily watch films produced in the West (Mainly American and British productions, because of the English language).

I am using Black Panther as my example, because it's well-known, grossed a lot, and it's watched by many people because of the race it's meant to represent. I am sure other films do this appropriation too.

It's based in a fictional country in East Africa, named after Uganda (there's no creativity there, but that's another topic). The main cast consisted of people of either complete or partial African ancestry, from the US, the UK, one actress from Mexico, everywhere except actual East Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa, broadly. And most of the actors are primarily of West African descent because of the slave trade. So, who's the film representing? East Africans, West Africans, Afro-Caribbeans, or African-Americans and Black British people? I wonder how the film and its sequel became a hit in West, East, and Southern Africa. In my opinion, it should be considered as equally offensive as people doing brownface or blackface.

Now, if they (Marvel, and Disney) really cared about representing Africans, and making their lives better, they could've done it with actual African actors, and shot it in an African country. Investing in their economy would've increased their quality of life.

I am not saying that people shouldn't like Black Panther. There are other reasons to like that film. But liking it only because your race is represented is egregious, especially when it's not even an actual representation.

I would like to hear the views of different sects of black people, marvel fans, or any other person.",,,,,,,,
Veganism is a radical ideology similar to a cult that is not really defendable rationally.,"The reason is that every discussion regarding health and environment can be eventually dealt with moderation and a model that reduces animal suffering but don't completely stop using their products all together. The problem with veganism is ultimately its central dogma that can be summed in a single sentence:

""All suffering of sentient beings must be avoided by humans if possible even at high cost"".

This is further extrapolated as follow:   
\- If an animals possesses a nervous system, no matter how simplistic it is, then it needs to to have equivalent rights as humans because by having nervous system, such animal is thus ""sentient"" and thus ""capable of suffering"". 

This line is extremely arbitrary, by a simple philosophical and neuropsychologic point of view, this extrapolation of the definition of ""suffering"" is absurd. Like a small child that covers their teddy bears with a sheet so they can be more comfortable, Vegans, are people that seem to have confused empathy and projections to how actually emotions are formulated on a human brain. Nevermind the fact that vegans try to preach this dogma and all the full set of rules of how to live like a cult-like religion, and fail to understand that moral is relative. If a group of people fail to impose their moral view to other group, they are the one seen as immoral by the other group. 

\- This is also another point I often seen being misused a lot lately: Not understanding the difference between moral and ethics, and how moral is relative to specific set of values of a group, and not necessarily superior to a different group's set of values. Only religious people deals in absolutist morals, secular people trend, however, with a more logical approach in the field of formal ethics. Sometimes we see vegans trying to arguments about how ""harming another animal is unethical"" and that is also a misconception that I'll deal ahead:   


Returning to the problem of suffering, one can draw several deconstructionists rhetorics to dismantle the need of veganism in the first place:

a) How can one objectively define SUFFERING from simple animals such as insects, bees or even fish? If you consider the concept of qualia in philosophy, the answer is pretty simple: It can't be. it is all subjective projection from human perspective. Thus the second point: 

b) Why avoid negative neurological stimuli at all? Why is it so bad? Isn't pain part of life? Would a pup deprived of all negative stimuli in all of its life even mature properly?  

\- Stating that ALL negative stimuli should be avoided at all costs is, again, ARBITRARY. Why stop at natural life and neurons? Modern A.I. simulations can be based on two types of simplistic stimuli to evolve a neural-network: avoidable and pursuable stimuli equally to a simple insect, in fact there are computer simulations more complex than insects currently running in many Tech universities around the world, shouldn't anything causing negative stimuli be avoided at all costs even in artificial machines created by humans?

c) Even if you ignore the concept of qualia or the definition of suffering, why draw the lines at neurons specifically and what kind of neurons one must possess to be considerable negatively enough of a stimuli? Nociceptors? - Plants also act according to positive and negative stimuli in nature (heat, cold, sunlight and even pressure-sensitive receptors i.e. Carnivore plants). 

d) If you must avoid ""negative stimuli"" of all animals possessing a nervous system, then shouldn't people also stop washing their faces altogether, as doing so kills hundreds of commensal mites that live in your eyelashes known as demodex? This is an example of how extremely low this line has been drawn and how ihenrently an appeal to emotion it is. 

In fact as someone with a Neuropsychology background and following the concept of simple negative stimuli being simply a biological mechanism that doesn't generate suffering in itself, suffering is a far more complex HUMAN concept, and extrapolating it to any simple negative stimuli is a misplaced empathy projection at best. I can say with certainty that not only insects can't actually ""suffer"" like humans do, neither do other creatures such as crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks or even fish. Any attempt to try and compare a fish splashing on a deck to a human experiencing all the emotional trauma of suffocating is ludicrous.

Allowing fish to ""feel pain"", or bees to work more for producing more honey to replenish the ones we take will not cause a quantum disbalance in the subatomic scale that would rip the fabric of space time apart or drag your soul to hell like your dogma makes people think it will. ""Pain"" does not annihilates gluons. This is just arbitrary oversensitivity nonsense that won't make you morally superior than omnivorous, 

There is however a much more complex discussion to be made about if higher mammals like pigs, dogs or cows actually experience ""suffering"" like humans and if self-awareness and consciousness are needed for that. I personally would draw the line in not causing suffering to animals with consciousness like great apes, cetaceans and some birds (no, chickens definitely do not have enough telencephalon to have consciousness even if they do feel pain), you can try and bring the bar down to cows and pigs too and I'd gladly bring qualia back again to justify how without consciousness this is only projection and oversensitivity, but that is a much longer discussion and also, irrelevant, because fundamentally vegans only bring the suffering of pigs dogs and cows as an appeal to emotion of how much they suffer compared to our precious little pets, the inherent fundament of Veganism has already been deconstructed above. You can chose to not eat cows or pigs because you personally feel bad about then, that is absolutely fine, But there is absolutely no logic in refraining from eating shrimp, tuna or honey. Because there is no reason to follow an arbitrary line created by a cult-like pseudoscientific dogma. 

Now, one may extrapolate and try to ignore the moral core of veganism and try to formulate environmental and health arguments, but for those, you aren't trending within the veganism radical bonds anymore and we can start and construct a more sensible argument in favor of more sustainable and ""humane"" pecuarian production instead of completely and nonsensically getting entirely rid of it.",,,,,,,,
Dr Fatima Cody Standford is misdirecting America,"I have recently in the past few months become obsessed with obesity. Looking at the data, it's so hard not to be pessimistic about the future of civilization. As Harvard projects, close to half of the USA's population will be obese by 2030 (1). I'm not going to trying to convince people that they shouldn't be obese, that is a personal choice someone is going to have to make. I'm also not going to tell people that they shouldn't love who they are or be happy with themselves.

However, what I do think, is that America has a serious problem and its stubbornness is not helping. Before I start my rant in the title, let me go through a few points that I think are very important. Nutrition education in America is absolutely terrible in the public school system. I could go on and on about how lobbying has destroyed every iteration of the ""food pyramid"" or now it is called ""myplate."" If you wanted to do your own research on that I highly recommend (2). From my personal anecdotal experience, I hope some of you can provide your own; outside of elementary school, we were not taught anything else about nutrition. (I was taught the food pyramid, which said you should have 6-11 servings of carb filled foods everyday). It's no wonder that people don't understand much about nutrition. It's taught to you at an age that you don't even know how to cook or even close to being able to understand your body. What they teach you still doesn't teach you what the different macronutrients do, why you need them, and why is it important at all.

I'm not going to say that parents aren't to blame, but they are also just products of a country that prides its freedom and profits over longevity and happiness. Semi-rant over.

I recently got introduced to Dr. Fatima Cody Standford (a health expert on the Biden administration) from her 60 minutes (3). In this interview she claims that the leading cause of obesity is genetics and that it is a brain disease that causes their body to not be able to lose weight. I was a bit stunned as a knee jerk reaction, as I'm sure most people were. After thinking about it and reading a few other of articles in which she is interviewed, I still disagree.

I'm not saying she isn't partially right, however, I think you can't realistically say that obesity is mainly caused by genetics, at least statistically. There are a few things I would like to point out.

1. If obesity was majorly caused by genetics, then you would expect that obesity levels would have always stayed around the same, however we are not seeing that as the obesity levels are rising every year at dramatic rates (4).
2. If obesity was majorly caused by genetics, you would expect Europe to have similar obesity rates to America, we don't see this at all. I think these statistics are a bit outdated, however, it can be seen that in Europe, generally is about 10% behind America in obesity prevalence. (5). Most American's lineage derives from Europe. If obesity was majorly genetically linked we would expect that Europe would have about the same obesity prevalence as America.

In another article Standford claims that ""This is the largest chronic disease worldwide, not just here in the U.S. Yes, everybody assumes it's a U.S. issue. We're actually ranked number 14 out of 200 countries. So we're not award-winning, we're not number 1, but we're behind 13 other countries. So this is a major, global issue."" (6)

What Standford fails to mention is that that 12 out of the 13 countries above us are island nations with insanely small populations and the only one that is notable is Kuwait, which has a population a little over 3 million. No where close to the population of the USA. This is such a lousy argument and seems like she is coping with how bad the problem has gotten in America. I'm not saying that obesity isn't a global issue, it most certainly is. However, we are the LEADING first world country of obesity. I think dismissing this and saying ""Oh we aren't number one"" is so ignorantly dismissive and loses credibility towards her arguments at least for me.

So where does this leave us? Well, I'm glad you asked. In my opinion, obesity can be attributed to a lot of different aspects of our lives. The list is long. Genetics, Processed foods plague America, loads of sugars are caked into everything, children adopt the diets of their parents, there isn't enough proper education of nutrition, and the number one reason of all; personal choice and the fact that most people simply just don't care about their health. (It can be an entire other post about this, so I'm not going to go into it). At some point for an individual, this spirals out of control and becomes chronic obesity in which there isn't much that can be done to help an individual besides medications or surgery and to the point in which Standford calls a ""brain disease.""

I don't think we can sit there and point a finger at one specific aspect of obesity and say ""this is what is wrong!"" It's not different than what we have done in the past, blaming fat or blaming carbs on people becoming unhealthy. None of these macronutrients are harmful by nature, but too much or too little is.

\------

Now this is when I get a little angry. I'm sure most people have seen the recent craze about Ozempic (generically called semaglutide). As many of you probably already know, this is a drug to treat type 2 diabetes, but has the side effect of losing weight. Dr. Standford is pushing this drug heavily. She consults pharma companies and touts this drug heavily while also being apart of the Biden administration. She claims in this news interview that these medications are making people realize that their weight changes ""are not all their fault."" While I have read up and have seen the benefits of this drug and it does work (albeit with a lot of side effects), it doesn't change the fact that once these people are off the drug, they will just regain the weight the lost.

As this article from The Journal of Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism says ""One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health."" (7). This article states that Ozempic is only safe to use up to 68 weeks (8).

I think Dr. Standford is being a shill for these pharmaceutical companies. Promising a miracle drug that will fix your problems. I agree with her that how we think about obesity is wrong, but I think she's is going down the wrong path by scapegoating genetics instead of trying to help fix a systemic, multi-faceted issue.

Anecdotally it seems that most people want simple solutions to complex issues in all aspects of life.

Let me know how you all feel about this issue, I would love to hear personal anecdotes and direct criticisms of my logic.

Thank you all for reading.",,,,,,,,
Transgender women have inherent privilege of cis women,"
Men top women in everything. Sports, corporate,  doctors ,lawyers,  physical strength, etc. You name it, men have a advantage over women. I go as far to say they rule the world. It would disingenuous to say they do not.

I say this to say, this is why trans women have innate privilege over cis women. Due to the privilege that their sex hold over us, it is easy for alot of them to maneuver into women's spaces without issues. When met with opposition,   women or the parties opposing trans women in certain cis spaces, are met with insults and law suits.

Take example womens sports, beauty representation etc. There is almost always a tran woman included in representation for cis women but trans men almost never are included in representation for men. 

Since females are see as lesser it's like we don't have the power to assert the authority for what is acceptable in everything that pertains to us. If you have males who don't want trans men in their spaces, without doubt i think that men would very much make it known. However it's not many trans men fighting to be the representation for men and be included in their spaces being that their female sex naturally makes them less adaptable to all that comes with being in cis men spaces. Agression,  competition,  strength,  etc (key characteristics of males). 

It's almost as if trans women have a entitlement attitude to be included in all  women's spaces (even those which are tied to our sex). Trans men tend to lack that entitlement due to their female sex making them less power in comparison to males.

For example take things like womens sports, prison placement for trans people,  the bathroom debate, women representation in context and consideration. Almost all the controversy is with trans women being in female spaces.

With sports alot the oppsition comes from trans women being physically superior to cis women. With the bathrooms the opposition comes from lack of privacy,  risk/concearn of sexual assault, same thing for women's prisions. Brands such as ulta, Victoria secret include trans women in women's beauty promotion. However you rarely hear trans men fighting to be in mens sports, fighting to use men bathrooms, be housed in mens facilities (prisons,  shelters etc). 1 notable reason is alot them still have their vaginas so would be very susceptible to sex based violence.  The other is I think that trans men realize this disadvantage they will have in male spaces due to their sex.",,,,,,,,
Vinyl is an objectively bad audio storage format when compared to digital,"Disclaimer: I'm not an audio engineer, scientist or audiophile. I don't own any vinyl records. I'm a relative layman, and my primary interest is computer science, but I'm looking to learn more about audio formats.

As you might know, vinyl has been going through a resurgence in the last decade or so. I don't have issues with that, and I'm indifferent to people buying vinyl to collect physical media or for nostalgic reasons. However, I do take issue with some people claiming the vinyl is ""simply better"" than any digital audio formats, saying that there is something irreplaceable with vinyl sound and that it's simply the best format for storing audio. Here is why I disagree:

1. **It distorts the recorded sound:** in my mind, an audio format should have only one primary goal - to be able to reproduce a recording that was put onto it as closely as possible. Now, vinyl was a good and cheap solution for its time, but in comparison to modern technology, it seems very outdated. Think of the stereotypical ""vinyl sound"" - the hissing noise with scratchy, cracking sounds. I've never heard a vinyl recording that didn't feature these distortions, and it points to an inability to record clean-sounding audio, which is bad. Add to that the potential distortion from other sources (like a turntable not spinning at precisely the right speed), and it feels like analog formats like these are just.. worse. I'm not saying these are major factors that everyone will care a whole lot about, but reciting the first sentence - if the goal is to reproduce recorded sound as closely as possible, then I don't think anything can rival a digital recording. With a digital format, the only difference between the audio you have and the audio that the music producers had is the equipment that you play it on.

2. **It's not really subjective:** a fairly common argument to give credence to vinyl is that people simply experience music differently, hence why the artifacts and noise in a recording might actually be enjoyed by someone. But why should we want that - and more importantly, is this unique to vinyl? Seriously, to offer a comparison - we're pretty decent at grading and comparing, for example, monitor color reproduction. With that industry, there is such a thing as simply being better - a monitor having better brightness, contrast, color accuracy, etc. If no one wants to view everything on a distorted monitor, why would anyone want to listen to distorted music? And.. speaking about these artifacts, couldn't they just be reproduced digitally if needed? Since it's all just sound, I don't see what would stop someone from recording a vinyl to digital, or making a digital filter, and getting the exact same listening experience.

3. **It seems extremely fragile:** ideally, a storage format should be fairly durable. Digital is perfect, or almost perfect, with this - if you record digital data, it will always stay identical, no matter how much you access it. This, of course, excludes the possibility of the actual storage medium (like a hard drive) degrading and breaking down, but even then, the digital data can be easily duplicated indefinitely. The 10000th copy will be identical to the first. On the other hand, not only will analog recordings degrade in quality as they are copied, but vinyl just seems extremely fragile. Even in the audiophile circles, there seem to always be discussions on keeping records dust-free, clean, temperature-controlled and so on. But even then, temperature fluctuations and just mere normal use (with the needle scratching the record's surface) will eventually wear it down. How is this not viewed as a major flaw of the format? If I had a record that I knew was going to wear down quickly just by playing it, I'd probably not play it at all to avoid damaging it. When comparing this to infinite replayability of a digital format, this seems like a no-brainer to me.",,,,,,,,
"Now is the best time to buy a manual car, and manual performance cars especially are a going to be a good investment","Im mainly thinking about this based on the car Im currently looking to buy next (BMW 340i, 6MT, 2016-2018)

But I wanna hear some more perspectives. 

From a strictly financial standpoint, it makes most sense to buy a manual car right now over an automatic car.

Im mainly referring to cars that are offered with both. I know there's probably some auto super cars that will also become good investments.

Basically, manual cars, and especially manual performance cars, are becoming increasingly rare these days. Many auto makers dont make them anymore. BMW only offers a manual on the M3/4 and M2 now, compared to before when you could get a manual on almost all of their base models. It's very unlikely they'll bring it back for regular 3 or 2 series cars. Other automakers are increasingly replacing their cars with hybrid or EV variants, obviously phasing out manuals. 

As a result of this, I think the modern manual cars we do have from the last decade (and older ones too) are going to start appreciating very soon. I know cars generally depreciate, but that is usually because there are better alternatives. EVs are great, but they'll never replace the feeling of an ICE with 3 pedals, so enthusiasts will still be interested in the older cars. 

As it's increasingly difficult to buy a new manual car, the prices for older manual cars are stagnating right now, and will begin to rise, as they're the only options that are realistically obtainable (for now).

As a result, if you're in the market for a used car right now, you should get the manual variant if you can, as it's much more likely to appreciate in value and as a result make it a more justifiable purchase over the auto variant (which may be similar in price right now, but will lose much more value over the next decade).

Am I making sense or am I just using dumb logic to spend my money on a car I absolutely don't need (but want really badly)?",,,,,,,,
"Cheesecake is actually pie, not cake","It's Pi day (3 /14) today, so let's talk about whether cheesecake is really a pie. Cheesecake, of course, has ""cake"" as part of the name. But is it really? A pie is typically something like ""a baked dish with a filling on top and a base of pastry."" Whereas, a cake is typically something like ""a baked, sweet, bread-like dish made from a dough mixture of flour, shortening, eggs, sugar, and leavening."" While there is some overlap, and also there are always some weird outlier cases, it seems to me that you're typical cheesecake fits better into the category of ""pie"" than into the category of ""cake.""

"Support for the phrase ""trans women are women"" is completely orthogonal to trans social policy","I see the phrase ""trans women are women"" as being a totally semantic debate. A pro-trans person and an anti-trans person who have both read and fully understood all the research being done on this topic, would not disagree about any of the following statements:

* With current technology, trans women don't produce eggs.
* With current technology, trans women can't get pregnant.
* With current technology, the overwhelming majority of trans women have XY chromosomes.
* With current technology, trans women who medically transition have some of the secondary sex characteristics typical of cis women.

The question of what relationship any of those things have to the word ""woman"" is where the entirety of this particular part of the debate takes place, and that can't be answered by science itself. It's a basic [lumpers vs splitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpers_and_splitters) debate. Should we have lots of specific, tiny subcategories, or a few larger supercategories, and what are the exact borders of each categorization scheme? There's no objective answer to this question - it's all about what turns out to be useful and convenient for people in a field to talk about.

But there's another issue. There's also no necessary connection between acceptance of the phrase ""trans women are women"", and the belief that trans women and cis women should be treated 100% equally under social policy.

Cis women with serious medical conditions that make it dangerous for them to play sports are women, but as a society we should ideally do some gatekeeping to keep them out of most sports.

Clearly, merely being a woman isn't enough to justify including someone in women's sports, as long as there are specific traits a person might have that justifies such exclusion. The question then becomes whether trans women have any traits that might justify their exclusion from a given women's sport? And my general approach is that I trust international sports bodies to eventually reach rules that will be appropriate to any empirical facts about each sport on a case-by-case basis.

That might look like the World Rugby association [banning trans women](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/sports/olympics/world-rugby-transgender-women.html) from its women's sports categories, while other international sporting bodies might opt for full trans inclusion. Sporting rules are essentially arbitrary, and every sport has to decide what kind of competitions they want. If people don't like it, they can also create new sporting bodies with more exclusive or inclusive categories if they want and have them compete in the free market for money and attention.

Sports is sort of a side example, in any case. The real meat of the question is for topics tied to day-to-day life, do the rights and needs of cis women and trans women ever come into conflict, and if so, how should we resolve such conflicts?

No right is absolute in any system of liberal democracy. Every liberal democracy has to decide if the freedom of religion includes the permission to sacrifice animals as part of religious practice, or marry more than one woman, or refuse life-saving blood transfusions to children. In the United States, we've decided that the state can ban all of those practices without violating the freedom of religion.

Trans people have rights under liberal democracy, but it is for each liberal democracy to determine where the edges of those rights are, and what to do in claimed areas of conflict.

J.K Rowling's old tweet:

&gt; Dress however you please.
&gt;
&gt; Call yourself whatever you like.
&gt;
&gt; Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you. 
&gt;
&gt; Live your best life in peace and security. 
&gt;
&gt; But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? 
&gt;
&gt; #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill

Is a fundamentally liberal position. She's for trans tolerance in a wide variety of social circumstances, but in a few limited domains like bathrooms and prisons she doesn't think that inclusions should be extended, for alleged safety concerns. In a representative democracy, people have to vote in politicians who they trust to weigh such claims and shape policy around dealing with conflicts and limits of rights that might arise.

In any case, my core argument is that the following are both possible:

* A person believes ""trans women are women"", and that specific decisions for where to include or exclude trans people should be done on a case by case or domain by domain basis.
* A person believes ""trans women are **not** women"", and that trans women should be allowed to have access to every social space that cis women are allowed in.",,,,,,,,
Human extinction from climate/environmental issues is not a serious threat.,"I see a lot of people on social media and certain political commentators who claim humanity is heading towards extinction in the relatively near future (let’s say the next century or two) due to climate change.

But it seems like virtually no experts are making these kinds of claims. Populations experts are forecasting for human population to increase for the next 40-70 years before slowly dropping for the next century afterwards due to declining birth rates. They give no indication of expected mass die offs at all, much less actual extinction level die offs. 

It is my view that there is no good reason to think human extinction from climate change/environmental degradation is even a real threat on any sort of timescale meaningful to us. I believe people who speak of this coming extinction are almost likely driven by either post apocalyptic fantasies, or have been propagandized by political/corporate interests who seek more money/power and find fearmongering to be an effective way to achieve their goals.",,,,,,,,

Fighting serves no purpose in hockey anymore and should just be banned.,"I grew up watching and enjoying fighting in ice hockey, but over the years I've come to find it to be a bit of a sideshow. Hockey is a sport that rewards speed, coordination, reaction time, and physicality. The idea that you're just going to stop that game every now and then for a bareknuckle boxing match -when you really think about it- is kind of absurd. 

The typical argument you hear in favour of fighting is that it serves as a form of ""self-policing"" among players. Outside of a few anecdotes, I'm not sure this is supported by any data. Leagues where fighting isn't permitted don't have a higher incidence of violent, illegal hits. In my experience, it's leagues where fighting is more pronounced that have a tendency to be more goon-ish in general. Just look at the old NHL. I don't think anyone would suggest that since the NHL made fighting more rare, the league has become more violent or dangerous. Quite the opposite, it's proved that a different approach to officiating can ensure player safety without fighting. 

If anything, it's clear that fighting is more of a hazard to player safety than anything. How many guys end up with serious health issues stemming from that repeated head trauma, to say nothing of those who have actually been killed on the ice?

It creates a race to the bottom, where teams feel they need to have players on the ice whose value is derived from being obscenely physical. Since the opposing team has one of those players, you need one too, and so on. Then there's a critical mass of players on either team who can't really contribute beyond their ability to potentially hurt other players. It's just an arms race. 

I think the real argument for fighting is that some fans enjoy watching it. It's not about player safety. It's not about the 'code.' But if you want to watch a fight, watch MMA. The NHL's rule changes that have greatly restricted fighting have also allowed it to become a more graceful, skillful game. I'd rather see the Cale Makars and Connor McDavids of the world do what they do then see a few guys who can barely skate rearrange each other's faces a couple times a game.",,,,,,,,
We should Bring back physical home buttons on smartphones,"As a user who has been loyal to smartphones for years, I am appalled by the trend of phasing out physical home buttons. I honestly believe that the decision to do away with this essential feature is not only illogical but also an insult to users who rely on it daily. In this post, I will explain why I want physical home buttons to be back on smartphones and why I am so angry about their removal.

First and foremost, physical home buttons were intuitive and easy to use. They offered a simple and convenient way to navigate through the phone's interface, switch between apps, and return to the home screen. With physical home buttons, I could perform all these tasks with one hand, without having to stretch my fingers or struggle to reach the virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen. The tactile feedback provided by the physical button was also reassuring, giving me a sense of control and responsiveness that I cannot get with virtual buttons.

Secondly, physical home buttons were reliable and durable. Unlike virtual buttons, they did not suffer from accidental presses or screen burn-in, and they did not require constant calibration or adjustment. Physical buttons were also more resistant to wear and tear, and they could withstand accidental drops or impacts without cracking or malfunctioning. In contrast, virtual buttons are prone to malfunctioning, especially when the screen is wet or dirty, and they are more likely to break or stop working altogether.

Physical home buttons just felt good. Mobile companies not everything has to be virtual and sleek to be good. Why ruin a stuff when it was working well.

Gender Dysphoria should be treated like Depression,"This has always confused me, and I’m open to my mind being changed or gaining more information on the topic.

I believe that Gender Dysphoria should be treated like depression, and it’s because of my personal experience.

I had a very close child-hood friend that I even ended up dating. However, she’s always struggled with some serious depression and body issues.

To me it made no sense, I saw her as beautiful and awesome. To me she was 10/10, she was great. 

To her though she was some kind of monster. She really hated herself, her appearance, her personality. The way she saw herself was irrational and she couldn’t even explain it. This would lead to a lot of self-harm and even suicidal attempts. 

Thankfully, she was finally able to get professional medical help. She has a great therapist who has seriously invested time in her and helped her.

She has learned and is still learning to accept and start loving herself for who she is. She doesn’t self harm anymore, she does have bad moments but she’s unfathomably better than she was before.

I understand a lot of people suffering with gender dysphoria also go through depression and have this irrational hatred towards themselves. When they see themselves they hate that they were born a boy/girl.

My view is, why aren’t we helping them learn to love themselves and accept themselves for who they are? Todays culture pushes them to change instead of loving and accepting themselves. 

Shouldn’t it be treated like depression where they slowly learn to stop hating themselves and love who they are?",,,,,,,,
"The move to a 4 day, 32 hour work week is dangerous to worker's income IF it is passed before, or without, worker's rights and wage protection legislation that is specifically made for the change in hours.","I had a nice, big writeup and realized I can just iterate my worry more succinctly:

Businesses that can, will, use this to save costs.

Stan McBusinessowner says, ""All of the product, possibly more, we're used to creating can be generated in 80% of the time? Oh, cool, that's a 20% reduction in labor cost!"" While Kelly Employee loses 20% of her paycheck.

Are the industries where this cannot happen greater than I can imagine? Would, perhaps, the effects on the job market create an effect where wages grow to compensate and I just don't see it? Are there workers protections wrapped into this legislation? Chances of a bill like this passing are probably low, are we probably just going to see conversation and evolution and not this change immediately?",,,,,,,,

Victim blaming is sometimes warranted depending on the situation,"The example that comes to mind is a lot of celebrities are sports people are posting pictures of private messages they get which contain mean things. Yet these people have their DM's open for anyone to message them. Just disable them. 

The world does not revolve around you, people are not going to like you. If you are in the public eye and have made it possible for people to contact you then they are allowed to do so. You have voluntarily given them a method of doing so. It's then dumb to complain that the things said to you aren't all nice. You can't control what others do, you can control what you do. So block them, ignore them or disable DMs. It's not hard.

Either way these people are the victims. It's either ""I don't want mean things said to me"" or ""I shouldn't have to disable my DM's"". Tough shit. You are insane if you think every individual in the world who has a negative opinion of you should be censored.

"Sex is a desire, not a need.","I'm asexual and I just don't get it when people call sex their ""physical needs"".  
A ""need"" is something you can NOT literally survive without. Food, water, air, even human connection are needs. A ""desire"" is a deep craving for something. It is not the same as a need.   
Sex is not a need. If it was, asexuals who don't indulge and celibate people would have died after a while. You will not die just because you didn't have sex like you will if you go without water for a year. Saying that sex is a need is the same as saying that alcohol is a need just because you crave it as hell. It is a stupid, just a STUPID phrase to call sex your ""physical NEEDS"".  
And we're not talking about the need of survival of the human race on Earth, no. By ""sex is a desire not a need"", I mean that it is not necessary for a human to survive.  
Of course I'm asexual and don't understand the idea of sex being fun, so if someone is able to help me see how it's a need for allos, I'll be willing to change my view.",,,,,,,,
Joel made the right choice in the last of us finale,"Firstly, I’d like to say that I believe Joel did the right thing in a general sense. Not the right thing by the world nor by Ellie.

Sections of my reasoning: 

1.) “First, do no harm” 

2.) Reliability and probability

3.) Who will be in possession of the resulting vaccine. 

4.) Choice 

“First, Do no harm” 

This is the first phrase that new doctors recite when they become Medical Doctors during the Hippocratic oath. This phrase comes from Hippocrates work “Of the epidemic”. In this work, among other things Hippocrates states: 

“The physician must be able to tell the antecedents, know the present, and foretell the future—must mediate these things, and have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm” 

The key take away from this is that no modern physician weighs the good of many more than the good of a few. If this weren’t the case we would kill hundreds of people a year to save thousands waiting on the transplant list. Hippocrates states “Know the present, foretell the future” which leads me to my next point. 

The probability that the operation that kills Ellie results in a vaccine is unknown. While the firefly surgeon is hopeful that it will be a positive outcome, they have no way of knowing what the actual result would be. Could the vaccine actually be made? Could it cause a mutation that would be worse? Could it all be for nothing if cordyceps evolves to counter the vaccine? With so many variables, the only thing that is a sure thing is the death of Ellie. The surgeon is ensuring death of his patient for the small chance of ending the apocalypse. The surgeon is violating the sacred oath he took. Rationally, it makes no sense. 

Secondly, let’s say that the operation went through, Ellie died, and a vaccine was successfully made. Who has possession of it? The firefly’s, who for better or worse are just the apocalyptic version of the Taliban. A terrorist group using indiscriminate explosives to wage war on a regime in the name of freedom. Do you think they’d sing songs with FEDRA while equally giving access to the vaccine for everyone? No, probably not. they’d use it as tool for their own personal gain. 

Now, let’s say that FEDRA, The firefly’s, and every other group all got along and wanted to disperse the vaccine. Looking at Covid, do you think that the remaining survivors would openly agree to a vaccine? I don’t think the vast majority of them would even consider getting the vaccine, let alone even allow people close enough to them without violence. Even if the vaccine was created, and that’s a huge if, the distribution and handling of it would never work.


Lastly, Ellie deserves the power to make the choice for herself. 

Before Joel and Ellie reach the hospital Ellie directly states plans for after she “saves the world”. Which if I’m not mistaken didn’t include dying less than a few hours later. This shows she had no intention of dying as a result of the operation. 

Marlene decided to not tell Ellie that she would die as a result of the operation, she lies to her in order to “protect” her. Then, when Joel requests to see her he is threatened with violence, told he can’t see her, and is escorted at gun point off the property. 

If Marlene had told Ellie the truth, and she agreed to it, Joel most likely wouldn’t have gone nuclear and smoked the entire crew.

Despite Ellie’s feelings in the future, Joel gave her the opportunity to decide. 

Damning the already damned world for someone you care about isn’t wrong, even more when the likely hood of success is close to zero.

TLDR: 

Killing Ellie for the slight possibility of creating a vaccine the apocalypse taliban would use as a weapon is completely stupid. See you in hell, fireflies

I don't like mandalorians. They're a savage group. And I don't like how popular they are.,"That's exactly what I said. They're a savage group who follows blindly a set of values that have got them into trouble.

When there isn't an external enemy they just fight each other, making their planet not have one single tree up because of wars - resource mining and battles making creation of wildlife impossible.

Not to mention they're expansionist and only stopped doing that because they got bigger problems. Or else they would just dominate other planets, because they're violent.

And each time they get rightfully obliterated - because they're dangerous - they get more extreme. Can't take your helmet off, can't do this, can't do that, like a damn cult.

How the hell am I supposed to like a culture, a group of people, who are based on violence?

And is the average fan just so much into them for cool armor and cool looks, not realizing they were warmongers and violent people even before the equally warmonger and violent Empire?

AI-powered dating app bots that get you dates are ethical,"Got tired of wasting so much time on all my dating apps just to scrape together a date or two a month. So as a passion project, I decided to build an AI-powered dating app bot that could do all the swiping and chatting for me to get numbers. Using dating apps I found that once I actually got a girls number and could call her, I could usually build enough rapport with my charisma to schedule a date.

It was important to me to make sure the bot only swiped right on girls that were actually my type. It was also crucial that when the bot chatted with my matches it sounded like me and used as few possible back and forths as possible to get the number. Once I got the number, I would call the girl, build rapport and schedule a date. This wasn't easy to build. The bot is designed to learn my preferences based on my previous matches, allowing it to understand my type of girl and engage in meaningful conversations that are tailored to my interests. This was built using a fine tuned version of GPT-3 trained on 5k conversations that got a girls number and MobileNet V3 for classifying my ""type"". 

The results have been astounding. In the first month, the bot scheduled 13 dates for me, all of which were with girls who matched my preferences and had similar interests to mine. I no longer have to waste time swiping aimlessly or struggling to come up with conversation starters. What's important here is that when I call the girl, I explain to them that they were talking to a bot on the dating app. So far, every girl has laughed it off and been impressed that I could build such a thing.

Movie critics should stop reviewing MCU movies,"Ok now this isn't necessarily a fully-formed opinion, but I think there's something here so please hear me out and help me poke some holes in it.

Many critics of the latest few Marvel/MCU movies (e.g. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thor: Love and Thunder) have left reviews along the lines of ""there are too many Marvel movies, the tropes are tired and the beats are predictable"". 

Is this a valid opinion to have? Yes, of course. 

...Is this a useful criticism of the 35th installation in a superhero movie franchise? I would say no.

My opinion is that MCU movies reached a point (probably after Infinity War) of being nerdy enough that the only people in the public still watching them, are people that have watched all/most of them, enjoy the superhero trope, and appreciate the weird universe-expanding format.

At this point it's like a comic franchise... imagine if critics reviewed each new Marvel comic by saying ""there are too many superhero comics, the tropes are tired"". That's not a fair criticism of a Marvel comic, so should it be of a Marvel movie?

The critics' Rotten Tomatoes score of Quantumania is 47, and the audience's score is 83. This to me perfectly illustrates that the consumers of Marvel movies are generally much more bought into the format, than the average critic. People who are sick of superhero movies are no longer watching these movies, and will not go see the next movie depending on critics' opinions.  

So to round up my opinion, I think that most critics should stop reviewing most MCU movies. Maybe some stand on their own as fun stories and can be watched in isolation, but the more world building weirdness there is, the worse this will get, and at one point critic reviews will be completely useless.",,,,,,,,
I don’t think there is anything that is not okay to joke about.,"I recently had a debate with someone who thought that certain things are not okay to laugh at and I completely disagree.

I think EVERYTHING can be funny if the joke it told the proper way. I would even say I’ve probably heard/seen something funny about every serious, sad, horrific and distressing subject matter.

There is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about. 

* Time &amp; place: I don’t think unsolicited jokes will be received well and that’s understandable. In passing, on the street, at work, at school or even among friends. If someone comes to a show or chooses to watch/listen to media with jokes, I think that those are the few places where *everything* is okay to joke about. Telling a sexist joke to someone while they looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time. 


So given the proper time and place, I think everything has the green light. I am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way. I’m not saying no one will be offended, doesn’t make it less funny for some either. 

There is nuance, there is talent when it comes to jokes. Not everyone can write and or perform them as well as others.

So let’s see if you can come up with something that I have not found humorous.",,,,,,,,
making DeepFake pornography illegal is ableist.,"Some people can visualize their thoughts better than others. Some have wider imaginations and some have better abilities to draw pictures than others.

"If You’re Struggling With People Not Using Your Pronouns, It’s Probably Your Fault","EXCEPTIONS: If you are dealing with people who knew you pre transition and if your pronouns AREN’T she/her or he/him.

If you are transgender, you should put in the work to pass as the gender you feel connected with. Even Mike Tyson could pass as a woman (albeit a very ugly one) with the right makeup, hair, and outfit. 

As a trans person, if you’re constantly struggling with new people not respecting your pronouns, the issue is likely with you. If you truly identify with the opposite gender, then you must recognize that your inherent features look masculine/feminine and that you have to put in extra work to make them less apparent than someone cisgendered. And if you’re not willing to go that extra step, then I’d question whether or not you’re really trans.

At the end of the day, gender is a social construct. If you feel so strongly with one manmade social construct over another that you would be willing to undergo permanent life altering surgery to be recognized as that other gender, then putting in the work to look the part should be easy. 

If you think “no matter how I look, people should accept, respect, and acknowledge my gender identity” then that’s fine and well, but pretty much the sole component of the social construct of gender is your physical appearance. Genders are, at their core, physical archetypes. Nobody can see your chromosomes and behavior dictates nothing. If you don’t care to put in the work to change yourself physically, then you’re probably not trans.",,,,,,,,

I don't understand on why pronouns mean so much to transgender people.,"So  I tend to not judge people for how they feel. I have always been able  to accept two gay males or two gay females loving each other. Or even a  male transitioning into a female and a male transitioning into a female  because people who can transition to another gender scientifically is  possible.

But the whole  identifying people are ""they"" ""them"" with their pronouns is the most  ridiculous thing to me with this whole gender war happening in the world  today especially in the USA today.

You  can live life how you generally please. Females don't need  to be child  bearers. And males don't need to be this masculine male that people .

So  I don't understand why someone feels the need to be addressed with a   particular set of pronouns. To me, it's like ok, I can call you that,   but then it seems to me that you're just doubling down on the idea that  rigid gender differences do matter. Which I don't think they do. You're   just you, an individual person. And all this crap people give with he  and she since it is what we've been using for a long time, so I don't  see how a different  pronoun will change anything that matters.

With  the logic from this it means that i can identify as a turkey sandwich  or a 99 year old female because the same concepts apply to what gender means to these people.

I don't mean to sound rude to people but scientifically it has never at all made sense to me so",,,,,,,,
"Debating about ""robots rights"" outside the realm of science fiction is ridiculous","I love robot stories. I think it's really interesting to think about how robots would be integrated in our society, from the most basic ones to complex IAs that could perfectly mimic human behaviour. It's an interesting thought-experiment that can also serve really well as social commentary.

But that's what it is for me: fiction. I can't take the idea of robots having rights seriously. A robot, no matter how advanced, complex and human like, would be nothing more than a home appliance. It would be a human creation, just like cars or microwaves, not a human, not an animal, they wouldn't even be sentient, just lines of codes mimicking human behaviour and thinking, depending solely on our tendency to anthropomorphize non-human things. Giving robots rights is no different than giving an intelligent blender rights.

I often see discussions about robots popping up here and there, with some fervent defendants that they should have rights as long as they reach the point where they ""act just like humans"" (which is a problematic view for whole other reasons, like ""what does acting like humans mean? So less intelligent robots that couldn't pass as humans wouldn't have rights? Why not?""), but for me a robot with human like intelligence still holds less value than a fly (of course, I'm talking about the ""value of life"" here, not monetary or personal importance).",,,,,,,,
"I believe that U.S. Organ Donation Should be a soft Opt-out system, not opt-in."," 

This argument was probably already said before. But organ donation is something I feel like everyone should do. I know some hard opt-out policies infringe on individual body liberties and choices(government taking) and also religious complications. It was stated that 95% of Americans are in favor of organ donations, but only 58% are actually registered (Donor Network West 2023). So how do we get the 37% of people to register to donate? A Soft Opt-out organ donation system, where everyone is defaulted “presumed” to want to be an organ donor. Those who do not want to donate would be able to opt-out easily through a nationwide website registry. Under this opt out policy:

* Those who are above 18 will be automatically added to a donor registry
* Those who are under 18 will still need parental consent to be added to the donor registry, but will automatically be added once they are 18.
* Individuals who are unable to make their own decisions will still be added to the donor network registry, but their Next of Kin or legal guardian can opt-out for them.
* To be added to the registry you need to be a US citizen or have a SSN
* Anyone during anytime can opt-out of becoming an organ donor
* During a death of a patient who did not opt-out, a representative from a donor network will talk to the family and “authorize” the default of donation in terms of the status quo. This gives the family an opportunity to ensure the potential donor’s preferences are regarded, in the event they have not opted out for whatever reason.

I feel like this is similar to the current opt-in system. Where if someone dies, whether they are a donor or not, a representative from a donor network still goes and asks about organ donation. But in the opt-out system, a representative goes and authorizes the default decision of organ donation if the person did not opt out. This principle goes on the assumption that people will just go with the default choice on what society normally does. By normalizing organ donation, we can increase the number of organ doners.

It can make the Next of Kin less stressed during this time because they do not need to think about what person actually wanted, because if they didn't want to donate they would have opted out. In the event the Next of Kin does not want to donate(and the deceased did not opt out), then we would go by what the Next of Kin wanted (similar to the current organ donation process). I feel like this would be the best of both worlds policy. It may increase the organ donation pool in a sense that people will want to go by the status quo, but still take into consideration family and religious views, so they can opt out for the deceased.

Would there be any downsides to this policy?",,,,,,,,
There is nothing wrong with using AI for schoolwork," I believe so long as you don't plagiarize and have it complete your work for you, there's nothing unethical about using AI to assist you with homework. I used it to give me an idea for a thesis statement, noted sections of the book where the concepts where spoken of but wrote the overall paper on my own and as such it is my work.

To me this is no different from using a calculator, the internet, or going to the library and getting help from a librarian. Like it or not AI is going to become a mainstream tool and we should be embracing the tools that will be used as society progresses. 

So if AI assist people in learning, banning it from usage means you just want to make things harder rather that assist the person in learning to me.",,,,,,,,
It’s not people’s individual fault they’re obese.,"I know this is gonna ruffle some feathers. The obesity epidemic is real. The top 3 most used medications in the US are for diabetes and high blood pressure. 

I used to be obese. I’ve lost almost 90lbs. There is a strong narrative that people who are fat are lazy and it’s all their fault they’re fat. If you just eat less and exercise more that you’ll be thin. There’s an extreme amount of scrutiny and stigma around weight. I’d even say there are few things in society that’s seen as worse than being fat.

The thing is I don’t believe it’s people’s personal fault they’re fat in over 90% of cases. I’d argue almost all obesity is caused by metabolic disease and malnutrition in our regular diets. Some people react more poorly to that diet than others genetically. I think there are some more prone to metabolic disease. Why can some eat candy and KFC be just fine and others not? 

Metabolic disease is caused by sugar, white bread, pasta, white rice and other processed carbs. Metabolic disease causes Constantly high insulin levels and fat on the organs begin WAAAY before anything shows up as off on regular tests from a doctor. You can have high insulin for 25 years before you’re diabetic. Id wager almost all obese people have pretty high insulin levels, even if they think they’re healthy now. 

What happens when your insulin levels are high? Constant hunger, malabsorption of vitamins, and the body quickly packing on fat as the metabolism can no longer turn calories into energy. Cells become damaged. Like a viscous cycle the more you eat, the hungrier you feel, the higher your blood sugar, the hungrier you are, the less your body can absorb nutrients and so on. As someone who’s experienced it myself it feels like you’re dying, you’re starving to death. Your brain is in panic, screaming to eat. Yet you’re becoming fatter and fatter.

Much like famine, obesity is very much an issue of the government and politics promoting a deadly diet. Think of Victorian diseases like rickets or scurvy caused by poor diet and poverty. Do we shame them the same way?

Our food is pumped full of sugar and processed to the point it’s leeched of all nutrition. Corporations like nestle started the trend of added sugar in the 80’s from the fat free fad, other corporations added sugar to keep up competively in the market. Because sugar tastes good. 

If you look at nutrition labels you’ll be SHOCKED how much carbs and sugar is in almost everything. Doctors rarely give helpful nutritional advice because they aren’t trained well in it. There’s very few resources and very little education. 

By the time you’re obese you have to be extremely strict, you can’t go out to eat with friends, you have to focus most of your life to weight loss. It is extremely difficult, and very slow. 

Obesity is complex. It is not calories in vs calories out most of the time.

Even if someone is overeating it’s not their fault directly. But the fault of addictive food, and hormonal issues that make the brain go haywire and disease. It’s the fault of no education, the fault of poverty. The fault of big sugar (a food that has zero nutritional value) yet is in almost everything from wheat bread to pasta sauce. 

I can guarantee is it was easy to not be obese no one would be. Everyone who is over weight would press a button to be thin if they could.




No one wants to be fat, no one is happy being fat. You are told 24/7 you’re worth less, deserve less and are unattractive. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves. 

If everyone could just be thin, they would be. 

The problem is our food. The amount of processed food and sugar is insane. 


If you’ve never been fat you have no idea what it’s like",,,,,,,,
Economic systems have negative impact on society... but that's not really their problem.,"I've been reading a lot of CMV complaining about how Capitalism has a negative impact on society. Things like a decrease in general mental health, an abused work force and etc. And I agree with all of it! 

The thing I'm on the fence about is ... I don't really see how that's something we can blame on our chosen economic system since... well it was never it's goal in the first place.

Isn't an economics system sole goal to dictate how goods are produced and distributed and attempt to maximize the output? All the economics system I know of have some variance on how this is achieved, but the goal remains the same. The mission statement isn't ""Make everyone happy"" it's ""Make as much product/money as possible"". So that's really the only reasonable criteria upon which  we can criticize capitalism - ""Does it maximize production?""

It doesn't seem reasonable to blame a fruit tree for making a shitty tasting fruit... well yeah, it's goal was never to feed you in the first place... it's goal was to spread it's seed. Can't fault it for making a fruit not edible to humans.

I guess ultimately - my POV is : you can't blame XYZ economic system for being shitty based on societal issues, it wasn't designed to handle those issues.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : You can't blame Capitalism for being shitty to people, if it's goal was never to \*not\* be shitty to people.",,,,,,,,
I think I rather be a self-aware android than being a human being,"I often find myself having irrational thoughts. Even if I am aware that my anger is not rational, I struggle to let go of certain issues that bother me. Psychological problems is often due to insecurities or a chemical imbalance in one's brain. It is really difficult to solve these issues.

Unfortunately, as a human, I am prone to experiencing intense emotions that can cloud my judgment and lead me to think illogically. I often wish I were a machine, free from the burden of emotions such as depression and anxiety.

That being said, being an android would seem like the best bet. I hate being human, and I hate feeling insecurities or having an inflated ego.",,,,,,,,
"""Trumps"" Banking Deregulation was NOT a bad thing","I've been seeing a lot on Reddit that Trump caused the recent banking failure because he passed the 2018 Economic Growth Act, and that he was deregulating banks which caused this crisis. It seems most people didn't even read the bill or understand why it was recommended by researchers at Harvard Kennedy School (people much smarter than that orange baboon). This was done for reasons outside MAGAland.

Since the Dodd-Frank Act got passed all banks with more than $10 billion in assets were treated much the same way; this is good right? All banks get regulated? Well, there were more second-order effects than regulators realized; these banking regulations were applied to tiny, regional, and commercial banks even though they had nothing to do with the MBS shenanigans that resulted in the financial crisis. 

**Regional and community banks had nothing to do with the financial crisis.** These are the banks that service communities and sectors that high finance regularly avoids. They did not have capital markets desks that traded MBS or speculated in OTC derivatives. They were focused on lending to mom and pop shops and helping fund their local communities in rural, more agriculture focused areas. For example, over 50% of small business loans made in the US were serviced by these community and regional banks and over 70% of agriculture loans were issued by regional banks. These banks only hold **20**% of the total capital in the financial sector. These banks focus on places that JP Morgan and Goldman don't give a shit about. 

Regulations were killing small banks' ability to compete and were leading to a rapid concentration of wealth among the biggest banks; 

JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, etc. 

Regulators and researchers feared that having most of the wealth in the country concentrated in these banks would lead to increased wealth inequality as the regional and community banks were the only banks available in low-income communities, historically disenfranchised communities, and agricultural communities that did not have access to these financial giants.

The regulations crippled small banks' ability to compete with large banks in a number of ways: One is that the vast number of regulatory compliance that Dodd-Frank enacted required massive compliance departments and legal teams that banks like JP Morgan could stomach the costs for, while a smaller bank would be completely gutted by. For example, hiring just two compliance officers **reversed** the profitability of a smaller bank. 

JP Morgan has over **4 trillion** in assets. *A smaller regional bank would have less than 1% of that.*

The SVB debacle was caused by rising interest rates making the bank's HTM securities hit badly; SVB wasn't trading Dogecoin or some other random nonsense; it was holding GOVERNMENT bonds. This was a Black Swan Event not caused by simple deregulation, but rather a lack of analysis by the government and poor management by the bank caused by a decade of low rates and optimism. SeekingAlpha and short seller Marc Cohodes rang the alarm on SVB months ago, why did the government not step in a long time ago, isn't that their job? 

LCR requirements were on banks of over $75 billion in assets, shouldn't their liquidity coverage ratio have triggered alarm bells for regulators? Other risk-based capital ratios were also required and SVB was not going under the radar as it WAS a category 3 bank. **This was not a regulatory failure.** 

The SVB case would be an entirely different post, looking at their HTM portfolio, balance sheet, and how it created a prisoner's dilemma in which Peter Thiel would trigger a bank run. It wasn't a 2008 situation where the bank did some goofy NINJA loans nonsense and went under. 

Big banks WANT regulators to pass more bills and restrictions on regional banks; it hurts their competition and makes capital flee to the big banks. Hurting commercial and regional banks hurts the little guy, and in many ways it might even hurt you, dear reader.

The powers that be in DC and on Wall Street want Regional Banks to fail for their own benefit,"What if the powers that be (Wall St. Big Whigs, the Federal Reserve and beneficiary politicians) want Regional Banks to fail so it's easier for National Banks to eventually take down Local Banks?

People who complain about reposts on subreddits are more painful than reposts,"I am excluding the bot-catchers in this. The people and bots that highlight automated repost bots are providing a public service and that’s good. 

What I mean is on the larger random-post subs like r/NextFuckingLevel  or r/IdiotsInCars  or whatever there is very often a top comment that is “I thought it was my turn to post this” or “This is the third time this week” or something. 

These comments serve no purpose. Either people have seen the previous posts, in which case your comment doesn’t do anything or they haven’t in which case they’re redundant. 

There is an edge case where these comments may cause a poster to check more carefully before submitting a post. But even so, a lot of people don’t browse specific subreddits but rather rely on their subscription feed. Reposts are good - or certainly ok - for these users because they can just scroll past stuff they’ve already seen and they’re less likely to miss good stuff that they haven’t seen. 

In conclusion, these repost hounds who leave comments moaning on popular posts are just - ironically - creating repetitive content and providing no significant benefit to offset the harm they cause. Goddamnit.",,,,,,,,
Relying on citations and studies ruins discussion,"To be clear, I'm more specifically referring to discussion about topics related to politics, economics, social issues, etc. I'm not saying citations and studies are completely worthless in these areas, like if you are writing a research paper, you obviously need to have these things. I'm more so talking about general discussions. There are a number of issues with relying on citations and studies. 

(1) No matter how hard academia tries to pretend these subjects are scientific, they just aren't. Attempts to use the scientific method for the humanities is honestly kind of a joke. For one, the studies conducted in these fields aren't always concrete or reliable. They are often heavily flawed in the methodology and can pretty easily be manipulated by biasses and agendas. Data can also pretty easily be misrepresented and misinterpreted. Generally speaking, people don't form their opinions on these topics based on studies. Rather, they form their opinions and then look for anything that confirms their bias. 

(2) The majority of people who use citations and studies in more casual discussions are disingenuous in how they go about it. They don't do deep dives into these studies and really analyze them properly. Usually, they just look for something on Google and spam the link. In reality, it takes hours and hours of labor to actually properly understand a study, and nobody is actually going to do this in a casual discussion. Not the people who are providing the citation, nor the people who are being provided to. 

(3) It's just not persuasive. When it comes to more casual discussions, throwing a bunch of links at people is never going to actually change anyone's view or genuinely persuade someone. Logic, rhetoric, personal experience, etc. are much more persuasive. It's fine if you want to incorporate some statistics into your argument, but you need the other things to actually get through to people. Simply saying, ""ahkshually, this study says...."" serves no purpose other than an attempt to one up somebody and likely annoy them. There's a reason why most politicians don't just get in front of a podium and give voters a reading list of academic peer reviewed studies. 

(4) It's just boring. A discussion that devolves into a Google search contest isn't engaging or interesting.",,,,,,,,
Society shouldn't view that real girlfriends are better than waifus as it creates gender inequality,"&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

You get to choose what she's like

She can be your motivation

She won't reject you

Won't cheat

Cons:

Rejection

Most girls expect you to be a mind reader

She can cheat on you

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a Waifu &gt; Gf post, rather I listed out the pros/cons as an outline for what I'm about to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

People often make the argument that a waifu, a fictional character in your imgination can't do real life stuff with you. 

All your ""Pros"" are essentially something that you imagine is a common argument I seen. 

However the claim ""Real girls are better than waifus because with a real girl you can have a ""real"" connection. 

Many people while making that claim don't realize that their warrant is ""Real life things are more important than digital things."" 

Have you guys, who say that claim ever considered the reality, versus the digital world?  


In real life, you have no control

Girls in real life are playing the digital world game. They're the one choosing while you're the one chasing.

What I'm trying to say is, in society men don't get the choice. Once you go into a digital world, you \*experience\* what a girl experiences in real society. It becomes much easier to date whoever you want which is what a girl experiences. 

Essentially, your warrant falls apart because in reality, you're playing the game but digitally you're the game's master. 

Girl's are inherently the game's master when it comes to dating, they have the rules, they have the ability to change it. People say waifus are bad because realistically they don't want girls to lose the title of being the Game's master. Once men start to prefer wiaifus over ""real gfs"" girls switch places, they will become a player while boys become the Game's master. 

In the age of equality between gender, we should no longer give females all the admin powers in dating. When society starts to accept waifus as a legitimate relationship it will help us achieve the equality in dating we been looking for. GIrls should have a standard to compete for, and waifus are perfect. Society might not accept the truth yet, but the fact is that men spend thousands on Gacha games just for waifus, rather than on a real girl.",,,,,,,,
we should not be blaming Tems for obscuring people's views at the Oscars with her dress.,"Social media was crazy this morning blaming Tems for her huge dress which may have blocked the views of people behind her. And people are being really aggressive about it on Reddit and Twitter. This aggression, in my opinion, is unfounded. What's more, I think it is premature to blame her at all. Here's my reasoning:

1) If she was given the design beforehand, there is no reason to assume that she knew better. This is her first year being well known, whereas previously she was an unknown musician from Africa. I don't know anyone who has ever worn a dress that has a collar higher than their head. It's not exactly a common thing. So would the average person be able to immediately see from a design that that would be obstructing someone's view? Hard to say. Especially if you are not used to wearing performative pieces and going to events like that. If you were exceptionally tall, or usually wear hats, then maybe you would think of it. But as it stands, I have yet to be convinced that the average person would anticipate this.


2) Once she got the dress, if she noticed it was too large, that would have been too late. For the most part, actresses do not wear dresses that they own to the Oscars. They sign a contract with a designer to showcase a dress. Often these dresses cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make. So at that point she couldn't have just not worn it and could even have been sued for doing so. 

3) Lastly, some people have commented online that Tems should have pushed the dress down or changed seats. You don't know if either of those were actual options. Changing seats probably would have been impossible for an event like that, and pushing the dress down could have damaged it. Plus, it's not even clear that the people behind her even _mentioned_ to her that they could not see. That is just pure speculation at this point",,,,,,,,
TikTok is more detrimental than beneficial to nursing as a whole.,"TikTok has since it’s inception been more detrimental to nursing as a career than helpful in my personal opinion. I understand that devils advocate will utilize the educational TikToks but other platforms are more helpful in education (YouTube) as they offer more time to go in depth over concepts. The disadvantages far outweigh the benefits. As someone who’s spent over a decade trying to advocate nursing as a career; seeing those in overly tight scrubs acting dramatic; doing dances ect seems more like a desperate cry for attention than wayward nurses trying to connect. Influencer culture as a whole is toxic and gives adults and children completely unrealistic outlooks on what’s acceptable and unacceptable in and out of the workplace. It’s profoundly challenging to tell society respect me for my mind; then a new grad doesn’t wear underwear while twerking on the clock. It’s hard to tell patients to respect us when we act like children talking about Icks in OB, crying over a patient dying for clout in the ICU or making fun of pediatric GSW patients. All 3 of these scenarios were nationally and some internationally publicized. I really want to know why nurses aren’t more critical about their colleagues filming TikToks that damage the career as a whole. I think we need to hold ourselves and peers more accountable for society’s perspective on us. Any to those saying they’ll judge anyway; why actively give and condone more fuel for the fire?",,,,,,,,
People make too big of a deal about tipping culture,"I get it, you’re already spending seven dollars on a coffee but if you’re doing that you probably have a dollar or two more to spare, however that’s not even my main point.

So often I hear people saying, “tipping culture has gotten out of hand.” I don’t agree with capitalism or the way we currently treat service workers and agree that businesses should 100% foot the bill to pay employees a living wage. However, that is not the system we currently live under and in the real world today, most service workers do not make a living wage and rely heavily on tips.

Here’s my thing; nobody is making you tip. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But it irks me when people are anti-tip but try to spin it into being a workers rights thing. No, you’re not tipping because you believe employers should pay their workers more and you think they deserve a living wage. You’re not tipping because you simply don’t want too. That’s fine, but don’t try to make it sound like you are some kind of pro-worker amazing person. When you don’t tip a server you are essentially screwing them over in the current system because nobodies rising up to change how restaurants pay them. 

I get it more for other businesses but again, nobodies making you tip. I think it’s good that more businesses are offering tip options. Should it be necessary? No. But in the system we live under I think it’s great that there’s an option, option being the key word, for a barista or cashier to make a dollar or two more during a transaction. 

If you feel like it do it, if you don’t then don’t. But when people just outright dismiss tipping as a whole it makes me think you just don’t want to feel guilty for not doing it and you put that higher than the positives it can bring for the worker. I think it’s good in todays system for there to be an option for people to make a little more money.",,,,,,,,
Progressives and LGBT people are just as fanatical and dogmatic as evangelicals and conservatives.,"Much of the debate/culture war on Reddit and elsewhere seems to be between pro-LGBT progressives and evangelical Christian conservatives. However, it seems to me that many progressives claim to be ideologically neutral and base their beliefs on science. But science only tells us facts about how biology and chemistry function, science doesn't tell us how to think or feel about anything. I've got the argument several times that I ought to be an LGBT ally because science. Science doesn't dictate what political causes or ideology I support.

I keep mentioning LGBT because it seems that if you're not religious nowadays then your sexuality and gender identity that defines you. Why? Why is that so important? Isn't that arbitrarily dogmatic?

Like isn't the attitude of ""thou shalt be an affirming ally"" or ""thou shalt be pro-choice"" just as dogmatic as an actual religious commandment. Why do I owe anyone solidarity? Is there some kind of pro-LGBT deity I don't know about?

Also, if there us no God or deities, then why should I have any morals? What is right and wrong then? Arbitrary cultural concepts. One nation's taboo is another nation's normal. It's not like there's a good or bad afterlife to worry about.

Speaking of afterlife, my last point of contention is that modern progressivism is like the secular equivalent of Calvinism. People who are a part of some oppressed group are among the ""saved"" and those who are not allies ought to be ""damned"" through social scorn and maybe doxxing their workplace and blacklisting them from finding another job.",,,,,,,,
Both Political Parties are Equally Responsible for the Division in America and We Need More Civil Conversation,"I would like to first clarify that I identify as an independent. And no, before someone else says it, I am not just a Republican who wants to skip church and smoke weed. For me, it’s more about recognizing that we are all multifaceted individuals with unique experiences and opinions that can not be defined by a single word.

We live in a society where disagreement is inevitable. It is perfectly normal to have different beliefs, values, and ideas about the world. However, it is becoming increasingly common to see people resorting to personal attacks and demonizing those with different opinions, and I find that unacceptable. This does not foster healthy discussions and debates, but instead only fuels division and animosity towards one another.

There is a great divide in this country. It seems as though nearly every post I read on social media creates a narrative about how the other side is evil, corrupt, and driven by sinister motives. It is important to understand everyone has a unique set of experiences that shape their opinions and beliefs. The reality is that we are all human beings who believe we are doing what is right.

Republicans call Democrats unintelligible socialists who want to destroy America. Democrats call Republicans heartless insurrectionists who want to destroy America. It is important to recognize there is a broad spectrum of political ideologies, not two groups of people who fit into a stereotype. No matter which side you voted for, half of the country disagrees. I can assure you from my experience as an American, half of the country is not evil. The truth is that we all are just people. People who care about our family, friends, neighbors, and country.

Even when we disagree with one another, it does not make the other side bad people. We need to show civility in our approach to changing the perspectives of others, even to the people who hold views we find abhorrent. Vilifying people who hold different opinions only serves to further entrench our differences and diminish our opportunities to solve problems.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the complex problems we have in this country. Having civil conversations is the only way to gain a better understanding of each other’s perspectives. It allows us to explore the nuance of these issues, find common ground, and identify where compromise is possible. When our beliefs are being attacked, it is easy to become frustrated and angry. But a willingness to learn with an open mind may help us realize that our disagreements are not as irreconcilable as we first thought. We may have more in common than we realize.

Let me end with this: When was the last time you had a civil conversation with someone you disagreed with? When was the last time you listened to what they had to say, rather than just waiting for your turn to speak? For many of us, I suspect it has been a while. Not everyone will be willing to hear you out, but we should still strive to engage in productive conversations that promote understanding and mutual respect.

It's important to clarify that my intention is not to promote tolerance towards racism, homophobia, misogyny, or xenophobia. Rather, I believe that we should work towards changing these harmful perspectives but do so in a way that does not involve attacking or demonizing individuals who hold these views. The Civil Rights Movement, Women’s Suffrage and Rights Movements, 1920’s Labor Movement and LGBTQ+ Rights Movement all found some success through peaceful protest and conversations. People can change their minds, but only if you allow them an opportunity to.",,,,,,,,
I think that the existence of closed spaces exclusively for people of a marginalized identity is not inherently a bad thing.,"There is this ongoing discourse about the existence of closed spaces for members of specific marginalized communities and a lot of progressives will say this is “self-segregation” or regressive. Let me say that I know there are people who, because of trauma or past experiences or honestly because sometimes people are just shitty, are way too eager to turn the tables and exclude the people groups who previously excluded them and I agree that insofar as that is the motivation, it is not something I support.

However, there are plenty of legitimate reasons why marginalized people would want to have spaces primarily or even exclusively designed to cater to their needs and shared experiences because the wider world is still not safe for them. 

People from more mainstream identities (read: cis/het and white) may get legitimately upset by feeling excluded (exclusion is an ugly feeling), but they inhabit a world that is mostly built to cater to their needs and shared experiences so it’s not like they don’t have anywhere else to belong. Plus, a lot of times these spaces will welcome people outside their in-group so long as the guests don’t take up too much physical or emotional space in them. Maybe the most I am willing to sympathize with their perspective is that closed spaces not be intentionally hurtful when establishing and protecting boundaries.

I think a lot of the discomfort from (mostly) white, cis/het progressives is that they are afraid that bigots could use similar rationalizations to try to re-establish whites-only, or straights-only spaces or whatever, but truth is:

1) these things already exist (how many Black people do you see at country clubs, or how many gay people can be themselves openly at evangelical churches?) 

And

2) marginalizing someone because of their identity is NOT the same as having a space that caters to people who share a common experience of marginalization.",,,,,,,,
"Our economic system cares about maximum profits only , there are byproducts such as declining mental health, social/cultural isolation which are still not being taken seriously enough due to this willful ignorance","If our economic system cared about people, why does it let the homeless die, it seems people are getting poor again in the last few years, inflation's up again, you know the drill. But how far will inflation and other systems go to keep you poor? Bet on it. Will capitalism in 50 years look better or worse than today? I think worse. Everything seems to be going downhill, every generation that is coming after the next is fucked. FUBAR. There's no direction to this crazy train we're born on. It could go any number of ways but the trend is a downward spiral of traumatic mental health that either goes unnoticed and/or costs your entire salary to cure, which doesn't even cure it, just a cope. Therapy is what $300 a session? How many of these sessions of ""talking"" do I need before I'm cured? Oh 9999?

Our bastardized version of ""crony capitalism"" is this terrible invention that has brought about such misery. Depths of mental strain that is inconceivable in any other point in history. At least if you were born in 1700 you could die quickly of disease. But today we live longer, and die on the inside, we die for decades at a time. Sitting in our fancy cars, gridlocked on the freeway, every single day. To go to work for a job we don't like and get paid barely enough to get by.

Humanity doomed itself the moment it accepted slavery as a viable concept,"It's my opinion that humanity is doomed to fail at some point. If you look at it as a game, we lost the moment we decided slavery was okay in any form, but especially in a systemic form. There are ways to achieve and construct things by treating people fairly and not using others as machines or animals. Slavery showed human's darkest instincts and behaviors. These things are clearly still in us and it's why we won't ever conserve this planet to our benefit or even escape it to another. Racism is just one issue, but it's more about the lack of trust we have in each other. The damage caused by slavery is still felt today and it becomes part of our identity because these instincts somehow still live in us. We would have to permanently transcend our darkest impulses to ascend to a sustainable existence of peace and trust, but when trust is broken it can often never be rebuilt.",,,,,,,,
Religion should be a private matter,"CMV: Religion should be a private matter

If you are in public office and use your faith to back bills or make laws based off of your faith you should be chastised and voted out. We let children believe in fairy tales but we dont let them dictate our lives with their childish beliefs; so why do we allow grown adults to dictate our lives with their fairy tales? 

Politics and religion in the modern era do not go together. You can look at all the ultra religious states and their leaders and look at how they rank in comparison to areas with less religions. Look at entire countries who are dominated by fanatics. Their education rankings are just through the roof! Thats why those countries suffer from Brain Drain.

Stay out of my dm’s too, the only reason you are apart of your current religion is purely geographical and time related. If you were born somewhere else you would be apart of a different faith and if you has the mistake of being born before jesus then surprise you are burning in hell, but dont worry; its a special spot in hell for the “just”.  Sick of listening to this on political commentary shows/radio/podcast/politicians.

"It doesn't matter which economic or political system we use to try to manage humanity and civilisation. So long as there are humans involved, we will corrupt it.","There is no such thing as a perfect (or likely even near perfect) system for the governance of human populations which is directly managed by humans that doesn't become significantly corrupt over time. 

I have had many arguments with people who believe that communism would be a better system for managing large populations but what these people never seem to take into account is that so long as it is a system managed by humans, it will inherently lean towards corruption to one degree or another. 

I believe the best system we can create is one that manages to dissipate the negative impacts of centralised power, thus creating a society that leans towards corruption as little as possible, while also recognising that regardless of what system we implement, this tendency will always be there so long as the system is run by humans. 

Case in point, I feel like democracy and capitalism do a reasonably good job of achieving this. It distributes elective power to the people while also distributing economic power through free markets. Yet what we see happening now is the corruption of this system due to the consolidation of political choice due to very limited party choices in most western countries along with economic consolidation caused by corporatism which is rapidly taking over capitalism. 

I believe a possible, if highly risky, solution to this is to allow highly intelligent AI to manage our political and economic systems as this takes humans mostly out of the question. But of course, which humans program the AI and give it its aims and goals then becomes the issue, yet this solution, I believe, still has the best possibility of helping humans to thrive as a species.",,,,,,,,
Being transgender doesn't make any sense.,"It's not rooted in reality. For you to change gender from man to woman, you must have some kind of what man and woman are. If man and woman isn't measured by the biological markers, then how are you measuring it? What exactly are you transitioning into if you can't accurately describe what a man or a woman is by a set of fundamental characters and attributes? What's even the point of identifying as a man or a woman if there is no distinct differences between the two? Are they the same thing? If no, then how would you describe either man or woman?

If you're gay, let's say a man, you're attracted to men not woman, and vice versa for lesbians. And if you're straight, you're attracted to the opposite sex. Is this true? If so, there must be a difference between man and woman that is measurable. So, I believe you are either one or the other and you can't truly change that. Change my veiw. Thankyou. I am open and willing to learn, dispute how you have probably already judged me.",,,,,,,,
Protesting against drag show for kids on its own doesn't makes you a Nazi.,"I am angry. Angry that the conversation about drag shows for kids has been reduced to a black and white discussion of either supporting them or being labeled a Nazi. It's not that simple. There are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed, and it's unfair to dismiss them as merely rooted in transphobia.

1.Let's start with the fact that children are not capable of fully comprehending adult themes and concepts. Drag shows are meant to be subversive and push boundaries, but that doesn't mean they're appropriate for kids. As adults, we have a responsibility to recognize that some activities are age-appropriate, and drag shows don't fall into that category. It's not about hating or fearing trans people; it's about protecting children's development and well-being.

2. I have is the exploitation of children for political purposes. I worry that some individuals are using drag shows aimed at children as a way to indoctrinate them into certain beliefs and ideologies. This is not okay. Children should be allowed to develop their own beliefs and values, not be forced into a particular ideology. It's a form of child abuse to impose political views on them.

3.safety is a legitimate concern. Drag shows can attract individuals who might not have the best intentions towards children. Allowing children to attend such events could put them at risk of encountering predators or other dangerous individuals(you know who I mean but I don't think that p word is allowed here). It's our responsibility as adults to protect children from harm, and allowing them to attend events that could put them in harm's way is not acceptable.

Labeling those who voice these concerns as Nazis or bigots is unfair and unhelpful. It's important to have open and honest discussions about these issues without resorting to name-calling or insults. We need to acknowledge that there are legitimate worries about the safety, well-being, and development of children when it comes to drag shows for kids. It's not a simple matter of either supporting them or not.

That's not to say I agree with what the right side is doing. They are explicitly against drag show for all kids. I don't agree with that. I can understand if you think that your child would expand their horizon by witnessing diverse community like drag shows.lets say The same way you have reasons to show your kids in the drag show i have reasons to not. I however am not against what you do with your ward and i expect the same from you.",,,,,,,,
The new prevalence of remote work is bad for anybody who doesn't WFH,"I live in North Idaho, in a city that used to be almost entirely blue collar. Rural lifestyle, conservative politics, all that. It's always been a bit of a resort town, and then a few years ago a huge number of celebrities bought vacation homes here and drove thousands of people to move here.

I'll preface the rest of this by saying I am *not* a Conservative and my ideology aligns with very few of my neighbors. I'll also say that while I'm specifically talking about my city, this has happened to any notable city in the West, including Montana, Wyoming, Utah, smaller cities in Washington and Oregon, and so on.

In my area, there's always been a general dislike among locals towards people who move in from other states, namely California, Washington, and Oregon. A lot of that dislike was/is based in the idea that people from blue states would somehow corrupt Idaho's politics, which wasn't, and isn't, the case.

The other reason people have been wary of outsiders is because we know they're bringing big money with them. Even before the pandemic, people were selling their homes in California and building McMansions worth five times the median home price here. Obviously that helps the economy of the city and state, but it has driven a huge increase in the wealth gap here for over a decade. 

However, it wasn't a *significant* problem until 2020, when the widespread adoption of work from home policies led droves of people to move to more ""affordable"" cities, especially those with excellent outdoor access and reasonable proximity to bigger cities. I'm sure part of that is driven by the new-ish trendiness of ""wellness"" and the general fetishization of the aesthetics of outdoor, healthy life. There's a cryotherapy spot downtown now, a few vitamin IV places, countless juice bars, and *so much yoga.* I'm not saying I hate these things, but nobody I know who's from here is into that stuff. I also don't hate the people who move here - I totally understand (and unfortunately now empathize with) the idea of moving to a more affordable city.

Anyway, my rent has literally doubled since the pandemic. My parents' house's value doubled. Hotels were booked out because people trying to move here were waiting for a home to buy or rent. Several friends and coworkers were priced out of the city (population 55,000, I might add). Property taxes have become untenable for some. The second an older home goes on the market, it's bought and flipped. There's no opportunity for upward mobility for almost any local. There's no affordable city to move to within a few hundred miles, because people from here fled to them and most of them were equally affected by the crisis.

I know that work from home isn't the sole reason for the housing crisis (which has affected most of the US), but I strongly believe it has played a leading role in the problems we now face. People like myself, my family, my friends, my neighbors, who used to be able to lead a comfortable, affordable life, have been squeezed out of the middle class (which, I know, has been shrinking for decades) to the point of near-poverty. The income gap here is unbelievable now, and I'm sure it's the same in many other cities. Remote work made up 61% of work in 2020, and now sits at 29%.",,,,,,,,
Being popular in high school / college is actually important,"Sometimes, I hear people saying stuff like high school / college popularity doesn't matter in the real world. I honestly think this is copium from people who weren't popular. Obviously, there are some people who peaked in high school or college, and others who were losers that end up becoming successful later in life. However, generally speaking, being popular is an important part of development and learning, and you are missing out if you weren't one of the popular kids. 

First of all, generally speaking, popularity comes from having good traits, such as being attractive, having good social skills, having a good personality, being good at sports, being funny, whatever. Being popular in high school and college is like the equivalent of smart kids getting good grades. It's a reward for doing well in certain areas. 

Second of all, being popular is an important part of development. You honestly learn a lot by having a ton of friends and an active social life when you are younger. It helps you develop even better social skills, which will continue to help you out later on in life. The earlier you start developing these skills, the better and more experienced you will be going forward. 

Third, it's helpful to start building a social circle and network of people you know early on in life. Even though you will drift apart with people over the years, it still provides a good foundation if you get the ball rolling early. The more people you know, the easier it becomes to meet new people. It's like a snowball effect. You start off by being popular in high school and college, and you will continue meeting more new people and making new connections than you would have otherwise. Even if you end up with completely different friend groups later on, it all traces back to having a lot of friends early on. Plus, in many cases, friends you made back in high school and college often become lifelong friends. 


Fourth, it just makes those years more fun in general. High school and college are some of the easiest places to make friends, and it's at a time in life where you most likely aren't a parent yet, and most of the people you know aren't parents yet. This is a great time to just have fun and enjoy it. Later on in life, people usually become busier, less available, plus more worn down in general. 

Overall, I'm sick of hearing some people pretend that popularity in high school / college isn't important. Obviously, grades are important too, but popularity is just as if not more important than getting good grades. As long as your grades are decent enough, you're good. Getting a 4.0 but not having a social life isn't that great. Getting like a 3.4 or something, but actually having a big social life is a much more valuable academic experience.",,,,,,,,

trans and women,"I can be and am supportive of the LGB community, and fine with transgender adults living as they like, but not ok at all with transgender ""women"" saying they're women. They're not. Makeup, clothes, even surgery are physical manifestations of individual lived experiences as a girl and woman. I don't want men and men's parts in my spaces reserved for women. I don't want to change with a naked guy in the locker room. I'm modest, and am not amending my habits to subordinate to him. Competitive sports that women have fought for equality in via title 9 should NOT be shared with men who've undergone puberty and then change gender. Come on. Take one look at Lia Thomas to see why. I don't want trans people teaching my little kids if they are going to speak about their agenda at all in class - which appears to be something all TG people like to do, have their gender identity as the main topic. I don't want sex and gender in grades k-6. And I'm not referring to myself as anything other than a woman. Period.",,,,,,,,
"Post-materialist political behavior is self-defeating, mis-directed rage against the machine, and will ultimately be viewed by future historians as a regressive social phenomenon.","Disclaimer: I am, in the spirit of the sub, presenting the most hard-line, shorthand version of the position. 

With that out of the way:

I posit that the steady subversion of traditional ""bread and butter"" political cleavages (in which lines are drawn largely along economic interests) by contemporary [post-materialist](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/54294170/j.1559-1816.1996.tb00085.x20170830-2804-1lttpw9-libre.pdf?1504128721=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DIngleharts_Materialism_Postmaterialism_C.pdf&amp;Expires=1678658213&amp;Signature=e~269xTD1XLfBXogcCRoXQgjOV4lWIqb8UsAs51ERckUh96p0m61mosJNF3pTynrMfish42A~N1r3QFdT-SZ4Y98QZ6mBYquvJzQjtptfafjjXcvfTd0siat~PP92wmABVNpIRkuw6P-QNLkNem4Hpx~y6QdPpL94DUnJyNhvuSqQP6zp69iAf4We6SQV06WGXVRH0yhXpIZm9NjCWeV1KU1UlOdB2OH3sUbw5gr30Tt8jZ6r5k7o7BqxttYEVtVZwa0r7FRWUq7Oj0RBDjBFyI11qcUZ9zUxoUoMX1~pvhqaZ4AHL2-UpBxHXYgoUvNd3o9558fn8rZoJvI9MCd9w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA), identitarian, values-based politics ultimately detracts from the debates that matter in an essentially zero-sum fashion. By directing political attention toward social fractures and neglecting systemic rot and economic issues pertaining to material conditions and democratized public welfare, participants are perpetuating the very conditions of uncertainty which till fertile ground for the sowing of social division and group in-fighting to begin with.

The primacy of post-material political identities allows political and economic elites/entities to continue engaging in transitively reciprocal activities (commonly referred to as ""influence-market-style corruption"") without citizen oversight or attention, and creates an environment where political capital can be won with ideological window-dressing rather than by demonstrating integrity of representation or even minimal competency at pushing for actual progress.

Obviously, this view is heavily vested in some utilitarian/quasi-Rawlsian thought, and more broadly in the basic assertion that social progress follows economic conditions (hell, everyone from Adams to Marx made this point in some capacity), but also in more idealist notions about social cohesion and the habituation of shared norms as being critical to the health of the polity. Additionally, it rests on more contemporary conceptions of racial/identity-based tensions as a illusion of projected, superficial divisions over what is, under the surface, [a class hierarchy or caste system.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/magazine/isabel-wilkerson-caste.html)

In broad strokes, my argument is this: If voters, and citizens more generally, would focus on and vote according to their checkbooks and holding the power-literate accountable rather than engaging in superfluous social infighting, they'd actually get to their value-based goals more efficiently. In a context where government is forced to uphold its end of the social contract, the resulting gains in material conditions, solutions of coordination and collective action dilemmas, increased stability of economic welfare, and reduction in the accelerant tensions of scarcity and disparity would allow for the freer and more efficient sharing of social norms and ultimately greater tolerance, acceptance, and mutual dignity (most romantically, a beautifully diverse, yet deeply unified, shared identity). 

Please make an argument either for the utility of contemporary post-materialist politics, against the power of general welfare to smooth out social cleavages, some combination thereof, or catch me in one of the 7 other holes that are in my argument.",,,,,,,,
I'm a real life mascot.,"You know, that pretty looking dude who cracks jokes and that everyone around even patpats on the head, genuinely likes to have around, invites to parties and other things friends invite friends to go? Someone who gives a good vibe and people cherish when they're around?

That's me.

Perhaps it's because my social circles nearly have no single girls, but I think i'm seen as a mascot. Childish, potentially. But people like me. So i'm a mascot. Everyone is dating except for me. I'm often jealous of my friends who have nice girls to build a life together. I've given up on sex totally - with guys or girls. I'm bisexual. It doesn't interest me anymore after years of not having anything at all, not even a kiss, and when I was lucky, it was a mess because I ended up with people with no experience like me and it was just messy due to the lack of experience of us both and therefore not satisfying to neither.

What do I have to do? Get a sign on my head that says ""i'm single""?

Having children is selfish.,"A) Human consciousness can be painful in the world as it functions today, there are so many unsolvable sicknesses in human culture. These issues are unsolvable because there are simply too many people in the world that would need to cooperate and understand and respect each other. Humans were absolutely not equipped to become so populated. We have people feeling isolated, unfulfilled, manipulated. We can’t connect with how many people are actually involved in the structure of our way of life. The network of function is too big. Ideas are strongly divided because our realities are strongly different. 
I don’t see that improving anytime soon.

B) Overpopulation contributes to many social, economical, environmental, and mental damages.
I recognize that many people have children simply for the experience of raising a family, it’s what we were created to do, biologically, to love and to create and to build beautiful memories. But this is what seems selfish to me, choosing your own version of happiness over the improvement of the world.

"Politicians, the news Media, and even social media mods do not do enough to remind people that disliking/hating a foreign government should not be applied to citizens of those nations.","I am Chinese. I came here when I was two and grew up in this country. I went to school here. I work here. I pay my taxes. I do my part as a human of this planet to give back to charities and organizations that better the community, the world, and the earth.

What I am currently seeing by way of political rhetoric is that China is bad. And I recognize the US and China have had economic competition for decades but it seems now things are more tense than ever. I see it both from the left and the right. On Reddit, I often see 'fuck china' this and 'fuck china' that - even for non-political posts. It's pretty intense.   


Given the political climate, and angry rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum, along with some of the shit I have seen on Reddit, it has created some level of anxiety in me - both for traveling purposes and just being more apprehensive about acknowledging a part of me that is outside my control. I guess we generally use 'fuck (country)' colloquially to mean fuck that country's govt but now it seems that phrase has expanded to create a suspicion and hatred towards Asians.

I've travelled to different parts of the country and in predominantly white states, I get stares but I have not explicitly experienced any racism or prejudice - so far. That being said, I am a bit more apprehensive and cautious more than ever about traveling to certain parts of this country due to the rise of Asians being targeted with assault, etc, so it's definitely happening.

I'd like to think most Americans can separate hatred of the Chinese govt from Chinese citizens or Chinese people living in this country but I am not always confident in American exceptionalism due to some of the angry rhetoric I have seen in the news and media. Culturally, I am assimilated into the American experience with minimal exposure even to my own background, but no matter what I say or do, I ultimately have no control over my physical ethnic traits and how strangers might perceive me based on their own political views.

I fear that the lack of constant reminders from the news, politicians, social media platforms, means more people will blur the line or end up holding irrational prejudices against Chinese people - especially in America where people sometimes struggle with separating personal political values from an individual - sometimes even deliberately targeting Asians due to one's own political views. Even if one does not personally hate Chinese people, using language like 'Fuck China' seemingly only risks potentially extending that hatred beyond politics. We have seen this quite a bit with members of other minority groups. Since East Asians are distinctly and noticeably different compared to Caucasians, it is not easy to simply ""blend in.""

I suppose hating the CCP isn't anything new and there are many reasons to not like the CCP but with the rise of media coverage on Asian people being targeted, and politicians not seemingly doing enough to remind people to separate govt from the people, there seems to be an immediate negative reaction when people drop the word 'China' and often people can find it difficult to separate hating 'China (the govt)' from hating 'China (the people)'

My take is that both the left and right politicians are not doing enough to remind people to adopt rhetoric that might be more appropriate such as expressing hatred towards a political part instead of a country. 

Saying 'Fuck China' and 'Fuck the Chinese' seemingly encompasses the people, the culture, the good **vs** 'Fuck the Chinese Govt' or 'Fuck the CCP' 'Fuck Xi' which makes it far more clear that one's discontent is not with the people but rather only with the government.

Politicians and the news media can do more to help change the rhetoric and remind all of us to separate politics from the people. We all say we know it but it doesn't seem to be emphasized enough. I believe we should adopt an approach with the way we use our language that minimizes risks of people letting their political views against a government transfer to become prejudice or even racism against someone who might be from a certain country. Not just for China but with Iran, with Russia, or any state that we have deemed to be antithetical to America's values.

Some may argue free speech but I'd challenge these people if we can be more precise in our language if it means it can minimize potential fueling of hatred and racism, etc.

I think I’m smarter than I really am. All I do is just write halfway decent (and that’s maybe too much credit).,"This might be a bit of an odd change my view, but it’s something that I’ve been wondering about and struggling with. For this CMV, I’ll refer to conversations on Reddit since this is what got me thinking.

When it comes to expressing my opinions or ideas, I often find myself on the receiving end of a negative reaction, whether it’d be in real life or on the internet. And, often times, I find it rather strange because, many times, I agree with the person I’m talking to and describe why I do as such. But then I’m still told that I’m wrong, or on Reddit, continue to get downvoted, even with a minor disagreement. I’ve seen more incendiary takes that still get good amounts of support and positive feedback. But I often get drilled for expressing, what I think, is pretty much the same opinion, with maybe some trivial differences.

After thinking about it, I think this is because, subconsciously, I probably think I’m smarter than I really am. I use that I think best conveys my thoughts and opinions. But, in all honesty, it’s probably just a way to sound “intelligent” when making a dumb thought or opinion. I don’t do this consciously. It’s just the way I write or speak. But it seems that no one understands what I’m trying to say, and instead, try to tell me what I really think.  So, often times, I wonder “What is the source of the disagreement? Because we agree with pretty much everything, maybe just a minor point. [On Reddit] Why does this person continue to downvote me and continues on points that I didn’t even bring up?” I’ll reread over and over again what I had said and if I was being understood. But, in recent discussions on CMV, it seems that even after going through my comments and seeing that I did, indeed, tried to explain my view in the best way I could possible, I’ll still get downvoted, even when I’m 99% agreeing with the other person. Ultimately, I think this is because I’m writing I’m writing in a way that I think is both intelligent and understandable. But really, I’m just not that smart but I was trained to use big words and expressions, yet can’t connect them into coherent ideas.

Maybe I just need to stick to shorter sentences and paragraphs that are my level to being understood by others.

So, let’s see if you can change my view.",,,,,,,,
We need a wealth cap.,"It's become apparent that the rampant social experiment known as freedom of wealth has failed the majority of us, and is being used as a carrot to lead us by the nose. By setting limits on this it opens up what has been gated from most of society. When the land may not be monopolized by some oligarch, we should be able to distribute it effectively without being forced to live in these compounds called towns, and cities.

By setting a $5 million cap on individuals, as a well as, let's say three houses, and three cars/vehicles.

Excess wealth will be used to renew our society.

If we limit wealth, we limit greed.",,,,,,,,
You do not need any excuse to break up with someone,"I often hear people mad at their exes for suddenly or apparently randomly leaving, this makes no sense to me.

You are not inherently indebted to anyone else, you can leave whoever you want, end whatever relationship, for no any whatsoever. 

Members of a relationship are two separate people, with the separate rights to bodily autonomy. 

You also can't control emotions, if someone simply falls out of love with you, would you rather them stay in the relationship and pretend for your sake?

Being dumped sucks, but would you rather be with someone who doesn't want to be with you? No, so you cannot reasonably be upset with someone for leaving you.",,,,,,,,
"People should use headlights on rainy / stormy days, even in daytime. People who don't are selfish jerks.","This is a view on something that seems like common sense to me. However a lot of people in my area don't do it, so I'm wondering if maybe my view is flawed?

You should use headlights when driving on rainy / stormy days. I see people driving gray cars the blend into the road/rain with no headlights and I'm like ...what are you thinking? 

It literally involves a flick of the finger, extremely minimal effort.

Not only that but it's the law in my state,  California Vehicle Code 24400: ""You must turn on your headlights if snow, rain, fog, dust, or low visibility (1,000 feet or less) requires the use of windshield wipers""

Since all my logic and the law says to do it, I can only conclude the people who don't are selfish lazy jerks. But maybe I'm missing something?",,,,,,,,
I consider Christians to be frauds if they haven't read through the Bible at least once throughout their life.,"I've recently started reading the Bible (usually to fall asleep at night) and have made it halfway through Genesis. Whenever converse with Christians, it seems that many Christians have not delved deep into their religious text beyond simply reading scripture during Bible study. 

I am an agnostic, so I'm still exploring my own beliefs, but even if I were to believe in God, I don't think it would necessarily align with the Christian conception of a deity. Another reason I am reading through the bible is that many video games and media entertainment have religious references. For example, Assassin Creed: Odyssey and the God of War series made me more interested in studying Greek Mythology. I started to study Christian Mythology and have encountered interesting stories like Paradise Lost and the Tower of Babel, which had created a lot of insightful discussion with experienced Christians.

The Bible contains material that is fundamental to Christian belief, and it's generally considered important for Christians to read the Bible at least once in their lifetime. Many would argue that it's a crucial aspect of their faith. I estimate the Bible to be the length of about two Harry Potter novels, and many people in the world have read the Harry Potter series. 

Anyways, if they truly have faith in a deity, then why wouldn't they invest the time on learning about such deity? It doesn't make sense to me.",,,,,,,,
We should respect conspiracy theories the same way we respect religion," I say this because, both cannot be disapproved, however they don't have evidence that proves it.

Today’s Republican Party offers nothing but protection from “boogeymen” it has created,"Right now, we have serious problems in this country.  Inflation, high energy prices, the situation in Ukraine, China threatening us with war if we try to prevent it from invading Taiwan, and North Korea and Iran expanding their nuclear weapons programs. 

I have not heard the GOP’s plan for resolving any of these problems (except for gas prices - drill more!).  

Instead, they are fixated on — almost obsessed with — transgender people, pronouns, critical race theory, investigating Dr. Fauci because they think he single-handedly created a worldwide pandemic etc. 

Banning books and passing anti-woke bills does not help any of us economically. Are public schools even teaching critical race theory or are the republicans passing bills to ban things that are not real? What does it even mean to be “woke”? The bills I have seen are vague that they are practically meaningless. 

There does not seem to be any plan for addressing the “bread and butter” issues that are hurting all Americans right now. It appears the right offers nothing but political theater.

"All this AI tech is good, actually + AI art is real art.","Disclaimer: I don't think it's okay to steal art in order to build your AI. Privacy is important.

I see a bunch of CMVs about how all the new things about AI aren't that bad, implying that they think it's bad, just not \*very\* bad. Me, I think it's not bad at all. I actually think it's \*good\* and I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.

This is not the first time we see people lose their jobs or worry about losing their jobs because of new technology. It happened with the Industrial Revolution when dozens of farmhands got replaced by a single tractor, and countless of other examples out there.

It's not the first time something gets called ""not art"" because of how a machine was involved in its production. Back when photographs were new, people were malding about how photographs aren't real art, you just pressed a button and hurr durr I'm an artist. Nowadays we know better and professional photographers who do the photograph thing way better than I can exist and are paid for it. Although someone who can paint a picture manually tends to still be, to me, more impressive (when it comes to their skill) than a photographer who managed to take an outstanding picture.

See that previous paragraph? I believe AI artists work the same way. It's not easy to make AI art -- I've tried to do it and by god, is it tough. You need to choose the right words, find the right prompts, pick the right seed -- sometimes even different AIs (compare a different AI with a different camera) because NovelAI is good at a specific thing while, say, character dot ai is good at another -- and then you have to comb through several pictures. Like with being a photographer, it takes effort and it IS fascinating to see what people can do, \*even\* if manual pictures are still more impressive. ...Just like fabric, too! I love me some industrial clothings, but if my mom makes something I can buy on the store with her own hands? Holy smokes.

I don't think people losing their jobs for AI is an actual bad thing at a societal level; sure, it sucks for them and it'd suck for me if I were one of those people, but it's necessary. I'm not losing my job yet as a programmer but I eventually will, just like cars did to horses, and that's alright. Humans need not apply.",,,,,,,,
People shouldn't care so much about their gender identity,"For the record, I'm not only referring to trans and non-binary people. I'm also talking about, for example, men who are super obsessed with being manly, who make being a man such a huge part of their personal identity. Being this obsessed with gender is honestly just cringe, whether you are trans, non-binary, or cis. The idea of revolving your personality around gender identity is just kind of ridiculous. It really doesn't matter, and it's a silly thing to revolve your personality around. 

The way I see it, it doesn't really matter whether you are a male or a female, or a man or a woman or whatever, at least when it comes to your identity as a person. If I magically woke up tomorrow having the body of the opposite sex, I honestly wouldn't give a shit. I wouldn't complain about how I'm trapped in the wrong body or whatever, I'd just carry on as normal. 

Obviously, people do get treated differently and have different experiences based on their sex and/or gender, but at the end of the day, there are way more similarities than there are differences. We still eat the same food, we live in the same cities, we have access to all the same hobbies and interests, etc. It's like when you play an RPG, maybe there might be a few quests that are different for different classes, but 90% of the game is still the same either way. (For the record, I'm specifically referring to 21st-century Western countries). The differing experiences between sexes and genders aren't enough to justify revolving your personality or identity around it.",,,,,,,,

Hetero Women have just as unrealistic standards of romance as men do,"there have been many discussions and studies done on how men are affected by porn consumption. from sex addiction, to mirroring problematic behaviors, to normalizing aggressive sex. while I think the situation is not completely similar I find it interesting how little I see women examine their biases and expectations when it comes to dating.

there's no problem with preferences of course but when there are increasing concerns of low birth rates, low marriage rates, and young people having less sex than ever I think both sides should be critical about whether what they want is reasonable to expect. I'm sure there are plenty of women who want completely doable things in their relationships but how many women unknowingly are ruining their romantic lives trying to live up to some idealized version of romance that doesn't exist outside of fiction? 

especially when you consider the onus is still primarily on men to engage and push romantic relationships forward it's just exhausting to constantly be trying to gauge what the person sees as romantic or what they want out of a partner when I know the standards are so skewed towards perfect men who are charming, confident, assertive, and masculine in all the right ways while perfectly avoiding any and all red flags that simply come from living in a patriarchy. And of course the women in question are free to ghost and ignore anyone not to their standards, inadvertently making the problem worse as they continually reduce their dating pools looking for a perfect man that doesn't exist. even lesbians have noted how difficult it is to date women for presumably similar reasons.

this is by no means a woman hating post nor is it an excuse for men to be emotionally unintelligent or manipulative but i genuinely feel there's a huge gap in expectations that ruins many relationships. men, do you find this to be true in your circles/relationships? women, do you feel your standards have been unknowingly shifted due to all the romance media we have created? are women aware of how exhausting it is to be a man trying to live up to these ""reasonable"" standards?",,,,,,,,
there is no argument that sufficiently overrides a students rights explaining why a student(in the USA) must recite the pledge of allegiance.,"im going to start by addressing some of the primary arguments for it

1. its to honor people who died for you/ your country.

the students in no way likely compelled or asked said people(soldiers) to die or fight in a war. additionally most wars in modern history fought by the us have not been fought for the sovereignty or preservation of the USA as a country but rather for political gain and posturing. compounding this the student in question(assuming they are a k-11) has no ability to directly change political policy or if a war is fought or not. lastly the person in question could have easily have been born anywhere else and did not willingly decide to be born in a specific country or location.

2. its respectful

it is inherently disrespectful to mandate that a student say any set of words or phrases against their will especially if they are of a different religion and do not agree with the under god part of the pledge of allegiance. to further back this claim the pledge of allegiance is allegedly a symbol of american values/policies like ""freedom and the constitution, given that the constitution contains the first amendment its disrespectful and mocking to the student to utilize such a symbol as a method of depriving said student of the rights said symbol represents.

lastly punishing students for not reciting it is essentially punishing a thought crime.",,,,,,,,
"Nurture has a much bigger effect on people than Nature, on all aspects of life.","This has been a topic of interest for a very long time &amp; have been researching it for a while. When I say ""research"" I mean watching documentaries on serial killers upbringing. Listening to neural scientists &amp; psychologists speak about their experience/opinions on this topic and reading articles.

To be clear this topic is heavily debated in psychology/neural science. However it seems that the more modern the studies are, the more it points to environment being the biggest factor. 

Explains why almost every serial killer (if not all) has had a very troubled past. Even ones that people used to believe had a normal upbringing, like Jeffery Dahmer. Turns out after looking into what he claimed was ""normal"", was actually twisted. 

Explains why criminals of all degrees were usually forced into their life due to environmental factors (such as poverty).

Explains why in American style prisons the return rate is 76%, while in Denmark where they have much different prison environments, the return rate overall is only 27% &amp; in open prisons the return rate is 19%. Denmark figured out that if you treat people like humans/give help while in prison &amp; more importantly out of prison. Then those people are much less likely to commit crimes. 

Explains why when there was a case of identical triplets being separated at birth (documentary is called Three Identical Strangers). Even though they were all genetically identical, raised in the same country/state (which is a big deal actually), they all came out very different. I mean people were really trying to force them to seem alike &amp; even then it was clear how different they were personality wise. One of the brothers specifically was so damaged from his past, that he ended up committing suicide. 

Explains why depending on the country you were born in, that your IQ varies. I mean it varies by A LOT, even just a 15 point different in IQ is huge. Yet as it turns out, countries with IQ average above 95 are mostly wealthier nations (compared to the world). While countries that are very poor, rank low in IQ, many in the low 80/mid 70 IQ range &amp; a fair amount in the 60 range. Some countries like Nepal and couple others were in the 40 IQ range. 

Source: https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country/





Please include this specific point when providing a counter argument:

Also something that has to be explained if the belief that genetics plays a bigger role than environment. That something is the IQ gap not only in poorer countries, but minorities in America vs White people. There is a significant IQ gap between the average Black American vs a White American. If the the belief that genetics plays a bigger part than environment. Then by default the explanation for IQ gaps are due to genetics, therefore you would also have to say that minorities are less intelligent than white people genetically. 

With the big racial discrimination implications aside, I find that explanation hard to believe. Because even asian countries like Nepal scored very, very low on IQ tests, as well as African, middle eastern and so on. What those countries &amp; the minorities in America have in common is their wealth (aka environment), not genetics.

Source: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-black-white-test-score-gap-why-it-persists-and-what-can-be-done/amp/

So again, I believe that the environment plays the biggest factor in peoples outcomes, compared to their genetics. However I am always challenging my views &amp; am interested to hear why you may believe the opposite.",,,,,,,,

Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election,"I am not a fan of Donald Trump and if I had my way, neither Biden or Trump would be president. 

However, I think Trump has a very good chance of a) securing his party’s nomination and b) winning the general election in ‘24 if he runs against Biden. 

Inflation is at a 40-year high and the feds just announced they will raise interest rates again.  This hurts people who have ARMs and people who are looking to buy a home or borrow money for another large purchase.  Inflation has also taken a huge chunk out of Americans’ paychecks - effectively a pay cut because wages are not increasing at the same rate as prices. It looks like this will continue for the foreseeable future, until we are in a full-blown recession. 

This mirrors the country’s economic problems at the end of the Carter administration. Reagan absolutely stomped Carter in 1980 and Reagan ran largely on “Carter and his party put all of us in the poor house.” If you look at the electoral maps for the 1980 and 1984 elections, damn near the entire country voted for Reagan - even liberal California. 

Nobody else in the Republican Party has the popularity or name recognition that Trump has; it is unlikely that any of the other candidates could beat Trump in the primaries.  It is also highly unlikely that Trump will be indicted. Indicting a former president is something that has never been done before, and the DOJ knows it would only divide the country even more and cause a huge backlash. If anything, an indictment would probably make Trump more popular. And it would not disqualify him from running. 

I would like to think I am wrong and the GOP will run a more sane candidate, but I am not hopeful.  What am I missing?",,,,,,,,

neoclassical economics should be discarded as a field,"Neoclassical economics (econ) purports to describe how people make decisions around allocation of resources. But in both lab and real world settings it has been proven that it does not. It is therefore a broken field of inquiry, pseudo science, and should cease to be taught or researched. 

In the lab:

- copious behavioural research has demonstrated that people do not think or make decisions the way econ thinks they should. Moreover people do not behave 'as if' they were econs - the outcomes of their decisions are different.

In reality: 

- in my own field of environmental and climate economics, neoclassical assumptions have been profoundly damaging. They consistently suggest absurd decarbonisation pathways that rely on rates of land use change 3x faster than any observed in history. Such transitions are not only implausible, they are highly undesirable. The rapid pace of soybean uptake, e.g., has led led widespread spillover deforestation in the amazon. Econ denies such problems by assuming perfect policy oversight and an absence of counterproductive decisions. 

- more absurdly still, econ suggests 4degrees of warming is compatible with a growing economy, and indeed is the optimal tradeoff between costs of decarbonisation and climate damages. 4degrees of warming is borderline incompatible present day human societies. 

Therefore, neoclassical economics is not only false, but profoundly damaging, making absurd and unworkable policy recommendations in important areas of work.

A “National Divorce” would be beneficial for the United States.,"If you haven’t heard, MTG called for what she calls a “National Divorce”. Basically this would separate the red states and blue states.

While I do agree that this is part of one of MTG’s unhinged rants, I don’t think it’s a terrible idea if the US wants to improve its reputation abroad.

Many of the Americans that foreigners mock the US for come from the red states, and many of the ideas that are not aligned with those of developed nations are within the south as well, aka where the true Republican States are.

It’s true that a lot of the Western States are red too. But those states don’t hold the attitudes from diehard Republicans in the south because those from the Rockies States are moreso Libertarian.
And yes the northern Rockies do lean more right than the southern Rockies, but they are nonetheless Libertarian. (eg. Most Wyomingites don’t have a high opinion of LGBT people but do not support laws meant to discriminate against them).

The way I see it, if the US is a garden, recently it’s been infested by weeds. And a “National Divorce” is exactly what the US needs to “weed the garden”, because day by day, the problem of the weeds get worse, and the only way to get rid of the weeds is to take out the infested parts of the garden.

And maybe, the rest of the world will see that many of the attitudes that they associate with Americans are only supported by some, rather than many believing that all Americans hold such an attitude.

Morality is overrated,"First, I will clarify that everyone ought to have certain baseline levels of morality. Obviously, you should treat people with respect, don't do anything that directly harms anyone, and generally be courteous and mindful of other people. 

What I am talking about is more superficial things that people use to moral grandstand. Things like not consuming certain products for ethical reasons. Being self-righteous about certain political views and antagonizing anyone who disagrees with you. Being on a high horse about your religion. Flexing about how your career choice is noble or virtuous. Letting everyone know about your volunteer work or donating to charity. I'm sorry, but being self-righteous about these types of things is one of the most obnoxious traits someone can have.

Life is short. There is nothing wrong with only worrying about anyone other than yourself, your family, and your friends. Oh, the dairy industry is bad for the environment, and animals are mistreated? So what, burgers taste good. The IP creator of this video game has socially unacceptable opinions? Who cares? The game is fun. Your friend said some ignorant stuff while drunk? Who cares? They are fun to hang out with. There's a new protest about the new flavor of the month issue? Don't care, I'd rather just watch Netflix with my partner. New volunteer opportunities available? Don't care, I'm too lazy. Career choice contributes little to society and exploits workers? Whatever, the pay is good. Did a new charity just open up? Oh well, I'm gonna spend my money on fun stuff instead. 

The point is that there is nothing wrong with just living your life, doing stuff you enjoy, and not caring so much about trying to help fix society. If you want to be a progressive political activist who volunteers during your free time while avoiding unethical products, that's fine. You do you. But that's not going to win you any brownie points, especially if you are flexing about it all the time. It's also not a valid excuse to be judgmental or aggressive to people who disagree with you or are more on the apathetic side. Just live and let live.",,,,,,,,

good looking men are rapists,"I need to make this post so my mother doesn’t think I’m delusional. I promise there’s nothing with me.

Pee is stored in the balls.,"Pee is stored in the balls because of the intricate network of tubes that connect the urinary tract to the testicles. These tubes, known as the ""Pee Ducts"", are responsible for transporting urine from the bladder to the testicles, where it is stored until it is ready to be expelled.

The testicles themselves play a crucial role in the process of urine storage. As the urine flows into the testicles, it is filtered and purified by the testicular tissue. This process removes impurities and ensures that the urine is of the highest possible quality.

Once the urine has been purified, it is stored in the testicles until the body is ready to expel it. At this point, the urine is expelled from the testicles and flows through the Pee Ducts back to the bladder, where it can be eliminated from the body.

While this may seem like an unusual process, it is actually quite common in the animal kingdom. Many animals, including dogs, cats, and horses, store urine in similar ways. The human body has simply evolved to adapt to this natural process over time.

Shadowbanning comments is such a disgusting behaviour, because it literally hides important information from the commenter, as to why their comment is removed. They really need to stop with that disgusting behaviour that literally tricks users. Like, you know that when you post something, and your message gets removed, the automod at least notify you. But in this case, there is no notification at all. So, mods who implement that disgusting excuse of a shadowban should be demoted, and should never be given any mod powers, ever.

"Right to die should be available across the US, not just to terminal illnesses but uncurable conditions as well","the biggest obstacle has been religion which has dominated the narrative, pushing agendas such as sanctity of life, yet ironically one of the tenants of Christianity is preparation for the next life in regard to heaven or hell.

For those of us who struggle with conditions that significantly impair our ability to enjoy life this ideal can make life seem more like a prison. As someone who has struggled against mental disorders since the beginning this view comes to mind. Theres no cure for certain conditions such as schizophrenia once the damage has set in, and even if you do narrow it out the damage can be too much

doctors object to this in thinking that wanting to die means you are mentally unwell and are not of sound judgement, while this may be true im some cases, most solutions provided may not be enough to solve ones own desire.

If the U.S. would go this route, suicide counts would plummet, because having the option to die in front of you rather than forcing yourself into a painful ""escape"". it may not prevent some, but who commit suicide are looking to take control of something and having it within a reasonable grasp would be enough to deter some.

im not advocating for a culture of ""kill your self if its too much"", rather an acceptance that ones life and their decisions are of their own, that having the option there can be freeing for those struggling with this pain.",,,,,,,,
High to severe forms of ASD and other neurological disorders should be purged via eugenics if possible,"Yeah, title says it all and I'm sorry. I'll explain what prompted me to make this.

[INCIDENT BELOW, SKIP IF YOU DONT CARE]

I was recently on a 6 hour bus ride and I sat next to a man who seemed to have some neurological disorder, probably a severe ASD. Before the bus even takes off, he grows anxious and asks if there is an outlet on the bus for his phone, I say no there is not. He anxiously yells: ""Excuse me, is there an outlet on this bus."" ""I need to know if there is an outlet in this bus"" multiple times until the driver says no.

(Might I add that during the entire ride, he would periodically have strange conversations with himself? He even played an episode of some show on full volume and replayed the same section five times.)

Anyways, about an hour in, he asks me if we are going to stop at a restaurant because he is hungry. I say: ""I can't promise you anything, but on these bus rides, we usually stop at a small gas station for snacks."" He starts again with his yelling: ""DOES ANYONE HAVE SNACK FOR ME, I NEED FOOD OR IM GONNA STARVE! I NEED A RESTAURANT RIGHT NOW! HOW DO NONE OF YOU HAVE FOOD FOR ME!""

I could not believe that I was sitting next to a legal adult. Continuing, another hour later, I have to turn my phone's flashlight on for literally a second. He responds by turning on the bus's interior booth light and grins at me and saying: ""This is what you wanted."" I say: ""Please can you turn off the light?"" ""I thought you wanted it."" he says. 

I turn it off myself, he turns it back on. I leave to the bathroom to get away from him. Twenty minutes later, I returned and when he saw me, he turned the lights back on.

More time passes, he threatens me, saying ""I can't punch a guy with glasses."" I tell him: ""Why would you do that?"" ""It's just a joke"" says he. Then, he started leaning on me, I shove him off aggressively, he puts his arm around me, I yank it off. Continues this a few more times and then I leave to the bathroom for another twenty minutes. When I comeback, he slowly tries to lean on me AGAIN. I tell him: ""get off of me motherfucker, I'm not telling you again."" 

More time later, ""Why can't I lean in you."" ""Listen motherfucker,"" I say ""last chance, do not touch me or I'll have you kicked off this bus.""

[END OF INCIDENT]

I honestly believe that both the haver and the people around him suffer from his disorder.

From his perspective:

1. He is too anxious for which the situation demands. He suffers from extreme anxiety even for small things (like not having an outlet.)

2. Because of his strange and antisocial behavior, he will struggle to make friends.

3. He mentally processes the world and his surroundings in a less sophisticated way.

From my and others perspective:

1. We were made extremely uncomfortable from his tantrums.

2. I was basically threatened.

3. I was basically sexually assaulted multiple times.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLDR/Reasoning:
I do not believe him and people like him can be rehabilitated; I'm sure it is extremely hard to work with people like him and that it's mostly an unchangeable aspect of his personality and genetic.

So why shouldn't we try to eradicate these disorders? Those who have them often suffer from extreme anxiety, have trouble socializing, see the world in a less developed way. Those who interact with them will take on a lot of stress, and possibly be sexually assaulted, harassed, threatened, or assaulted. This has been talked about before on reddit several times. There was a thread about a woman's severely autistic brother who would masturbate to her and be inappropriate to her sexually. They don't understand why it's wrong, they cannot be fixed.

For people here with autism, I am only really talking about severe cases of ASD. I understand that one's autism can be a significant part of their personality, but if we get rid of it in the future, that will no longer be possible.",,,,,,,,
Ariel 2023 Having Racial Diversity Is Good.,"Working with children in a very diverse area. It's nice to see better representation for children of color. Ariel is a good step in the right direction, it's not about us old timers anymore, it's about the children. 

Think about it like this, while it's nice to see white men in there 30s heavily concerned about the race of a mermaids in a children's movie. Growing up, it's always this:

White man saves the day, is the hero, is the main character. 

White female is the princess, the main character, sometimes hero, center of attention, is the main character. 

But we hardly see much positive representation of people of color, only recently changes have been made, but with a lot of push back. 

Black men? Often times portrayed as male thugs, gangsters, needing a white savior, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Black women portrayed loud and obnoxious.

Asian men? Weak, feminine, thugs, or smart but expendable resources, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Asian women are made to hate the Asian men and worship a white man, while hating and denouncing Asian heritage and culture.

These things propagate into our real world through in a sense manipulation and have extremely negative consequences. 

So I'm happy for this movement for better representation. Is it perfect? Nope. But I'm optimistic and think our kids will have a bettee time with more relateable and positive role models through the media.",,,,,,,,
Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts should be promptly removed from in-class duties,"Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding through their shirt should be promptly removed from in-class duties.

Such behaviour is a form of sexual harassment of children who are not free to leave the person doing this, and who are not free to complain about the behaviour without a risk of reprisal from an individual in a position of authority.

Working in a workshop while wearing gag breasts poses a risk of an accident which may injure the teacher or possibly someone else. While some may not care if the teacher injured themself, part of OHS is forbidding workers from working in an unsafe manner.

Persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding is disrespectful to students and other teachers, and is disruptive to a school being a place of learning and personal development. It also promotes disrespect towards women when schools should promote respect for diverse groups of people. (If you’re female and you don’t feel offended, that’s fine, but that doesn’t mean others aren’t offended)

If the teacher claims that the breasts are real, the teacher, possibly during paid work time and paid by the employer, should have a doctor certifying that the breasts are real.

If the teacher is wearing gag breasts because of a mental issue which is not their fault, then they should be removed from in-class duties until their issue has resolved.

If they can’t remove the teacher because of a teacher shortage or restrictions on disciplining teachers, fix the shortage or labour regulations.

Schools should forbid inappropriate clothing for teachers and other staff, not just students.

The school should not wait several months to act, or only act when international media gathered evidence that it was a charade. It should try to avoid punishing students for photographing the teacher - only doing so if it’s to prevent a lawsuit against the school or if the photography is disruptive or endorsing the teacher’s inappropriate behaviour.

It should go without saying, but I’m using “they” because it’s about a hypothetical teacher who may be male or may be female, not because I’m asserting that the teacher is non-binary. And my view is about the school’s handling of the teacher, rather than about the teacher themself.

Self righteousness is one of the most annoying traits someone can have,"I've noticed that so many people have this obnoxious characteristic. For example, people who think their opinions on economic, political, or social issues are morally superior, and judge / attack / cancel anyone who disagrees with them. Or religious people who think their religion makes them superior to non-believers. Or people of certain professions who flex about being more productive members of society than other people. People who are self righteous because they don't consume certain products. You name it.The list goes on and on. These types of people are so off-putting. 

Honestly, as long as you generally treat people with respect and aren't directly hurting anyone, then frankly, I don't give a shit how ""moral"" you are.",,,,,,,,
"As someone who considers himself Progressive, I dislike Democrats way more than Republicans","As someone who has moved further left over the years, I have come to dislike Democrats way more than Republicans. 

The Republican party mantra to me is: ""Yeah, of course we're evil and we're proud of that fact! We wanna take America back to a fictional time when only WASPs had any power!"" and then they stab you 37 times in the chest. At a certain point, what else is there to say about Republicans? At least I know what they stand for.

The Democratic party mantra to me is nothing more than hypocrisy ""Oh yeah, we hear you! We believe that everyone deserves rights and we will fight for the working class!"" Then they stab the working class 37 times in the back and then virtue signal some more.

For example, they'll how much they support George Floyd and other minorities, but then do nothing but wear african garb on the senate floor and support the institutions that led to his death. They'll talk about how they support the working class and unions, then shut down a railroad strike where they wanted sick days.

Democrats co-opt issues I care about and then either do nothing about them, or enable the republicans when they inevitably strike back.

I want my view changed because I would like to feel less annoyed that I have to support such a party to even have a chance at getting legislation I care about passed.

At the end of the day, I acknowledge that Republicans are objectively worse for the nation, but I loathe the fact I'm stuck supporting Democrats.",,,,,,,,
"A significant portion of Southerners in the USA do not want the feral hog problem to be resolved, they want it to stay","The South loves barbecue and one of the staples is pork.

Taxpayer dollars should not be used to bail out Silicon Valley Bank’s depositors.,"If you don’t know, the largest bank for tech companies and venture capitalists, Silicon Valley Bank, just went under. Many of these VCs are calling for the government to step up and pay depositors back their money beyond the insured FDIC $250K.

I don’t think taxpayers should be forced to bankroll rich, Silicon Valley executives, most of which are tech bro white men from rich families and networks who could easily make up the funds lost privately.

I’m a founder of a tech startup. I have raised money from investors. I have learned the ins and outs of my industry and have lots of fellow VC-backed founder friends. 

But I don’t think the general taxpayer should be responsible to pay back private deposits that were lost due to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank’s management and the VCs who caused the bank run that led to its demise. If it were me, I’d figure out a way to operate within the insured amount of funds or put my money in various banks for more security. 

The same VC investors who are so gung-ho about capitalism and have no qualms about screwing the poor and middle classes for their own wealth are now expecting the government, and the general population, to bail them out of something they brought upon themselves.

Yes, some of these startups will have to shut down as a result. But being an entrepreneur is about being able to be scrappy, manage resources effectively, and operate in times of uncertainty. Those that fail due to this SVB situation probably were not using the capital efficiently anyway (maybe that private jet and those fancy dinners weren’t the best use of funds, eh?). 

Startups fail all the time because of forces out of their control. This is no different and it shouldn’t be taxpayers’ problem.

bee byproducts are the most vegan/vegetarian thing to eat that comes from a living being,"Ok so the premise of being a vegetarian/vegan for moralities is that it harms a living thing that can feel pain right? most honey collectors don't harm bees when collecting honey. moreover, some honey also comes from hives that need relocating or are abandoned.

To further my point, bees can relocate whenever/wherever if they do not like being in said area is in some way or form of consenting. They have in fact, left bad beekeepers, but stay with good ones.

So it is to say, that bees and beekeepers have a symbiotic relationship. The bees consent to the harvest of honey (by not relocating). Often then not, beekeepers give them safer homes, prevent death in winter months by providing sugar water if necessary. (beekeepers do more then just that)",,,,,,,,
Religion Should Be a Required Class in High School.,"1) It is the most important thing in life, regardless of your view on it.
2) Having a good understanding of it is so important to understand history and literature (except maybe in East Asia).
3) It is a very difficult subject to self-learn. Much of it comes from texts thousands of years old that need a lot of context to understand. Or stuff like Hinduism that is very scattered and unclear. Parents dont know most of it, and our religious leader's job is more to inspire, build community; not to educate people (not to mention, they aren't neutral).
3.5) Because of that, people are shockingly ignorant about it. I mean, off the top of my head, the stuff Ye said about the 10 lost tribes is absurd.And that ignorance is very useful to charlatans and scammers. I dont think people fall for prosperity gospel/televangelists if they had a better understanding of the Bible. And it would be harder for people to mislead by taking out one or two decontextualized quotes.
4) It is fascinating and inspiring; it is like science fiction almost, the way you learn about ancient cultures that are so different. Religions have a lot of psychological insight and beauty in their traditions. Yeah, there is a lot of ugliness too, but it is a fundamental part of the human experience. I think it is more valuable than literature even.",,,,,,,,
The Federal government should not handle social issues,"I'm not taking any stance on any particular social issue for this argument, but it is my belief is that things would be much better and much less divided if the federal government handled only economic,  and defense issues, among others and not social ones (such as lgbtq+ issues and race based issues). This does not mean they should ignore discrimination against a particular class, but their role should stop at ensuring that the government treats all INDIVIDUALS equally, rather than trying to effect things like trans people in sports and rates of employment for particular classes of people, for example.

I'll make two arguments for why I believe this: 

1) The Federal Gov can only do so much, and has it's hands full already without taking on complex issues of race and identity politics. We would have better outcomes in the non-social areas if the political discussion and elections at the national level avoided focusing on social issues.

and

2) Social Change happens much better and faster if it starts locally and then moves to state level, with any federal legislation being done only after the issue has been worked out at the more local levels

I will use gay marriage vs trans sports inclusion as examples: 

Imagine if in the 90s the congress had passed a law mandating states accept gay marriage. There was much less public support at the time, so this would have cause states to rebel and challenge this with state laws and supreme court challenges, and had it been forced through it likely would have led to a more conservative congress and president being elected in the following cycle, who would then overturn the legislation and possibly pass legislation banning gay marriage that would then be harder to overturn. The way it happened was a much better outcome than this (I am of the opinion that allowing gay marriage is absolutely the right thing to do, as treating gay people differently than straight people is unconstitutional and wrong, but this is just an example for the purpose of this post), and by waiting to pass federal legislation protecting gay marriage until after the public opinion was swayed, we got to a better outcome quicker with less change of it being reversed.

The trans rights issue is a counter example, where the Biden admin mandated that trans athletes be allowed to compete as the gender they identify within high school sports. (I am not taking a position on whether this is the right or wrong policy, it is a complex issue but it is beyond the scope of this post).

We are now seeing backlash against this and other trans issues, and ultimately it seems the pushback is favoring the opposition in popular opinion.

I believe that this approach will lead to a result that is counter to the result that those who believe it is the right thing would want, ie more backlash and more power going to politicians that oppose the rights that those in favor are pushing for.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I think forcing social change at the federal level is counter-productive to the goals of said social change, and it also distracts the public, allowing special interests to essentially sneak by other legislation that very few want that hurts everyone (except the very few who want the legislation).",,,,,,,,

There's something off about transgenderness.,"Hopefully this doesn't break any rules; I need help. I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want to make people who know me hate me over this. I'd like to preface by saying I consider myself to not be right-wing, nor do I think I lean right at all; I'm not conservative. I'm also horrible with words, so I hope I'm able to have the intended meaning of my words come across properly.

I don't think trans people are evil, that they should be punished or that they should have mean words thrown at them; this is not what this is about.

For some reason, I get this visceral reaction when seeing that someone's trans online or irl; I just grimace internally and am like ""It's probably not a good idea to interact too deeply with this person."" While this isn't the case for other LGBT people or most leftists, it is the case with radical feminists or people you'd see at FDS. When I see a comment like ""kill all men"" or ""all cis people stink"", I grimace internally and think to myself it's probably a bad idea to interact too deeply with this individual. ...The same goes for trans people; I've got a few trans acquaintances, and sometimes it's like they're all the same person. I'm not sure if this is some actual pattern recognition or just confirmation bias, but I swear I can sometimes actually predict what their thoughts on random stuff like music will be. I don't think I've met a single transgender person that wasn't autistic or had some other sort of mental disorder either.

This is all based on personal experience and I've got no studies to back my thoughts up other than that one time where I read somewhere that said transgender people are five times more likely to be on the spectrum. ...But there's a clear pattern here. I see conservatives sometimes make similar claims that there's a clear correlation between being transgender and having mental issues... but people just dismiss them as being lunatics, like they're intentionally trying to distort the original person's claim.

I'm not saying they should be forced to detransition or whatever, nor do I think they're actual menaces to society or something, but just like it's \*weird\* to walk on all fours around the mall, it's \*weird\* to buy into all the rhetoric, partake into cancel culture, have pronouns in bio, all that stuff. Like, I get it: gender roles suck. I actually wish I were born a woman myself 'cause it'd affect how people treat me and shit. But I wasn't; I'm not, and I frankly think it's a bit, well, grimace-inducing to think you've become a woman or a man or some new sort of individual just because you decided to start/stop wearing makeup or dress like a 70-year-old grandpa. I once read a story about a happily married straight couple that was perfectly average until one of them realized she was a lesbian and the other one that she was a woman. And then they're happily married lesbians. ...And to me that makes no sense! Sexuality isn't a switch you can flip! People don't become hot just because they claim to be something different than you thought they were, now do they??

Help me out please. I didn't think too much when writing this and there's probably a lot I've expressed badly or left unsaid or something (don't take me trying to explain it better in comments as me changing my view). Feel free to ask clarifying questions I guess? I don't want to be this judgmental transphobic individual, but I can't help but see the patterns! I feel like thinking that there's nothing wrong and that they're all fine, dandy and mentally healthy is just me lying to myself.",,,,,,,,
most pollution enthusiasts can't logically reason why the transition to EVs is bad,"There are the typical arguments like the long tailpipe theory, which there is validity to, but can easily be defeated. Coal power stations concentrate pollution in certain areas instead of spreading it around like ICE cars. Then there's mining, which yes, is valid as well, but 95% of lithium batteries are recyclable multiple times. Even before being crushed, can be used in second life applications like large scale energy storage. A pound of lithium goes further than a barrel of oil. Some even go as far as saying they love the sound of ICE vehicles, which is very silly to me. If someone loves the smell of rotting garbage, is that a logical excuse to not clean it up?

It's with these facts and questions in mind that I posit that a lot of pollution enthusiasts who are against electrification have no solid ground to stand on.

There is nothing wrong with video games having an easy mode or people wanting one.,"I’ve always been perplexed when people get upset at the addition of (or someone saying they’d want an addition of) an easy mode to games that they enjoy.

I’m someone who enjoys modes and will use a variety of modes depending on the mood I’m in/ how much time I have. If it’s a genre I’m familiar with and I feel like I challenge I would choose “hard.” If I’m not as into the gameplay for a game and just want to enjoy the story I’d have no problem choosing “easy.” For times where I’m feeling somewhere in-between I’ll choose normal.

I really enjoy the flexibility different difficulty modes in video games but see pushback against difficulty modes a lot so I wanted to see others perspectives.

I understand that some people always want a challenge, but I’m not sure how it affects their gameplay to simply choose “hard” and let others do as they wish. 

Different modes and more decisions with how gameplay works also helps people with disabilities that might make video games more challenging. 

All and all I’d like to understand the criticism and know if there’s something I’m overlooking.",,,,,,,,
shaving cause rapid/thicker hair growth,"Hello im bad grammar kid 
Anyways 
I seriously think shaving makes hair grow faster in certain area's (not the head)  a lot of people say as soon as they started shaving it grows faster or thicker even with me the side i shaved looks different from the side i didn't shave. I asked quite a few people some answers i got from the women
"" i didn't shave for years, it was small it wasn't as noticeable but once they started shaving it got noticeable at a very face pace""  I know people like to say oh maybe it's the age or maybe it's just the way it looks !!!  Or how how about you shave your head to see if it grows faster or your facial hair. Lets talk about the facial part when i started shaving it rapidly started growing faster and thicker then it stop at some point though. It just a big coincidence that as soon as started shaving it made major changes but right before that no major changes at all. 
Its just way too many coincidence about shaving that everyone feels this way and that is just a myth and people personal experiences. Someone told me a story that they had Google this before and they made a big mistake by listening to Google shaved anyway and had to seek laser treatment for this. She said for years she wasn't hairy but within just 1 year after shaving a mustache it grew way thicker in noticeable.
I ask her ""well why did you feel the need to shave in the first place?"" She said it was just a few little hairs that wasn't really noticeable to the public but thought no big deal if she shaved.",,,,,,,,
"North Korea is actually a far right ethno-fascist state under the guise of Stalinist-Communism, not an actual Communist state."," 

Just what  is North Korea, exactly? Outsiders have been trying to figure out for many decades just what their deal is. How does the Kim regime and military elites want their own people to view about themselves and the world, and how do they want the outside world to view them? Their actions don't seem to match their records, and their records don't seem to match their actions, either. It's quite bizarre, even to South Koreans.

Before I take on these questions based on my aforementioned view in the post's title, I would like to give some background information as to how I got to making this post in the first place and why I think this sort of discussion is desperately needed. I am myself quite the history buff and geek ever since my high school years, even though I am not and never was a History major in university. I just have an innate desire to make sense of the world. There's a saying that learning an unbiased and objective history of humankind in all sorts of distant kingdoms, empires, and hegemonic states/republics can help you understand and help you prescribe solutions for the the world in present times. Well, as someone of East Asian descent I just wanted to make sense of the crazy tensions between the 3 great powers of the Asian sphere: the Korean peninsula, China, and Japan. I especially wanted to know why Korea is the way it is now, and how it got to be, tragically, divided in half(much like a caged tiger), for many decades; and just why no one, even South Koreans themselves, seems to really understand the Kim regime and its people. It's kinda like how when you see your neighbor next door trying to arm themselves to the teeth and installing all these military grade security systems in their house in a completely safe neighborhood. The first thing that comes to mind would not be how I should stop this guy from being a nut. It would instead be on ""how this guy thinks."" The same applies for such an isolated country like North Korea. Knowing this can help the world leaders in South Korea and the United States on how to best reunify the country with the least amount of misery and death.

Anyways, back to the main point of this post. Now, I share the perspective that Korea is actually a hereditary, far right national socialist state with Korean characteristics/traditions. However, I just want to provide an overview of the few school of thoughts out there, with regard to what North Korea actually is, and there are 5 to be exact:

1.) The traditional conservative view is that North Korea is just merely a Stalinist-Communist holdover from the Soviet era. I understand why a lot of casual viewers of mass media may fall into this perspective, because the whole North Korean propaganda schtick with the red and sickle symbolisms, and left-wing style rhetoric like ""Democratic People's Republic"" and ""the masses"" really does make it seem North Korea is like a Stalinist-Communist regime. Actually, many South Koreans who are just casual watchers of their own mass media(KBS, Yonhap News, SBS, etc.) tend to hold this view.

2.) The neoliberal/neoconservative view is that North Korea is a state that has just degraded into a rogue state trying to one day, in their minds, proliferate their nuclear arsenal to the point where they can gain the upper hand over the United States, in order to gain the sovereignty that they desire. The communist style propaganda, the massive military parades, and the like are just a means to an end, in order to shore up support from North Korean citizens over its Songun ""Military first"" policies needed to build more nukes.

3.)The leftist and liberal view is that North Korea is simply just a continuation of Confucian dynastic traditions from way before Japanese occupation, and that it is neither Communist nor Fascist. Their rationale is that all they ever wanted was to be left alone, and that had the United States not carpet-bombed the hell out of the northern part of the peninsula, then the Kim regime might have took a milder form of dictatorship, akin to post-70s North Vietnam's or East Germany's. This may seem like the most logical explanation, but there is a major flaw to this line of thinking, which I will get to after this overview.

4.)The permanent bunker Fascist state view(My View): Not long ago, I have stumbled upon and read B.R Myers' ""The Cleanest Race"" on North Korea actually being an Imperial Japanese fascist holdover from the 30s and 40s. Now, B.R Myers seems to have no leanings in the academic world of Korean history and literature. He just simply told it like it was, in terms of the order of events starting from the Japanese annexation of Korea. His rationale was this: The Japanese Imperial government stationed in Korea at the time deliberately brewed up race-based Korean nationalism, in order to establish a kinship between Koreans and the Japanese. Ironically enough, a lot of the intellectuals that helped out with Kim Il Sung's propaganda machine were actually pro-Japanese collaborators who decided to then turn this pro-Japanese Korean nationalism into a purely Korean version. Much of the iconography meant to glorify the Kim family was actually based on Japan's own propaganda of venerating Emperor Hirohito. Yes, I am not making this shit up. After reading this really groundbreaking and impartial analysis of North Korea, I've had severe cognitive dissonance(for a few days) as someone who is actually of Korean descent. The hard hitting and cold truth is that many literate middle and upper class Koreans at the time all felt this collective shame for supporting Imperial Japan upon their defeat in WW2, so they all felt like they wanted to settle the score, save face, and feel better about themselves as proud Koreans. Out of the 5 perspectives, I would say this holds the most weight and validity, due to B.R Myers' intensive research on what ""actually happened"" all those decades ago from Korea's liberation to the start of the Korean War. As a Korean, I am very much aware that Korean history researched by Korean academics themselves tend to muddy the waters and to steep itself in nationalism. His approach was a way of cutting through all the noise, and focus purely on the truth of the chronology of events that had occurred in the peninsula. It was certainly quite the plot twist in terms of truly changing what we already had believed to be true about North Korea. It's quite fitting, because Korean thrillers and mysteries are also filled with plot twists and irony.

5.) Finally, the bleakest of all perspectives is that North Korea is just a straight up hypocritical racketeering mafia state bent on its own survival. This perspective is mainly held by independent journalists of various political stripes that mainly try to expose corruption in a lot of 3rd world countries(kleptocracies, oligarchies, and the like). All the propaganda the state is trying to spew to the public and to the outside world are merely political manipulations designed to cover up for the corruption of its military elites. Much like the 2nd perspective in that it is a rogue state trying to survive, only this time it manipulates geopolitics in a way that serves their own monetary interests in underground industries. If this is to be true, then this is truly a bleak scenario in which the Kim regime and its military elites are guaranteed its longevity unless it is overtaken violently by inside or outside forces.

...

Now, with all that out of the way, I just want to offer my counter arguments to all of them and to offer further supporting arguments to the 4th view(my view):

1.) Contrary to popular belief, Kim Il Sung was not socialist in the Marxist-Leninist sense. In fact, he wasn't really educated or literate about Marxist-Leninist intellectualism himself. He dropped out of school entirely when he was 16 or 17, in order to involve himself in resistance movements against the Japanese. It wasn't until he was picked by the Soviets to lead the Northern half, after making a name for himself as a guerilla fighter against Japan. He had only implemented the red iconography and leftist style propaganda, in order to provide cover for himself so that his administration can start nation building without the Soviets butting in. The real purpose of his propaganda was purely for fascist, race-based reasons, which I will get into later when I get to B.R Myers' perspective.

2.) It's not necessarily true that North Korea seeks power or hegemony over United States, or that it has the intention of using the nuclear weapons. The Kim regime, unpredictable and irrational as they seem, will not actually use a nuke themselves; because it knows it would spell the end for their regime if they do.

3.) Yes, it is true that Kim Jong Un is a rational actor. He does, indeed, care about the survival of his regime. It's also true that North Koreans do want their sovereignty and they do want to be left alone. However, it is not a Confucian state or a continuation of previous Korean kingdoms, by any means. The fascist style propaganda and iconography of the Kim family intended to portray motherly figures, not fatherly figures, which is the basis for an Confucian based authoritarian state. They are shown to be these really feminine caretaker figures. If paintings showing men around the same age laying their heads on Kim's bosom for comfort and warmth, then I don't know what is a more motherly undertone than that. If that wasn't prove enough, just look at how dozens and dozens of young kids in uniforms rush to feel his embrace every time he goes up to a podium to commence a massive speech.

4.) Now, onto my view. To reiterate from my overview of this perspective, pro-Japanese collaborators were hired by none other than Kim Il Sung himself to create his propaganda machine for him. Koreans, during the Japanese annexation, were actually incentivized to be proud of their own Korean race, in order for the Imperial government to establish a kinship between Koreans and Japanese. A lot of the literate middle and upper class Koreans felt this collective shame for supporting Japan upon their defeat in WW2, so they would often entrench themselves in these intellectual enclaves to create their own unique forms of pure Korean ethno-nationalism, thereby kicking the Japanese out of it. Much of modern day North Korean propaganda comprises of dehumanizing Western adversaries, mainly United States, as these big nosed tainted people conspiring to taint their brethren in the South and to ultimately their own homeland and racial stock. This strongly resembles a lot of the iconography depicted in Nazi German propaganda whereas they depicted Jews as scheming individuals out to taint the German race, traditions. and sovereignty. The difference between North Korean fascism and German fascism is that Korean fascism is more of an inward kind, whereas German fascism was expansionist(e.g.. Lebensraum). The Kim family's version of ethno-fascism is one where because the Korean race is too pure, it had been bullied for its kindness and innocence. Therefore, Koreans need a motherly figure to look out for them. By the way, if anyone is arguing that the Kims are considered as fatherly leaders/generals, they are not. In fact, it's actually a mistranslation of a lot of Western documentaries. The word "" 어머 "" means mother or relating to motherly characteristics.

5.) Now, I don't entirely discredit the mafia state theory; but I do think money is needed anyway to fund their nuclear operations and to just simply feed themselves. By ""they"", I mean a lot of the military elites. I think that their dealings with underground industries are just a means to an end, in order to legitimize their fascist state. The reason why I say ""out of necessity"" is that they lost much of the aid and revenue after the fall of the Soviet empire in the early 90s. They simply are just broke as hell, and need to find ways to fund their state, even if it resorts to dealing with the criminal world. By and large, I don't think that these dealings are truly corrupting military elites(maybe some). If this racketeering corruption theory were really true, then why didn't the Kim regime just collapse during the Great famines in the 90s? Surely, the military elites and common class soldiers would have to put a bullet on them in rebellion out of desperation for better material well being. Plus, a kleptocratic mafia state implies a materialist mindset, which fascism uses does not subscribe to. The difference between fascism and communism is really this. Communism offers improvements in material well being for the ""masses."" Fascism just straight up offers struggle and strive in both good and bad times, in order to strength the sovereignty and purity of their state and race, respectively.

I am curious as to what my fellow Redittors think is the most accurate perspective on North Korea, and why the ""bunker Fascist state"" theory would be wrong.",,,,,,,,
No objective prescriptive statement or objective moral framework is supported by reality.,"Status: no change
I believe no objective moral framework exists, and only subjective meaning exists.

Following the previous conclusion, I also believe objective prescriptive statements do not exist. By this, I mean any statement like: “if you want to have blue hair, you SHOULD dye your hair blue.” Although this statement is logical, I believe the objective “should” is never justified. This chain of logic obviously feels very unintuitive to me, but considering that I believe there is no objective meaning or actions that should be taken It seems only logical that prescriptive statements are always subjective.

To this end, I will make several claims for two cases.

If a god does not exist:
1. An objective moral framework does not exist
2. All meaning is subjective 
3. All prescriptive staments are subjective 

If an all-knowing god exists:
1. No noncircular explanation for an objective moral framework exists
2. No non-circular explanation for the existence of meaning exists
3.No non-circular explanation for the existence of objective prescriptive statements exists.

An example of a circular argument would be: an all-knowing god exists, it knows killing people is wrong, and therefore it is objectively immoral to kill people. You must prove how the conclusion can be reached by a method other than knowing it is true. 

*Additional standards I will hold myself to on CMV.*

If a comment causes me to change anything about any claim I made, that will award a delta, but if I simply need to modify the logic used to reach my conclusions, my mind hasn’t been changed.

To that end, I will try to reply to as many comments as I can. Additionally, all my responses will be the first of these categories that occur and state the category.
1. A clarification 
2. That I have already addressed a similar argument 
3. It changed my mind
4. That their argument seems convincing, but more information is needed to change my mind
5. Addressing why I believe there to be a specific logical or factual inaccuracy in the comment
6. That I don’t believe the initial assumptions needed to make their claim
7. Why their claim is contested information (information that experts reasonably disagree on or are unsure about the conclusion) 

*reasons for wanting view changed*
Universally: although it isn’t my only aim in life, one of the things I want to peruse is finding truth and holding informed opinions. While I do consider my viewpoints I am far from infallible and even some of my most well reaserched or thought out opinions might be false. Whenever I learn new information that changes my mind this marks an improvement in the truth of my opinions and beliefs.
Post specific: not believing in prescriptive statements feels like cognitive dissonance or something. It’s kinda exhausting whenever I think about it.",,,,,,,,
STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice.,"STAR voting is a voting system where you give as many candidates as you want a 0-5 rating.  Then,  there's a stimulated runoff between the two candidates with the highest average ratings.  The candidate who is higher ranked on more ballots is the winner.

For example, if you give Alice a rating of 5 and Bob a rating of 4, you count as a vote for Alice in a runoff between Alice and Bob.   If you gave them both a 5, you'd count as an obstention.

This is a useful deterrent to certain kinds of strategic voting.  For example, suppose you're voting in a presidential election, and you're trying to maximize the chance of Bernie Sanders winning.  Naively, the way to do that is to give Bernie Sanders a 5 and everyone else a 0.  However,  the problem with that is if the runoff is actually between Elizabeth Warren and Trump, you've abstained even though you presumably prefer Warren to Trump.  Likewise if the runoff is between Warren and Biden,  Biden and Kasich or Kasich and Trump.  If you want your vote to count in the runoff, voting honestly is a far superior strategy than bullet voting. 

Instant runoff voting is a voting system where voters list their first, second, third, etc choices.  Then, if there's not a candidate with an absolute majority of the remaining votes, you eliminate the candidate with the lowest vote total and reallocate the votes to their next *remaining* preference.

In IRV, your second place selection gets no support from you until your first place is eliminated, assuming your second place wasn't eliminated first.  This means that compromise candidates with a lot of second place support could easily be eliminated early, and that election order is very important.

Instant runoff has some really weird edge cases because elimination order is very important to the results.  For example, in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, the Progressive candidate won.   However, Republicans could have caused the Progressive candidate to lose by having the right number of Republicans put the Progressive as their top choice, or by staying home.

IRV makes it so 

[Ka Ping Yee has an interesting voting system visualizion, coloring in a 2d political compass by the color of the candidate who would win if the center of public opinion is within that area.](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/)  Most systems produce sensible diagrams, but IRV produces the oddest looking diagrams, with shapes that make no sense.  STAR isn't on there, but it shouldn't look too much different from approval. 

[An important way to look at voting systems is 'Voter Satisfaction Efficiency'](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic), a measure of how happy people are with the results.  IRV is slightly better than plurality, but significantly worse than approval voting, STAR or 3-2-1.",,,,,,,,
Religion was created by humans to make sense of the unknown and unexplainable,"I admit I haven't delved deeply into the Bible, but I question the reasoning behind the spread of Christianity. Why didn't God send divine messengers like Jesus to other societies and cultures, especially given the diverse religious beliefs and practices across different cultures? The coexistence of different religions has led me to wonder whether Christianity is a human invention.

Why did God choose to establish a foothold in Israel instead of China or Japan? 

As far as I understand, religion was one of the earliest means by which societies came together as communities to achieve common goals. It served as a way to facilitate community growth and development.

I wonder if there were highly intelligent individuals who recognized the potential of religion as a tool for community development and capitalized on it to bring people together in the past.",,,,,,,,
Most feminist groups only care about men's problems if they affect women,"Tl;dr: Mainstream groups that aim for gender equality are useless at addressing issues that mostly affect men because they only really care about women.

Usually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women (e.g. college enrollment rates, suicide, homelessness, loneliness) and say that efforts should be made to address them, the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups. I'd argue that feminist groups shouldn't be left to solve them.

It seems to me that **most** feminist groups only care about men's issues if they affect women. Recently I saw [this article linked](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/) and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely. The article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated. That these men are miserable is an afterthought.

Similarly, boys who start to be exposed to Andrew Tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women. Incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that they're lonely and miserable is ignored. Usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students, it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that they're more likely to struggle with student debt.

It seems that if men would only be miserable, lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women, these groups would be perfectly happy so I don't trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected.",,,,,,,,
People who cause physical harm to nazis for their political beliefs are no better than nazis,"I’m talking purely about their political beliefs, if they decide to go further and I act violence towards other then it’s a different conversations.

Currently there is not a meaningful amount of power towards white supremacists, nazis, white identitarians or white nationalists. Currently all they can do is speak. Freedom of speech and diversity of thought is one of the most important aspects of a functioning democracy. When people begin to physically assault others for their beliefs it is a sign of a movement towards authoritarianism.

This is because violence towards people who have any differing opinions is only dependent on the common idea and can be turned in any direction if enough people agree. 

Ex. If I think that transgenderism is wrong and immoral and as dangerous as fascism and I have people that support me and we assault people who support transgenderism how are we any different than people who assault nazis?

We’re not as it’s just about beliefs and if we decide to say it’s okay to assault people of x belief it opens up the door to assaulting people of any belief just because you disagree with them.",,,,,,,,
people who are involuntarily celibate deserve much more empathy.,"  hi and before you even ask ,YES, i am a gay male who is still a virgin at 25. so what really grinds my gears is that as one of these people i feel i have nowhere to turn because being involuntary celibate or an incel have become words laced with so much negative association and is seen as such a taboo thing to be , and its ridiculous. the first thing out of peoples mouths when they hear incel is those people need help, well if every time i go to ask for help and tell someone for help they're automatically disgusted and want nothing to do with it , how am i supposed to get help.

   next, is my problem with the first argument they throw up , is that we are whiny and no ones entitled to sex and you have to earn that. bullshit, my whole life ive watched gay men and straight women literally throw themselves at men who are complete trash, not because they were respectable or they earned it but becuase they were cute or had a certain status so dont give me that, those guys didnt do anything special to get laid, people are just shallow. why cant people just admit it.

  i literally had to stop watching gay porn because my distain and contempt for good looking or conventionally attractive gay men in porn was getting so strong. i mean sitting there watching someone not only have sex anytime they want but get paid for it made me furious. which bring me to my next point, you say were too focused on sexual relationships when ITS EVERYWHERE. tv, media, everything is oozing with sex all the time, so cant you understand how it would make a person feel extremely inadequate not being apart of that and never having experienced sex.

"As a trans woman, I believe that the mainstream feminist movement doesn't have our core interests at heart, and I no longer call myself a feminist as a result.","For context, I've been transitioned and living as a trans woman for almost 7 years, basically my entire adult life minus around 6 months or so. So I'm not new to womanhood as I've experienced it.

I was raised in a liberal household with a strong mom who rose to a very high level in her company and I respect her for it. I've always been pro life, pro women's rights, and have a desire to dismantle/reform the systems that oppress all women and other minorities alike.

But at the same time, to me it's become painfully obvious that mainstream feminism has a lot of limitations when it comes to representing all its members, especially trans women like me.

In my view, to this day, mainstream feminism was created by and for cis women, and is mainly made up of cis women. This isn't bad in of itself, as mass movements can often achieve a lot of pressure for change just by existing, but sometimes can lead to awkward situations from the overwhelming cisgender nature of things.

The pussy hats at the 2016 women's March were a prime example, as I felt like the body part reductionist message there left me feeling what place at all I had there. Why bother showing up when my mental health would become a net negative due to the glaring reminders of what I don't have (that also marked womanhood and solidarity in that specific time and place)?

That kind of stuff combined with feminist cis women who are either apathetic towards or actively opposed to trans people like me has made me care a lot more about my own trans community than their feminist one. Should I bother to change how I see this, or continue to stick with advocacy within my own community?",,,,,,,,
Financial incentives will not solve decreasing birth rates,"A common reason I hear for decreasing birth rates is that people can no longer afford it due to increased cost of living. I disagree, I believe the main reason birth rates are decreasing is because people are simply not interested in having children.

Many countries have tried providing financial incentives to increase birth rates, (China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc). All of their birth rates are projected to continue decreasing. Even countries with the most generous child care subsidies, like the Denmark and Luxembourg, have below replacement fertility rates. 

If even the Nordic countries, which subsidize child care, high quality public education, college expenses, and healthcare (reducing the financial burden of raising a child) cannot bring their fertility rates above replacement level, it suggests that financial incentives are not enough to meaningfully increase birth rates.

I believe the biggest reason for the decrease in birth rates is because more and more people don't see children as necessary to having a meaningful life. It's no coincidence birth rates decrease as a country develops; more people (especially women) are able to be educated and find careers/afford pastimes that provide them a sense of fulfillment. This would explain why people with higher incomes/education have less children: there are more options to life.

Societal values have shifted. Back when women were discouraged from pursuing higher education and professional careers, a lot of them followed societal expectations of ""women are supposed to be mothers."" Now that the societal pressure has decreased, it's only natural that less women choose to follow the traditional lifestyle that was once pushed onto them. We see women are having children at later age, and having less children overall.

Children are a lot of work. Even if you paid me to be a parent, I wouldn't be interested, because it is a huge time commitment, it can be emotionally taxing, and can sometimes require sacrifices in our personal goals.

There was an interesting observation made on Chinese social media. The post stated that for a long time, men never understood how difficult parenting can be, since they dumped all the heavy lifting of childrearing onto their wives. Now that women have more opportunities in life, the father has a greater role in childrearing, and many Chinese fathers are realizing it was much harder than they initially thought.

After you finish your 9-5 job for the day, the second shift begins. Tantrums in the early years, worrying about your child's academic performance, making sure your child has good values and stays out of trouble, requires a lot of quality time. Considering all the implications parenting has on your career, the decrease in free time for yourself, the emotional toll of seeing your child go through hard times, I'm not surprised more people are choosing to embrace other lifestyles like DINK, being a Disney adult, or raising a pet.",,,,,,,,
emotional affairs doesn’t exist when it’s someone you have no physical attraction to,"I believe that emotional affairs are often a precursor to physical affairs. However, if the person in question is someone you have absolutely no physical attraction to, it’s just a close friend.

I’ve seen some people say emotional affairs are when you are sharing something with someone else that you wouldn’t share with your spouse because “they wouldn’t understand you”. I would agree if they are attracted to them (I.e. a straight male sharing with a straight female), but if it’s a straight man sharing it with another straight man then isn’t that fine?

I’ve also seen people say it’s when you share something with someone that you wouldn’t share with your spouse. Something intimate. This I can understand if it’s a long relationship, but if it’s early on and something happens, surely you would be more inclined to share things with your close friends rather than a new partner?

Gender Identity from Oxford dictionary:
""a person's innate sense of their gender""

People need to calm down about the pride flag mural in Fort Lauderdale being ran over,"As reported by NBC Miami:

&gt; Fort Lauderdale Police are investigating after a pride flag street mural was defaced with tire marks.
The incident happened back on Feb. 28 on Sebastian Street, where the 150-foot long flag is painted on the ground.
According to a police report, a surveillance camera captured the driver of a Ford F-250 pickup truck doing a burnout along the length of the mural before leaving the scene.

Whether it was intentional or not, isn't it obvious that anything painted on the road is going to get scuffed? I've even heard people saying that this is some sort of hate crime! How on God's green earth is this a hate crime? As far as I can tell, people need to calm down and understand that something like this is bound to happen, at least once, if something is painted in the middle of the road.

Also, I love how the mainstream media literally loses its mind when a pride flag is driven over, but the BLM riots were apparently ""speaking the language of the unheard."" People need a little more common sense and understanding.",,,,,,,,
Conservative Trans people exist," One of the real tragedies of contemporary politics is that our most bitter disagreements are about something that doesn’t even exist—the political spectrum. Left and right are entirely tribal designations and have no unifying philosophy or principle behind them that can be represented on a unidimensional spectrum.

This may sound like an absurd claim, but before rejecting out of hand, consider that the political spectrum rests on an essentialist theory of ideology that has been soundly falsified. The essentialist theory says that, although it may seem that there are many distinct political issues in politics, there is actually just one big issue—an underlying essence that ties them all together (e.g., change vs. preservation, equality vs. freedom, order vs. liberty, realism vs. idealism, etc.). If politics is unidimensional (about one essential issue), then a unidimensional political spectrum is adequate to represent politics.

 The common retort of many essentialists is that conservatives or liberals who switch their positions so easily aren’t “true conservatives” or “true liberals” But in this, the essentialists are falling prey to the “private language fallacy”—the erroneous belief that a *private* individual can arbitrarily determine the meaning of *public* words. The thousands of Fox News-watching, Bush-voting, Limbaugh-listening, CPAC-supporting people in these studies call themselves “conservatives,” the media calls them “conservatives,” and the politicians they support are coded as “conservative” in ideological voting measures; they are, therefore, “real conservatives” in the only sense that it’s possible to be a “real conservative.” Because there is no transcendent definition of ideology beyond the tribe, those who compose the liberal and conservative tribes are, by definition, “true” liberals and conservatives. Those who insist otherwise might be falling prey to motivated reasoning–seeking to justify their own ideology by appealing to principle.

I understand why so many of us want to believe in the political spectrum—it makes politics simple and gives us the illusion that our party’s beliefs have an underlying (and righteous) philosophical coherence—but it’s time to face up to the facts. “Right-wing” and “left-wing” are little more than tribal designations. Shedding our jerseys might help us become more rational, more humble, less tribal, and ultimately, more open-minded when it comes to public issues.",,,,,,,,
I think the United States of America 🇺🇸should step back from the trying to preserving democracy in other countries and do some self healing. Here’s my simplistic and flawed take.

I don’t think having a utopian world with united countries is impossible

Each nation has their choice in the EU . , and with that should come accountability from everyone in a government position . Journalism should be cherished, “real” news whatever it may be should be looked upon in

As for Americans

in the most simplest way of explaining it. We have a list of problems we need to starts checking off immediately. Look to California for example. Millions of dollars and you find that “humans” gum that system up. THROWING MONEY AT  PROBLEMS does not work It even sounds dumb typing it, is that not technically what California is doing with at the very  least a few of their travesties. We would probably have to make a statement on seeking HEAVY prosecution of those who take governmental positions only to favor in corruption, if convicted that is.

IMO:Most important thing is fixing the voting system. With surplus amount of people in the country it’s a fact that most people aren’t fucking psycho that you meet on a day to day basis so there’s the point in making the voting system more efficient.

it’s sooo  obvious This country has potential to self correct. And if you don’t think so then what are we doing here ? There’s problems it can be fixed. More people just have to have an influence.

Majority should lead the authority  on any matter. Wouldn’t you agree ?

Oh and something should be done about “conflict of interest” situations In any government involvement like legal battles with citizens. It’s a naughty tactic that I believe has been used IMO  just Incase I didn’t miss any.

This is just my opinion though but In reality nothing will be done 🤷‍♂️

Last thought. We’re all gonna die and whether or not when the lights go out you go up into the big sky or something. The fact of the matter is that there is only one Earth. This may be your only experience you have with Earth. It needs to be preserved. The fact that we even debate whether or not to use nukes is Sooooo dumb.

"Especially with social media, there needs to be some kind of censorship","The debate of censorship has been beat down ad nauseam and I'll admit, I used to be on the side of absolutely no censorship and allow the marketplace of ideas to run it's course. However, this slowly changed as my world views shifted slightly.

I think the best analogy I can use is 4chan compared to Reddit. A lot of Reddit mods are weird assholes who are power hungry (keep in mind, these weirdos are doing this shit for free, which is even more weird when you think about it). However, there are still a lot of mods who are just trying to be fair and do their job (usually the cooler mods are in smaller subs).

Now in contrast, 4chan is actually a fucking cesspool. You have the most objectively racists POS conversing on their with their shield of anonymity. I don't care how young they might be or what their background is, it's genuinely unsettling to know there are people out there who can even contemplate some of the things they are saying.

I think there has to be some kind of moderation, especially with social media. You just cannot allow humans to propagate ANY ideas because of free speech. The real issue in my opinion is whether or not the mods have abused their power and overstepped their powers. I can totally understand how some people think having no censorship is the ideal solution. I just think it's not going to be achievable because there is always some degenerate asshole out there who will say or do things most of us couldn't even conceive of.",,,,,,,,

Each nation has their choice in the EU . , and with that should come accountability from everyone in a government position . Journalism should be cherished, “real” news whatever it may be should be looked upon in

As for Americans

in the most simplest way of explaining it. We have a list of problems we need to starts checking off immediately. Look to California for example. Millions of dollars and you find that “humans” gum that system up. THROWING MONEY AT  PROBLEMS does not work It even sounds dumb typing it, is that not technically what California is doing with at the very  least a few of their travesties. We would probably have to make a statement on seeking HEAVY prosecution of those who take governmental positions only to favor in corruption, if convicted that is.

Most important thing is fixing the voting system. With surplus amount of people in the country it’s a fact that most people aren’t fucking psycho that you meet on a day to day basis so there’s the point in making the voting system more efficient.

it’s sooo  obvious This country has potential to self correct. And if you don’t think so then what are we doing here ? There’s problems it can be fixed. More people just have to have an influence.

Majority should lead the authority  on any matter. Wouldn’t you agree ?

Oh and something should be done about “conflict of interest” situations In any government involvement like legal battles with citizens. It’s a naughty tactic that I believe has been used IMO  just Incase I didn’t miss any.

This is just my opinion though but In reality nothing will be done 🤷‍♂️

Last thought. We’re all gonna die and whether or not when the lights go out you go up into the big sky or something. The fact of the matter is that there is only one Earth. This may be your only experience you have with Earth. It needs to be preserved. The fact that we even debate whether or not to use nukes is Sooooo dumb.

Humans are moral.,"I know I've posted this before, but some people tended to stop responding quickly or just not providing reasoning. The mods can remove it if they want. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here it is:

Just because we do something good and it makes us feel good doesn't mean it was selfish. 

a. That isn't necessarily WHY we did it

b. It's not PLEASURE when we feel good in this case, it's aesthetic from the moral situation. Therefore, the DIRECT reason, at least, is that that is the moral state of the situation. Why you want that moral state? Fair, it could be selfish, but still, my point stands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a common argument:

Evolution: First of all, evolution can't think. It can't be selfish. Second of all, it is an ECOLOGICAL process that determines WHICH ORGANISMS DOMINATE, not why the individual organisms are like that. 

  
Anyway, feel free to defend this point and/or offer other one(s). But PROVIDE REASONING(and definitions since sometimes they conflict), and don't accuse me of being unwilling to change my view. And don't just explain the idea or offer an explanation. If that happens, I'll block you until you stop, because that's NOT WHAT THIS POST IS FOR.

I think it’s okay to have race swapped characters. It’s not always about being woke.,"Let me start off by saying… that I am probably against “woke” ideology 9/10.

I’ve seen titles like Peter Pan, Velma &amp; The Little Mermaid get crap for having characters ethnicities change from the original. 

In those cases, I DO think they are doing it to be woke. Their track record and/or (in the case of Velma) flat out state it. 

However I don’t think that always has to be the case. 

If the persons ethnicity has absolutely no bearing on the story, I don’t see why it matters what actor or actress plays them.

I think there is is nuance involved and many other things. Story, writing and the track record of the studio. 

Like if Amazon/MGM make Idris Alba the next 007. I wouldn’t see that as being woke. You simply have a British actor with a name that would probably bring people to the theater. I don’t think it would be woke in that case. 


So, could someone possibly explain why there is no way around wokeness in race swapping?",,,,,,,,
Western society needs to be more appreciated and protected. It’s unfairly hated on.,"When I say “western society” I’m speaking about countries like the USA, UK, Canada etc. I’ve been seeing a rise in hatred towards western society lately. People saying it’s become too “woke”, that we have lost our values, that western society is dying a slow death. Don’t get me wrong, no society is or will ever be perfect. Western society has its flaws, however if we look at it from a historical perspective I would argue that western society has provided its citizens with some of the most stable, RELATIVELY safe, overall good quality of life in human history. 

The freedom of choosing whatever religion you want to be, having the opportunity to become successful and make a business, average life span of 80 years old, good healthcare, good education, ability to travel, these are all things westerners have come to EXPECT, however rarely in history did people ever have such luxuries. After World War II western countries had seen stability and growth for decades and decades. 

There’s a reason western countries lead and have lead for a long time in human development indexes, happiness indexes, freedom of press indexes, freedom &amp; safety indexes. 

If people really want to see the fall of the west, I’d say be careful with what you replace it with.",,,,,,,,
People who post videos/photos of themselves doing good deeds are not good people.,"You know what I’m talking about. Those TikToks of people who record themselves engaging in pre-planned acts of altruism and charity, like recording yourself making a bunch of food to give to the homeless and handing it out. When I see those, I don’t think “Wow, they’re such a good person.” I think “Wow, they’re a narcissistic piece of shit whose only motivation to do good deeds is an audience.” 

If you’re recording your good deeds for internet clout, that’s not charity, it’s a neutral exchange. 

Good deeds should just be done for the sake of doing them. That’s what a truly good person does. Pointing at yourself and screaming “Look how good of a person I am!” is what a narcissistic piece of shit does.",,,,,,,,
"In my opinion, it doesn't make sense for there to be any religious entities.","I have utmost respect to people who follow any religion.

For example, God couldn't exist because if it is stated to have been able to create things out of nothing, that defies commonly accepted laws of conservation of mass.

When I said, ""fear of the unknown"", I'm trying to say that we are scared of what we don't know and will do anything to comfort ourselves from abnormality.

YouTube making life harder for new and old creators trying to make a living!,"The algorithm for YouTube has changed in the past few years , with videos i have seen from middle 20000's. those have somehow vanished and no longer on the site nor app. It's very fustraiting when i hear from a creators channle i have followed say its kind of hard for them to make money when they i believe take away their viewings away from them if they don't got more than 1,000 views for a live or video. 

for the newer guys its even harder to get started and not even getting views or noticed half the time, and when u do get noticed after a few years. YouTube gets this funny idea to start flagging videos that to me haven't show anything inappropriate at all!

social media companies should never be held accountable for content moderation or be required to moderate content by the government.,"There is a big push on social media companies by the governments of countries around the world to increase content moderation.  In some cases the social media companies are threatened with legal action over content created by everyday people. I believe that this is wrong.

Social media companies are not media companies. They are a town square. They are a mall. They are the places that we all go to talk and share our ideas in perspectives. A Town square is not held accountable for people's inappropriate ideas or perspectives. Nor is a mall. 

A government has the responsibility of enforcing any restrictions on freedom of speech on its own citizens. I don't have a problem with them enforcing their rules on people but don't make a social media company do your police work .

To me this seems like common sense. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me as well as a lot of governments. I would like to better understand another perspective. To be clear I'm not stating that I think people should be able to say anything they want to I am also not sharing my perspective on freedom of speech. I am only sharing my perspective on the role that social media companies play in society today.",,,,,,,,
Total Abolitionists who wish to eliminate the prison system do not truly believe that (California CDCR perspective),"**Introduction**

Correctional Abolitionism is a rapid-growing ideology in today's society. Past social media and advocacy, the concept of abolitionism has entered law school forums and the legal curriculum itself. See from [Harvard](https://harvardcrcl.org/a-safe-and-flourishing-future-one-law-students-case-for-abolition/); [Columbia](https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/abolition-practicum); and [UCLA](https://law.ucla.edu/events/abolition-legal-field-discussion-about-abolitionism-classroom-and-beyond). (Note: These examples vary in approach; my argument will not be focused on these contents' paradigm.) As a personal anecdote, having attend various legal panels and seminars hosted on law school campuses, abolitionism seems to be more ""trending"" now more than ever.

This is not to say there are not issues with the current criminal law system and certain laws. For example, Three Strikes law still exists in California. There are many good arguments against it. But that point also envelops the solution: the law is constantly changing, and its amenable nature makes it imperative to work within its system to progress change rather than deconstruct it entirely.

I have had plenty of debate with abolitionists, from formal to informal settings, who have focused on various issues, i.e. racial disparities or the private prison complex, to justify total abolitionism. While these concerns have merit for discussion, these do not warrant the ""total abolitionist"" ideology. Instead, I see these abolitionists as highly opinionated and critical of the correctional system, but I do not believe any ""total abolitionist"" believes what they are claiming.

The ""total abolitionist"" perspective I am arguing against: ""**Abolition rejects the expansion of** [**all aspects of the prison industrial complex**](http://correctionsproject.com/wordpress/portfolio/prison-maps/#jp-carousel-644)**.** **This means eliminating prisons and police as well as removing “policing” from society.** ""

I do not believe any abolitionist truly believes in eliminating prisons, outside of it being a talking point. I am open to having my mind changed as I truly want to be convince of at least one reasonable argument. But I have yet to discover an argument consistent with viable solutions and incorporate enough nuance that merits any legitimate considerations. For my mind to be changed, I'd love all three premises to be reasonably challenged (in the context of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.)

**Context**

I am aware of people having tough times and making difficult life decisions / mistakes, and the importance for rehabilitation. Thanks to the correctional system, they gain vocational skills, college educations, and much needed self-help trainings and programming (i.e. CALPIA) to re-enter society. Another underrated aspect is developing suitable parole plans: Once they get out, where will they stay? Do they have a support network? Will they have work to sustain themselves? Will they be in the best position possible to not revert to criminal behavior? These are all services that my State provides to the inmate. These are measures so a former criminal who committed lewd and lascivious acts against a child do not get tempted when they see a child on the street. Someone who murdered someone for rejecting him develops the self-control needed to not do it again.

**Premises**

I believe abolitionists, specifically in California, who are against the correctional system are very uneducated on the subject; in fact, I truly believe **they don't believe** what they are arguing. The main premises for my position:

***1) Regarding total abolitionists - those who believe in fully abolishing the prison system - do not have viable nor practicable solutions for malicious crimes.***

The premise explains itself. Someone murders twelve kids. How does an abolitionist suppose we deal with them?

***2) The argument that criminal punishment should only focus on rehabilitation rather than be punitive unjustifiably undercut theories of retribution.***

Why should your ""perfect world"" views take precedent over hurting victims and their families who want to feel relief and justice? If it was my wife badly beaten and assaulted, I would want them to receive punishment. You would the same if someone kidnapped, assaulted, and murdered your nephews and nieces. Why do your outside feelings take precedent over those directly impacted?

***3) Our current system, and improving this system, is the best way to rehabilitate inmates.***

It's hard to see **how or why** an abolitionist would disagree with CDCR's approach. Rehabilitating and reducing recidivism is exactly what states have been doing through proper programming. A total abolitionist view seems more argumentative than substantive.

I'd include that in my State we are accommodating inmates more than than necessary -- in fact, we even allowed inmates to create their own podcasts distributed throughout prison radios. The State provides inmates commissary catalogues, allowing them to buy Nike shoes, watches, etc.

**Conclusion**

I think I made my points clear! Tl;dr total abolitionism / eliminating the prison system as a whole is more argumentative than substantive. It 1) does not provide practicable nor viable solutions for malicious crimes 2) rehabilitation &gt; punishment does not fit the script for every crime and is unfair to victim families and 3) our current system and improving it is the best balance between punishment and rehabilitation and the best way to rehabilitate inmates already. Withstanding these three premises, it is impossible for someone to truly believe in total abolitionism.",,,,,,,,
west started the new cold war,"Russia changed a lot after Soviet collapse. As a matter of fact, Russia tried to “change itself” from the very moment when Mikhail Gorbachev became “gensek” in 1985, and kept trying till 2002 (someone could say 2004, but let’s keep it low), in order to “join the European Union”, or however, to find a common language with the West (EU, USA, take your pick). And then it said “WTF”…

Gorbachev asked to join EU before 1991. He had done already (or was going to do) a lot: he had brought the boys back home from Afghanistan, he let the Germans tear down the Berlin Wall, he promoted “Glasnost” and Perestroyka” at home (in a quite voluntaristic and even a bit unthoughtful way, talking with hindsight, but anyway). But EU say “no”. The rationale was more or less the same you say now: “you are too big” (no pun intended).

Then they drove the old USSR down (and all the bells were singing, for a while). Russia went through what we all know, but few of us can really imagine (the life expectancy for men fell from 64 years in 1990 to 59 in 2000: nuff said). The local “liberals” whored out the same names and concepts of “liberalism” and “democracy” (do you know what “derhmocracy” means? Well, remember Cambronne…) in order to “change Russia” and join the West. And then there was Putin. But even Putin tried to “join EU”. After all, Russia was smaller than USSR. But it was “too big” yet for Brussels.

Meanwhile, with a decision that the great American diplomat George Kennan (the father of anti-Soviet “containment”, so, a man beyond any suspect) criticized to death (“it’s the beginning of a new cold war”, he said), the Clintonian USA had “supported” (euphemism) the first enlargement of NATO till the former Soviet borders, and stuffed EU with pro-American (and anti-Russian) proxies (through the action of UK, of course: a real US Troyan horse in the EU, as De Gaulle had forecasted).

So the attempts of Russia (and of the “Old Europeans”) to find a common language between Russia and EU (let alone to start the path toward an association of Russia, if not a full blown membership) became even harder, not to say impossible. And mostly NOT for Russian responsibility. Yes, there was the SECOND Chechen war. But, when Eltsin started the FIRST (without a provocation as the Basayev’s attack to Dagestan -August 1999-), Clinton praised him comparing him to Lincoln. So, what are we talking about?

And then there was September 11 (or as I prefer to call it: “the sequel of Rambo 3”). The Russians had warned USA for years about the danger the radical islamist groups they had created, funded, armed, trained or all-the-above-together could create to them too, and even offered their cooperation to contrast them, but proud USA always loftily dismissed this proposal, and let their former allies get them with their trousers down.

After the attack, Putin offered his sympathy and something more to Bush (intelligence cooperation, free passage to US supplies and even a base -Ulyanovsk- to support the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, plus the Russian-backed Northern Alliance as a boots-on-the-ground force against Al Qaida and the Talibans, etc.). What was the “thank you” for all of that? Bush announced the US withdrawal from ABM treaty, a pillar of MAD and of the power balance between Russia and USA. Go do such people a favor…

At that point, the goodwill of Russian toward “the West” was already quite low (it was 80% in 1990, 40% in 1999, 20% in 2002). The last straw came around 2004, when the NATO passed the borders of USSR with the entry of the Baltic states. Russians had already some axes to grind with them about the way they treated the local Russian-speaking minority (non-citizen status, treatments which are usual for immigrants applied to people born, living and working in the same country since decades, etc.), but to figure US bombers and missiles based just a few minutes away from Saint Petersburg was not the kind of things that could ease the mutual relations.

And indeed, they got worse. Not only with the Balts, but with the EU (they had entered there too, always thanks to UK -and Poland-), and let alone with the US of A.

It was in 2007, that Putin gave the famous Munich speech, which boiled down to a simple concept: “enough is enough: get lost!”. And the bulk of Russian people was fully agreeing with him.

As an epilogue, I will quote the words that a grinning Russian diplomat said to his Western colleagues some years ago, answering their shock about the increasing contacts between Russia and China: “If a girl tells a boy “NO” too many times, the boy looks for another girl”.",,,,,,,,
"We should be electing two governments, one for social issues and one for economics","As the title says, I believe that if we divided governments into two parts, it would be beneficial for everyone of us.

My main reasons for believing this is:

- We could separate our economic, social and political (For political I mean things like foreign politics) beliefs, so that someone who is, for example, socially conservative and more left leaning economically doesn't have to decide whether he values more his social or economical beliefs.

- As I said, we wouldn't have to trade our social or economic beliefs for their counterpart: this way, we don't risk being stuck with economic or social politics we don't like just because in that moment we value more the other one (I see this all the time: some people dislike most right-leaning social beliefs, but much prefer their economics).

- In my idea, there could not be any crossover between economic and social parties: this would make parties less divided and much more focused on their objectives, without the need to balance social politics and economics. Parties would also need to cater to a smaller audience, so that their beliefs would be a little less nuanced and less diluted.

Obviously, I recognize how some issues may arise from this:

- Some economic and political doctrines are somewhat incompatible with each other, making it harder for the two parts of the government to cooperate

- There isn't a hard divide between economics and social politics: they are extremely connected, to that also makes it harder for the two parts to cooperate. Defining what is the field of the economic government and what is the field of the social government could also be difficult.

However, I'd expect that it would be hard for completely opposite social and economic doctrines to find themselves in the government, as social beliefs are connected with economic beliefs and vice versa, so that I wouldn't expect, for example, to find democratic socialists and hardline conservatives together in the government. 

I'd also put an executive political figure that would try to unite the two parts and help them cooperate and harmonize their different beliefs (It could be an elected president or, as I would prefer, a monarch, or anything else.)

Why CMV: As much as I am interested in politics, I am no expert, so there is likely something serious I'm missing that would make this system crumble completely.",,,,,,,,
"We will redistribute wealth with UBI or first world society as we know it collapses, no other options","I would like my view changed so I can better understand why other people are not concerned about this. Is there something I don't know? AI is going to knock out most jobs, corporate profits will continue to rise. That is actually fine, just need to tax that money and redistribute it. 

Is there some third scenario I can't comprehend where most peoples jobs are knocked out, there is no UBI, and people continue to function normally?

It would be nice to see a less bleak future. Or it would be nice if people at least agreed on how to make the future not bleak.",,,,,,,,
"It is okay to be willfully ignorant, anti-intellectual and isolated as long as you don't hurt anyone else","I am a person unable to deal with the realization that moral nihilism is true, in the sense that stuff like stealing, rape and murder is not objectively wrong. All laws are arbitrary and the meaning behind the word ""should"" does not exist or is just used as meaning what is good for your selfish biological survival. It makes me depressed and makes me not want to fight for any ideals because it means I just value ideals for selfish reasons or pointless reasons.

I am a person too dumb to be an engineer and to old to be a soldier, but I am physically fit enough to have a job or do some kind of volunteer stuff. However, when I have tried doing all those things I just have to keep a mask on all the time and the exhaustion of it all means I arguably never truly contribute. I also definitely should not do political work since my fear of nihilism means I lean toward authoritarian stuff, like Plato's noble lie and censorship of art. I could easily become the useful idiots of fascists, since I sort of glorify enlightened dictatorships.

I am currently living on a sort of welfare agreement with the social services in my country. I am receiving welfare as long as I study. However, **I am only studying to stay on welfare,** not to study something to one day become smart and give back to society. I lack common sense and whatever other people have that causes them to believe and know something is true. I generally doubt things as much as possible by default.

Expected counter argument :""**You should try talking to a psychologist or philosophical counseling"".**  I had a digital appointment with philosopher that also had degree in psychology. I asked him if it was possible to be an atheist and believe in moral universalism, something like Kantian deontology for atheist's. He said no, and said he personally believe humans being have to chose a system and willfully lie to themselves to survive.  He was brutally honest, which I did not expect, but I guess I am glad he was. Well, I wish he told me lies to be honest, but it's too late now.

Expected counter argument 2: **You are not contributing anything to society.**  Yes, this is true. But this is sort of the point of my CMV, though. I mean, how exactly am I to contribute anyway? I guess having children is the most needed thing for western countries, but I think only fully mentally stable and healthy people should have children. It is better to have less children than more but they are unhappy or unsafe. Also, I do spend some of my money on consuming culture and support art. Well, actually art and stories make me sad as well.

I do not intend to harm anyone or steal (the exception to the stealing is being on welfare I guess). I think that everything I am doing should be seen as okay. I will avoid philosophy, which makes me depressed but not force anti-intellectualism on other people. I also won't be rude to people or not offer help in situations like where people fall over or ask me to hold a door open. I would also call the police and firemen if someone was in trouble, of course. I guess I will always behave so because of a holdover in my mind thinking those things are good or bad.

Want to me it clear I am open to changing my view. I actually want to since I think my view is seen as shameful and wrong.

Also, please don't recommend r/askphilosophy. They don't like questions like this and will remove it quickly, or I will have to rephrase it to the degree I will get no answer that is relevant to my actual individual situation.

Thank you for reading. If you have any questions feel free to ask!",,,,,,,,
"The people of the United States have the right to refer to their country as ""America"" if they want.","(Disclaimer: I'm not from the United States of America, but I'm also not Latin American either.)

I'm a huge believer in self-determination on scales as small as the individual and as large as nations. I generally think that groups of people should be allowed to determine who they are and how they want to show themselves to the world. Of course, we can never control other people's perception, but we can self identify and try to shape that perception. 

In recent years I've seen a lot of people (mostly on the internet) arguing that referring to the US as ""America"" is a misnomer because ""America"" refers to a continent (or two continents, depending on your worldview). I think this argument often comes from people living in Latin America, but there could be others, I'm not certain. I've seen some people argue this from a linguistics standpoint, like calling the US ""America"" is a grammatical error, and I've seen others make an anti-imperialist case, arguing that Americans (or United Statesians, maybe) are trying to assert themselves as the masters of the Western Hemisphere.

I think policing language is often (though certainly not always) unproductive. It seems to me like this is a case of outsiders (people not from the US) trying to police how people inside the US describe themselves. I think that Americans should be allowed to call themselves whatever they feel. Beyond this, I think the linguistic argument just doesn't work. Most North American english speakers don't think of ""America"" as being a word for a single continent, they think of ""North America"" and ""South America"" (or maybe ""The Americas"").",,,,,,,,
Celebrities shouldn’t get backlash for working with unethical brands.,"Celebrities always get a bunch of backlash for doing deals or working with companies who have done some unethical things. 

One example is athletes signed to Nike, I seen some people on Reddit bashing nba players for supporting and working with Nike despite them using child labour in developing countries. 

But why is it always the athletes or celebrities getting the backlash? What about the company actually putting kids to work? Or the millions of people buying Nike. 

Lebron James for example is signed to Nike. But Nike is paying him and promoting his product Lebron obviously gets a clear benefit from this. What’s the excuse for the average person who willingly spends hundreds to thousands of hard earned money at Nike each year though? They have no benefit and are actually paying a premium to shop at Nike.

In this instance I would say the average person is more guilty as they are supporting child labour for nothing and could spend less elsewhere. 

Not to mention you never hear Nike or Amazon employees get backlash but they work for and benefit from the same companies. What’s the difference between them and an athlete sponsor they both work with the company for a paycheque and could go elsewhere.",,,,,,,,
there is no reason to assume animals can’t experience love like we can.,"A question I keep asking myself is this: why do people act like every instance of animals showing affection can be explained away as different than ours?

I’ve heard people say things like “dogs don’t really love you, they just love that you give them food.” And I guess I just don’t really understand because we could do the same with humans if we applied that logic consistently. 

“Oh, you don’t really love your family. You’re just conditioned to show them affection because they raised you and gave you food. You’re biologically wired to stick close to them because often times that would have given you a bigger chance for survival in the wild.”

Why are people so determined to separate themselves from animals? Sure humans are different from a lot of other species in the world, but every species is unique. If the affection shown by animals isn’t indicative of love, then how can we say that the affection we feel and show is? 

I guess I should clarify I am not speaking about all animals here, but mostly about mammals who have an amygdala. 

If we’re willing to call our own biological feelings “love” then I don’t get why we can’t call that of animals the same.",,,,,,,,
"USD isnt worth it anymore. The amount of time it takes to earn X amount of dollars, isn't worth the goods it can afford. Most employment is a means of imprisonment in a downward spiral of standard of living.","The time needed to care for ones self to maintain their health, is nickeled and dimed away from them for USD amounts which dont well reflect the implicated costs of healthcare which arise from stress, injuries, diet stressors, lack of flexibility in what and when to eat or rest, or even accomodate medical intervention appointments.

The time needed to pay for childcare at median wages, is not worth the USD recieved by working instead. The cost of daily transporting the child, supplying daycare with extra supplies which may have been made more cost efficient by having the flexibility to manage on a schedule at home, deposits, and the costs of losing work to go pick them up in emergency or sickness; as one still pays the entire month cost regardless of their absences at daycare, but at work, one still loses all their pay for those absences which are spent attending to the child not at daycare.

Median wages are not enough to have secure and reliable access to appropriate healthcare, dental too.

Median wages are not enough to accomodate sustainable finances for individuals or families. One healthcare incident, broken tooth, car or transport issue, eviction, job loss, fall down the stairs, a bonk on the head, a cyst, cancer, a heart attack, a baby, a legal accusation, a divorce, a disease, someone just not liking you and termintating/sabotaging/etc you, a rape or sexual abuse event, an imprisonment for a crime you did or did not commit, a traffic stop cop who wants to fuck with you, a car wreck, a missed bill, a fire, theft, even a mere misunderstanding, layoffs, and so much more...
Are all VERY capable of irreperable loss, snowball exacerbations of one another, homelessness, losing your family, home, health, or even losing access to the paltry government support services which are already inadequate.

Its cute when people tell me they're 'doing fine.'.. Vast majority of the United States citizens will be fumbling to explain how 'this is crazy, you dont understand, i wasnt always like this...its just that...well you see..' Mhm. You can work hard as a mf'r, let yourself be exploited with a smile, but you aren't gonna come out with any different odds than every other person, bud. 
Spare us of the hubris, you aren't more hardworking than most poor people. You just haven't had your time yet. Time is ticking, and youre not in control. All life needs is a little, tiny, nick in the glass for the whole thing to begin to crack and then shatter.

Dependency on USD is an irresponsible approach to life. For well over half the nation, employment doesnt provide enough income to justify the costs of time lost to work. Nor does it provide any pragmatic means of provisioning one with the ability to reliably provide basic needs to themselves or even their children. I wouldnt peg it as an approach of being a responsible parent, anymore. The costs, even through an optimistic lens, outweigh the gains of employment.

Considering all this, I reflect on the reason we 'need' USD. It doesnt grow plants, it isnt land i can live on, isnt edible, doesnt light up, doesnt watch my children, doesnt heal my body... It is because even the very basic needs of life, food, land, safety, etc. are actively withheld from us, hostage until we sell our time for USD to often the same entities which take that USD and only then allow us an arbitrary amount of resources for it.

Fleets, millions of tonnes, of food that wasnt bought, toys unopened, tools unused, medications unused and so much more are buried in landfills en masse daily. Not because nobody needed them. Not because nobody wanted them. Quite the opposite. It was done as a result of ensuring that they were withheld from people who needed or wanted them, but didnt have more USD to give for them. Millions of tonnes a day, buried in the earth, specifically to make sure nobody could have them; because nobody had come forth with the USD to give for them. Regardless of a dying human, a child with special needs, any regard for other species, international needs, repurposing concepts, charities, or just making the lives easier for the working people of the nation who sacrifice everything to keep things running. Without infldulging further into it, full automation is not 'ways away', it is coming, faster and faster. Artificial scarcity is well known and observed.

Employment wages are no longer an efficient or practical approach for meeting the needs of over half the country. USD is a lost cause, as it is not amidst an economic architecure which enables any degree of functional circulating rate before being heavily reconcentrated amidst a small group. 

It is not responsible as a parent to continue the idea of employment being the right answer. Our children's lives are at stake, and we devote nearly all our waking hours to an ideal and corporations which knowingly exploit us; and leave us unable to provide or fight for a respectable life for our children.

We have a fiduciary duty to our children, yet we do not act in their best interest as parents, by giving away our time and labor for less than appropriate prices. Its legally arguable that you are abusive and a failure as a parent; by not withholding labor, ideally collectively, to demand for far higher wages to provide for yourself and your child.

This includes me, too. I'm failing my son by conceding my labor away for so little. He barely knows me, as I have to work so much. We have so little, and have lost even more.

it’s fine if you’re a “trans” woman but you are still not a woman.,"The term woman should only refer to a biological woman, not somebody who transitioned. I, along with the majority of straight men, am only attracted to a biological woman. If I were single and a trans woman wanted to go on a date I would decline. Not because I’m homophobic or don’t agree with their transition, it’s because that’s simply what I want. If you want to refer to yourself as a trans woman, that’s fine but you need the “trans” in there. You can’t lie to people and call yourself a biological woman or that’s pretty much just a catfish. You should always be straight forward about it. You can look like a woman but you are in fact and always will be a “trans” woman. That 4 letter word is very important.",,,,,,,,
The prison sentence for killing someone while driving drunk should be an automatic life sentence.,"Normally, life sentences are for people guilty of Murder 1 or Murder 2. A majority of people who kill someone while driving drunk fall under involuntary vehicular manslaughter. 

That makes sense.

If you cause an accident and someone else dies, but you were sober while behind the wheel, as long as you didn't do something egregiously negligent, I get it. It happens. It's unfortunate, but it happens.

HOWEVER, I am certain that 99% of people who drive drunk drank voluntarily and voluntarily got behind the wheel knowing they were drunk. Factoring that into consideration, if you cause a fatal accident when you voluntarily drank and voluntarily got behind the wheel of a two-ton machine while you knew you were drunk, you are the literal scum of the earth and a selfish irresponsible human being.

Because you put yourself in an inebriated state ON YOUR OWN VOLITION and while in said inebriated state got behind the wheel ON YOUR OWN VOLITION and caused a fatal accident, your charge should still be vehicular manslaughter, but your prison sentence should be the same as if you committed 1st or 2nd degree murder.",,,,,,,,
Expressing Anger in Public is Not Good,"Have you ever seen someone flip out in public over the littlest thing? Do you think that that’s ever acceptable or that angry outbursts are just a normal part of life? Or do you think that we should keep our anger out of the public space if it isn't in direct response to unkindness or discrimination or something. I was talking to my friend the other day about anger, and he says he loves being angry in public. He thinks it's more cathartic to get angry and have people see it. He says it makes him feel understood or seen or something? I don't get that at all. I saw a girl the other night start screaming at a pizza shop because they didn’t have pepperoni. Then she burst into tears and I overheard her tragic backstory of what seemed like a really tough year. 

I feel like this may be a gendered and cultural issue as well, because I was raised in a culture that discouraged anger and presented shame and sadness as an alternative. So for me, if I was ever angry, I would usually just cry. I also came from a household where anger, even if it existed in the interactions that I had, were always hidden in the household. Like when I was little, and I had done something to upset my mom, she would turn to me and grit her teeth and whisper to me to wait until we got home.

I can imagine the importance of anger in resistance or reaction to like discrimination or as a form of activism. That makes sense, even if I couldn’t personally do it. But anger that’s personal should not be displayed in public because it causes an upset to everyone and you are pushing it onto everyone else. But also I can understand how it might be beneficial to express it out loud, and how doing something out loud for people to see might make it more likely for someone to help you. Or maybe even just for you to understand your own feelings by expressing anger in a place where you see other people’s reactions. 

After seeing that girl cry she seemed like her friends were nicer to her, not meaner to her after, and I found that unusual. She didn’t even apologize to the worker. Anyway, what do you think? Have you ever been in a situation like that? Losing your temper and then feeling better? 

Have you guys ever had a public angry outburst? Have you seen someone else have one? What happened? Did they get in trouble? Did they calm down after they stopped yelling or just get amped up? I’ve seen some people freak out on friends, workers, and even strangers before on the street. What's the craziest thing you’ve ever seen?  Do you think it helps to be angry in public?",,,,,,,,
Progressives are making political polarization worse by stoking/encouraging tribalism,"Im probably going to be gaslit into being told this doesn’t happen, but basically I’ve interacted with many progressives in real life, as well as consumed a lot of progressive media, and progressives often espouse narratives that are highly critical of white, straight, and/or male identity or characteristics as having unfair, undue, or problematic influence in society.

This is stoking tribalism and polarization, because when you whole sale categorize and judge an entire one group of people based on one singular  basic characteristic, you inevitably mischaracterized enough “exceptions” that your world view begins to come across as reductionist at best. 

Furthermore, judging a group of people based on one singular characteristic is just…unfair and wrong. But when this is called out, progressives defend it. Worse, progressives establish double standards.

It’s okay to get upset at “white people” in general for being racist, but if black people or Hispanic people are racist it’s somehow- excused. If Christians are homophobic it causes an uproar- if Muslims are homophobic the conversation goes “what about Christians!!1”. If men are abusive it’s wrong- but if women are abusive it’s seen as not serious.

I can’t in honest believe that progressives are arguing for an equal society in good faith when, in practice, it seems progressives are just trying to normalize bigotry and prejudice towards groups they have grievances against.",,,,,,,,
The war in Afghanistan was *always* going to turn out this way.,"Afghanistan isn't viewed as a country to the majority of the Afghan people. It's a massive area of land filled with different tribes that *don't want to* modernize. 

The US and our allies could've stayed another 40 years, but the Taliban was always going to come back as soon as we left. Afghanistan will never be able to get its shit together with outside help. They have to do it themselves.

The US and our allies made schools, hospitals, and so much more just for them to give up immediately and lose it all in two weeks. 

All of that time wasted for nothing. I've got family members that were killed in that stupid fucking war. And for what?

Nothing.

The term cracker is as bad if not worse than the N-Word,"Obligatory “if you won’t even say the other word that one is worse” I refuse to say the N  word because I’m not black and they’ve made it that even using it like this will mean I’m racist and most likely get me banned from Reddit so I’ll continue to use “N word”.

So here’s why I say this. Cracker is a horrible racial slur used against white people that was thought up around the same time as the n-word. It is a term initially used to describe poor southern white people. White people who were objectively oppressed by the rich landowners of the south (the same people who were oppressing slaves). 

This term was then reclaimed by the poor people that it was attached to and became a point of pride, (like another word). However, in the 60s it was then appropriated by blacks who decided to make the term a good old fashion racial slur. Used to slander white people as racists (ironic) and make white people feel lesser.

So the word cracker is a parallel to the n-word in terms of the history of oppression behind it and the reclaiming of the word. For this reason it is historically equivalent. Do it is just as bad of a word and should be considered of the same level of racial slur.

However the n word was not then taken away after becoming a point of pride. It became a racial slur that is just acceptable. This is where I think it in many ways becomes worse. If I go down the street and get called a cracker no one will care in fact people will call me racist for being offended. If I call a black person their equivalent of cracker I’ll probably get shot and everyone will say I deserve it.

It’s worse because it’s acceptable and common. Because no one cares about white peoples who experience racism. Because after you get called it you get no sympathy, just hate.",,,,,,,,
People who hate life should just go,"I know that this sounds terrible. I want my opinion to change, so here I am. 

There are those people who wake up every single day in a bad mood. Those who have no interests in life, aren't excited about anything, and every single day they just want the day to pass, and every day is like this. Those people might have people who love them and who can't give them up, who feel responsible for them. But no matter what their loved ones do, those life-unexcited people don't change. They keep waking up in a bad mood, having a bad day, and making everyone else's day bad too. The closer you are to such a dementor person, the more you are affected by them and their moods. 

I understand that people like this are severely depressed and need help. Some even get help for years and years but nothing really changes. They live their miserable lives and make lives of their loved ones miserable too. So, seriously, just go. Don't torture yourself, and don't torture everyone around. You're not going to be a productive member of the society, and you don't want life anyways, so there's no reason to stay, unless you're working your ass off to get better and hoping to end up being happy finally. But if they don't want that, they should just go.",,,,,,,,
We are using the word Incel way too loosely and way too frequently and it’s damaging and dangerous,"I get the impression that there are a large group of extremist anti-Incel people online. These angry self-righteous condescending know-it-alls seem to not be able to tell the difference between an Incel (i.e. a group of violent misogynist who hate women and who feel that people all them sex) and genuine innocent people who struggle to form sexual relationships. Let’s call the latter group compulsory virgins. I know it’s not a very accurate term because someone might not be a virgin but still be dissatisfied with their sex life, but it’s the best I can think of so let’s stick with compulsory virgins (CV) for this post. 

CVs are by definition innocent and free of any hatred or misogyny

But from my experience when a CV dares to talk about their struggles in the dating field, or expresses so much as a minute hint of frustration at their situation, they are labelled as Incel. “oh that’s incel-ish“, “oh you’re a loser, you’re giving off incel vibes”. 

Suppose there’s a football player, let’s call him Barry. Barry is a very skilled and passionate player, and wants to join a football team. This football team persistently rejects Barry. The football team is known to be very cliquey. They generally only allow their tight group of friends and family to join the team. The manager has a strong bias towards short players, who he sees as fast and agile, will dismiss anyone who is above a certain height. (These are all examples, the details don’t matter.)

Barry finds this mildly frustrating. He’s kind of annoyed, but *he also recognises that the football team is a private enterprise, they can play with whoever they choose to play with, and they don’t owe him a position on the team, and that they don’t owe him anything*

So the angry extremist anti-Incel version of this would come along and say 

- that Barry is a loser, 
- he’s resentful and spiteful, 
- he is on a slippery slope to hating all football teams, 
- he has no right to be frustrated because the team does not owe him anything, 
- Barry is at risk of becoming radicalised, he will soon have urges to BURN down the football club and slaughter all of its members 
- he will want to join violent hate groups and crime groups to eradicate said football team. 
- Barry is a disgusting pig and should be shunned from society

Would you want to hear this if you were Barry? 

Where is the reality of the situation is that in 99.99999% of the cases Barry would probably, after voicing his concerns and frustrations and having a bit of a vent within some support group, would either just train so hard so as to become too good of a player to reject, or just move to a different town, or think of a different sport, or make friends with the manager in the team so he’s invited into the club, or just forget about the whole thing and live his life. 

I agree that there might be a degree of spectrum between a CV and an Incel, but *if we are defining an Incel to be someone who is despicable, feels people owe them sex, violently misogynistic and filled with hate and crime, then we cannot throw this word around to describe an innocent CV. This will ostracise, upset, infuriate, and ultimately risk radicalising a vast contingent of CVs who would otherwise I’ve just figured something out for themselves and moved on with life and found happiness and good relationships*

And just for the record, no I’m not an Incel. I am an ex-CV, who luckily managed to avoid all of this extreme Incel hunting witch burning rhetoric, and managed to get to a place where now I can have a fruitful and satisfying sex life. 
The only reason I’m mentioning that is because I don’t want people to come at me with personal attacks. 

The bottom line TLDR of this is it’s entirely possible to denounce Incels while also affording a degree of understanding and compassion and sympathy for the struggles and frustrations of innocent CVs who struggle to form sexual connections. The same way that you would afford sympathy to someone who can’t make friends, or someone who has no family, or someone who can’t sing, or someone who has no legs, or someone who can’t play football.

Walgreen’s refuses to sell mifepristone in states where chemical abortion is legal. This is wrong.,"It’s unethical and dystopian for National business chain pharmacy to arbitrarily block the sale of a drug that interferes with the safe and efficient completion of a medical procedure that is legal in a state. This is what has I occurred  in CA. Chemical pregnancy termination is legal in CA and mifepristone in integral to the expedient, less painful completion of the procedure.
We are not talking about the refusal of two religious conservatives refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The consequences of a birth can be life long for the parent(s) and the child.

Inclusivity is an illusion of progress and is the destruction of excellence,"Oh boy, I know it's controversial, but this is how I feel. So I'd like some good counter-arguments.

Inclusivity is a destructive and misguided policy that has led to the degradation of our society and our values. The push for diversity and inclusivity has created an environment where individuals are judged not by their abilities or achievements, but by their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other irrelevant characteristics.

The promotion of inclusivity has led to the creation of quotas and affirmative action programs that discriminate against individuals who are not part of certain minority groups. This policy is not only unfair, but it also undermines the very principles of meritocracy and hard work that our society was built on.

In addition, the emphasis on inclusivity has led to the suppression of free speech and the stifling of dissenting opinions. Individuals who express opinions that are not in line with the current progressive narrative are often ostracized, cancelled, or even fired from their jobs. This is not the society that our forefathers envisioned, where individuals had the right to express their opinions without fear of retribution or persecution.

Moreover, the concept of inclusivity ignores the reality that individuals from different backgrounds may have vastly different values, beliefs, and cultural practices that may not align with each other. The push for inclusivity has created an environment where individuals are forced to accept and celebrate lifestyles and values that are not in line with their own. This is not only impractical but also impossible.

In conclusion, the promotion of inclusivity and diversity is a flawed and misguided policy that undermines the very fabric of our society. We must reject this policy and return to a system that values hard work, talent, and individual achievement, regardless of an individual's background or identity. Only by doing so can we restore the values and principles that made our society great.",,,,,,,,
gun control doesn't work instead we should be for guns,did you know that nikolas cruz and the las vegas shooter bought their guns legally? did you know that the buffalo shooter in nyc bought his gun legally? did you know that one of the safest gun law countries is brazil and does gun control work there? it doesn't. gun control simply does not work because it clearly shows that the appeal in restricting guns for fewer gun related crimes does not work in america. gun control laws do not show a persons intent. i a sane person can pass all background checks and legally purchase a gun but i can still have the intent of a mass shooting. if guns were to be banned then only outlaws will have guns. more guns will cause less crime beacuse every criminal will have to have a second thought before commiting a crime.,,,,,,,,
"MODERN Conservatives/Republicans (or whatever) are PRIMARILY a ""supremacy"" group.","Modern as in 2016 onwards, Not to be confused with pre-2016 conservatives. Most of the MODERN conservatives want to be (or feel) SUPERIOR to others. With key slogans and catch phrases such as ""Liberal tears,"" ""Lets Go Brandon (F*CK Joe Biden),"" ""Own the Libs,"" one asks, what are their key stances on such? So far, they are primarily focused on the ""cultural war."" Which means that people who fit into cultures, such as LGBTQ, gender, and race, will be under scrutiny.

During the 2020 election, sure the inflation and oil was an issue, BUT modern conservatives FAILED to CLEARLY propose SOLUTIONS to that problem, but focused on the ""culture war."" That ultimately costed them the election.

Currently, the biggest political issue is TRANS people. MTG had a sign that said ""Trust the Science."" NOW she believes science? Where was that energy during the COVID era? She is ONLY doing that because the goal of MODERN conservatism is ""superiority."" 

They need SOMEONE to ""feel"" superior to. And lets say they do pass anti-trans laws. Would they want to come together? Nope. Would they work for a compromise (although for issues like LGBTQ rights, there are NO compromises)? Nope. They would say ""Winner, winner, here's my prize. You are a loser who sits and cries.""

Examples of MODERN Conservatives would be:
- Trump
- Gates
- Boebert
- MTG
- DeSantis
- Abbot

Examples of TRADITIONAL Republicans would be
- McCain
- Romney
- Liz Cheney

Examples of GRIFTERS (follow the $$$ / votes)
- Shapiro
- Crowder
- Tucker Carlson
- Praeger
- 90% of conservative podcasts, TV personalities, vloggers, etc.
- Hawley (he deserves special mention)

For Hawley, he MIGHT be ""Modern,"" but he IS intelligent. He can easily switch back and forth. He is the most THREATENING to LGBTQs, females, non-whites, and non-Christians. If he becomes president, if he wanted to, he WILL make anyone who is NON white, male, Christian, straight feel subhuman.",,,,,,,,
The cliche of marriage being expensive is flat out wrong considering the value of combining resources,"It's been a common trope that marriage is expensive. jokes have been made about it on sitcoms, in cartoons, stand up comedy routines etc but that legitimately couldn't be further from the truth.

For nearly everyone the main expense they have is housing, for most people it consumes between 20 and 50% of their income. This really cannot be changed, especially in major cities where there is a very real lower limit to how much rooms, apartments, and houses cost, even in ""undesirable"" areas.

[Americans are increasingly burdened by rent](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-burden) and with skyrocketing housing costs for many it's the only way they can get housing.

But marriage, or a significant other you live with, is a big help to this on an individual level. Each partner cuts their rent expenses in half once they move in with each other, many stop needing roommates entirely because 2 people can live in a studio or one bedroom apartment. There are people who are able to live with multiple people in one bedroom apartments using bed sheets as walls, however, this is illegal in many jurisdictions due to zoning restrictions. 


With (roughly) twice the income, and twice the necessities, married couples often can better utilize buying in bulk, without worrying about food going bad prematurely, or that 18 pack of paper towels being enough to overdraw your bank account. This brings the cost per unit of necessities like groceries down as well. Buying in bulk has such a drastic effect on people's finances that it's been cited as a factor that [keeps poor families poor](https://www.wpr.org/study-low-income-households-miss-out-savings-because-they-cant-afford-buy-bulk)


I cannot think of anything that gets *more* expensive per person when one gets married, due to the simple fact that combining resources is so effective at reducing costs.",,,,,,,,
Taiwan is doomed. China's gonna invade it any time soon. Maybe it'll even lead to WW3,"I know this is a controversial and depressing topic, but I can’t help feeling hopeless about Taiwan’s future. China has been significantly ramping up its military pressure on Taiwan for years, especially in the past few months. And I'm starting to feel like it'll end up boiling down to two bitter choices: A, China basically does another Hong Kong but with more soldiers (you know, an invasion of some sorts) and succeeds, or B, countries like the US and Japan end up basically starting WW3 by rushing to Taiwan's aid, possibly involving nukes and stuff. Yeah, not pretty either way.

Some people say that China is just bluffing or testing Taiwan’s resolve, and that they don’t really want a war. Some doubt China's capability to carry out a meaningful invasion, maybe citing domestic issues. But I feel like these arguments largely come from wishful/magical thinking or denial of reality. [China has made it clear that it considers Taiwan as an integral part of its territory.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/china/china-taiwan-conflict-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html) I just can't see Taiwan standing their ground against the invaders, and I'm skeptical the US would want to intervene because, uh, nukes. Or maybe they will because they're the US.

And I feel like many people right now are so used to the status quo that they think it'll last for the rest of their lives, but that's certainly not happening. I wish I could be more optimistic; but especially considering the ""optimistic"" arguments concerning Russia vs. Ukraine I don’t see any evidence or reason to support that view.",,,,,,,,
Capitalism is the best economic system,"For the record, I'm not advocating for complete unregulated laissez-faire capitalism. I'm all in favor of certain things being public, such as education, health care, law enforcement, emergency services, roads and transportation, etc. I'm also in favor of regulations in order to do things like protect the environment, protect workers, etc. However, generally speaking, an economic system that is primarily characterized by private ownership, private property, profit driven businesses, etc. is the best economic system possible. To be clear, a lot of people seem to salivate over Scandinavian countries (like Denmark, for example), which are still capitalist countries. 

Obviously, capitalism has its flaws, but it is by far better than any alternative. Capitalism takes advantage of human nature and creates the proper incentives that facilitate the strongest economy. Compared to the alternatives, capitalism generally also results in better, higher quality, products. 

Compare that to the primary alternatives, which are socialism and communism. These systems have been complete failures every time they have been implemented. Some people argue that they failed due to Western influence, which is honestly just copium. These systems simply do not work because they don't mesh with human nature. Under these systems, the only result is poverty becoming much worse and more widespread, less overall production, and lower quality products being produced. 

I understand why a lot of people, usually young people, are disgruntled about capitalism, but what these people need to realize is that a lot of their complaints stem from the fact that life just kinda sucks in general. You can fantasize about a perfect idealized utopia all you want. It's simply never going to happen. Things like social hierarchy, economic scarcity, and human nature in general will always be the reality of life. Capitalism is the best we can do. Deal with it.",,,,,,,,
"For small countries locked in a rivalry with a superpower, it only makes sense for them to develop a nuclear program with strike capability.","What the US invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have shown is that world powers are capable of anything to enforce their political agendas. A sovereign country that is in bad relations with a world power must generate a nuclear program capable of attacking those world powers or their allies. It is the only life insurance that these countries have to ensure that they are not annihilated or become involved in a war that will destroy them economically.  

If Taiwan had the nuclear capacity to attack China, power relations and negotiations would be different, therefore the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons only favors world powers.  That can be applied to both North Korea and Iran currently.",,,,,,,,
Modern Feminism is No Longer About Equality,"To clarify before y'all come for my head, I absolutely support gender equality in every traditional sense. I'm pro choice, have had roughly the same number of guy and girl friends in my life, and fully believe that women are just as capable in every mental arena as men. That being said, what the fuck are we doing here?

More women than men attend college. Women can be doctors and lawyers and win the popular vote for President and nobody bats an eye. The wage gap exists on paper, but economists have debunked it repeatedly: women tend to choose less lucrative career paths more frequently and take more time off for family/personal reasons (men are also more likely to *seek* the high paid executive jobs and negotiate their salary when hired). This isn't the 1960s, nor is it the Middle East: to say women are held down by some phantom patriarchal force is both disrespectful to them and flat-out inaccurate.

Additionally, women also have certain societal advantages. They disproportionately win custody battles and do better in divorces. They have an easier time getting romantic attention (admittedly a double-edged sword, but still). They are allowed to display more emotion with less riducle. And more and more, they enjoy the social benefits of being from a ""marginalized"" group without much of the struggles faced by other such subsets (minorities, LGTBQ, disabled people etc.)

This really clicked for me when I tuned into ESPN tonight for some basketball and realized they were doing all-female broadcast teams for International Women's Day. I get it, it's a fine gesture, but the ESPN crew is essentially 50/50 gender-wise as is. Additionally, I'd be willing to bet that the network's viewership demographics are more along the lines of 80/20 male. In short, they are already an equal opportunity workplace in a sausage-dominanted field, but that clearly isn't enough for some people: I feel this is because the modern feminist wants to ""win"" a gender war more so than they want actual equality.

I have tremendous respect for first and second wave feminists (my own mother was the first female engineer at several different workplaces in the 1980s). I don't want to be a misogynist, but it feels like I'd be characterized as one by many in 2023. What am I missing about this third wave, and how can I correct my thinking?",,,,,,,,
My 26M Girlfriend 26F just told me about having HPV when I went to get checked for STD’s. Advice?,"My 26M girlfriend 26F and I have been together for almost 15 months. We’ve had the talks about STD’s and whether each other are clean and this whole time she’s told me that she’s clean etc. Anyway, I’ve been having some weird symptoms so I decided to get a physical exam and get some blood work done for a panel of STD’s. Anyway, I expressed that I’m anxious to get the results and she mentions now that she had HPV when she was 19 but that it’s no big deal because it goes away. I immediately got mad because of the whole time we’ve been together and the times we have talked about STD’s this is the first time she’s told me that she has had HPV in the past. She told me she forgot and that it just now jogged her memory and she forget. I’m a bit irritated at this and I need advice. Thank you!

My (22m) relationship has ended with ex (20f) and I feel alone,"My ex of almost 2 years and I finally broke up for good this week and I know I made the right decision but I feel completely alone right now. We had our issues for a long time, and I had stopped arguing with her for months and all seemed well. However, one day after we had sex she emptied my used condom into her to try and get pregnant and she did. I told her that was insane and she should abort that baby because I will have no part in raising a child you forced on me. 

She eventually got the abortion but then she told me she wanted to be friends with a coworker that I know likes her and wants to be with her.  I told her no and if she wants to she can leave me. I told her that I was unhappy with her for all of the issues that she was creating and she was making my life worse. 

Everything was fine until one day he followed her on instagram and she followed him back. She called me to say she had no feelings for me anymore and I said I didn’t either and we broke up. I believe she cheated on me with him even though she says she didn’t like him. 

Ever since the breakup I feel alone because I live by myself, and my family is all older and I have no siblings. Its hard to talk to people because I have to reach out. I’ve been seeing my friends more and going to events with them but I still feel emptiness inside. I know I can never get back with her but I feel horrible in those moments where I am alone and I realize that I was right about her the whole time. I feel so stupid for not leaving sooner when I first saw how the coworker talked to her.

Tldr: broke up with gf who tried to force a kid on me but i’m sad because i live alone and dont talk to anyone",,,,,,,,
my abusive boyfriend cheated on me,"i’m f21, he’s m24! tl;dr

i was laying in bed yesterday and he left his phone open to go to the bathroom so i took my chance and went thru his phone bc he always does that to me and finds stuff i did in the PAST, before i even knew him. and guess what i found??? we’ve been together since november last year and i found a message from a girl in february saying ‘i’ve been thinking and i don’t wanna do this anymore it’s a bit much for me, i wanna be free.. you keep saying i can’t meet other guys and i wanna do that.. sorry’

so obviously i got mad and went off on him saying ‘lmao yk what’s so funny? the fact that you’re so fucking double standard and then i started saying how i wanna leave him bc this was finally the last straw for me!
so he started defending himself saying that it’s nothing and that he did nothing wrong and how he used to sleep w and have a thing with her way before him and i started dating like okay?? why r u still talking to her and if it’s ‘nothing’ then why the fuck did she text you this in FEBRUARY???

it’s so weird to me that he gets mad at me for doing stuff way before i knew him but it’s stupid when i get mad after seeing this? 

and a few months ago i saw him snapping this girl so i mentioned it back then asking who she was and he said that she’s ‘just a costumer’ bc he’s also a plug, and so yesterday i noticed that he changed her name to ‘oscar’ like? you say ur not gulity of anything but you changed her name?

we started fighting ab it and he was like ‘i had to change her name otherwise you’d question it again’ like yeah? obviously? and then he was like ‘i would understand if you left me for something bigger, if i actually did cheat but i haven’t done anything so you’re leaving for the smallest reason’ he thinks i’m stupid honestly

he’s done so much to me and i’m so dumb for not leaving before, he’s hit me n forced himself on me n stuff! i told him that i should’ve left the first time he laid his hands on me. then he started crying and was like ‘you can’t leave me, no no no i won’t ever lose you, i’m so in love with you’ stfu honestly, i explained to him that that’s not his choice but he doesn’t get it and thinks he has a say in it.

and then this morning i kept telling him i don’t want anything to do w him and that it is over but he just won’t accept it bc ‘he’s so in love with me’ and then he started crying so i had to comfort him saying that it’s okay otherwise he couldn’t go to work today bc i ‘made him so sad and stressed’ but i truly am done so i’m gonna pack all his shit and actually stand my ground this time, i don’t deserve this

we’re both at work now and he keeps texting me like nothing ever happened",,,,,,,,
Bitterness towards my (F22) sister (F20),"So I’ve recently come to realize that I am developing bitterness towards my sister. We used to be close and had a good relationship up until a few months ago. We don’t really talk a lot and rarely see each other. We both still live at home but I work full time and she is a student and is at her boyfriend’s place most of the time these days. 

I think most of this bitterness comes from when we were younger and how she acted (and sometimes still acts the same way now) when we were teenagers. 

The first memorable thing that comes to mind is when I was 19 and she was 17. She screamed at me in front of our parents about how I was spoiled and always get what I want and how it’s unfair. The context behind this is that I had just got my license and my brother was in the process of buying a new car. He offered me his old car (which was a beat up honda with over 200k KMs on it) and of course I wanted it! I would’ve been crazy to not take a free car. Of course it had some small repairs that needed to be done which my father generously paid for as an early birthday gift to me. But other than those repairs to get it running, I paid for everything else to maintain that car. I paid for insurance, maintenance, new tires, etc. What I never understood is how mad my sister got about this. She didn’t even have her license and the car wasn’t worth much anyways. Why was it my fault that my brother offered me the car when it made the most sense for it to go to me? She was still in high school and I was already working full time and needed to get around. I even told her that she could have the car once I got a new one (I only had the car for a year before I got a new job and was able to afford a better one for myself). The thing that really bothered me about this whole situation is that I would have been insane to not take the car. I had never been offered such a gift in my life. She called me spoiled but that was the only thing she could come up with when I asked her how I was spoiled.

Another thing I hold bitterness towards is how she acts towards our parents. My mother is asian and if anyone has foreign parents, you know how stubborn they can be. When my sister was 18 she was never not having screaming matches with my mom. But the thing was, she was always instigating them. She would keep egging my mom on until eventually my mom would get really mad at her. 

She would constantly not help around the house (like chores) and say she was too busy with university. But I could always hear her yelling playing video games with friends. Recently, my mom asked her to put away the dishes and she said “No, because I don’t eat here.” Like bro. They are literally letting you live here rent free and they still pay for your fucking phone bill and you won’t do something as simple as put away the dishes? As soon as I turned 18, it was: “good luck, we’re not paying for anything anymore.” I pay for all of my own things. I paid for my way through school. I pay them rent for living at home. 

We got a dog a couple years ago with the condition that everyone in the family contributes to it. I consistently pay for his dog food, grooming, and paid for most of the essentials we needed for him as a puppy. I paid for his puppy school. I have never seen her contribute anything for him. She only lets him outside to go potty sometimes. 

She always uses my toothpaste, shampoo, Q-tips, hairbrushes, literally whatever is mine that’s in our shared bathroom. She is 20 years old and I have never seen her buy her own toothpaste or soap. We share the bathroom but I am always the one to clean it. She leaves her wet clothes in the wash and leaves the house so no one else can do their laundry until she comes back. 

Rant over I guess.

TLDR; Bitter towards sister because of things that happened when we were growing up.",,,,,,,,
Girlfriends (F26) dog is aggressive and bites. (NB25),"I am 25 yr nonbinary person  and my partner is a 26yr female. We have been seeing each other for about 6 months. She owns a 5yr boxer mix that is anxious and reactive. In the last couple months he has bit a family friend that has watched him several times, my partners 8 yr old sister, and has made several attempts at biting me. He is a resource guarder, growls if you approach his kennel, and growls every morning that I hug her goodbye before work. This morning her tried to bite me for the 3rd time and I’m honestly fed up. We have talked about the severity of the issue and that he needs professional training. I have offered to pay for 1/2 of the training and have offered to help her with training as needed. She put off enrolling him in training for 2 months after the last attack because she doesn’t think the situation is that serious. Thankfully he did get enrolled to start next week after our last argument.
My issue is I keep hearing from trainers online that the aggression issue will never be fully taken care of in most dog. My partner also has said that after the initial training courses are done she doesn’t want to keep doing the training or paying for it because it’s a nuisance. 
We have tired many training techniques found online but nothing seems to stop the aggression. I know we are both fed up and shes makes excuses for his behavior instead of accepting that he is a danger. She says I’m an asshole for continuing to bring it up. But I am very scared of the dog at this point and I know it’s a matter of time till I’m bit. I’m not sure whether to leave her, ask her to get rid of the dog, or continue to hope that she can get him the help he needs. 
I feel like a huge jerk to give her the ultimatum that it’s me or the dog.

TL;DR girlfriends dog is aggressive and bites people. I want her to get rid of the dog for our safety.",,,,,,,,
Boyfriend will only marry me if I relocate and share my assets and savings,"Boyfriend (39 m) of 11 months proposed to me (37 f) and then asked me to relocate with him to his country and combine all our premarital savings immediately after marriage. Our assets/incomes are more or less equal.

He also asked me to sell my current house and close out the rest of the payments on his home before I even move into it. He isn't really open to any other options like him moving, renting, changing his job or selling his own home. He also gets upset and insists I don't fully trust him if I'm hesitant to go all in immediately and buy (and own) half his home in addition to moving.

I'm willing to relocate for him and even to contribute in paying off the rest of his mortgage and expenses or rent another home until we find a place we both like and buy together, but he doesn't agree. I'm not sure what to do next, I feel like I'm negotiating a business deal and not in a loving relationship anymore and it feels off.

Am I overreacting, is he right that we should immediately combine assets and think of ""our"" future together if we are married? Should I ditch him or try to find an alternate solution? I'm worried this only gets worse after marriage builds resentment and I feel pressured into other things later.

tl;dr : Boyfriend will only marry me if I relocate to his country and share my premarital assets and savings.",,,,,,,,
Am I being unreasonable for disliking ex-gf's risque social media? How to handle in the future.,"TL;DR I'm not sure if I was unreasonable about my expectations for ex gf and social media.

I'm a 32m and I left my gf of 2 years 8 months ago because of her social media presence. It was mostly Instagram and tiktok and she wasn't doing anything that most people would consider cheating but I felt uncomfortable with it. I did know when I met her that she was very active on it but after a year in her posts got to the point where she was pretty much wearing nothing and while i was really proud of how good she looked, I also asked her if she'd be willing to save some of her body just for me. That was a firm no and we just couldn't make it work. I'm a successful, attractive guy and I thought I was respectful/reasonable.  Dating since the breakup has just been so much of the same though. I'm not dating anyone more than a 2-3 years younger and not even looking for a super specific type of look. Just someone I can laugh and have a conversation with without having to take a picture every hour and thinking about every guy that's going to be commenting on that photo. I had even told my ex that I'd love to take care of our expenses if she'd be willing to take less ""revealing"" jobs/posts or support her finding any other type of career but that was shot down too. Am I being ridiculous and backwards here? If I am what are appropriate boundaries for this kind of thing?",,,,,,,,
Messed up relationship with my parents and sibling,"tl;Dr: bad grades, bad relationship with my parents and bad relationship between parents

So...i am a 17 year old guy and my relationship with my parents and siblings is very bad

I used to be academically bright..but after COVID lockdown i was not the same...but i was studying okayish even during lockdown...once i entered 11th grade..it was online classes and i hardly understood these new teachers and my attention span became way worse..i couldn't even concentrate for 5-10 mins continuously...i was easily distracted...and i have anxiety issuesi was very good at math...i believe it was becuz my basics during 10th grade was strong..so math wasn't a problem...but i started failing in chemistry...average in physics i am now a very poor student...

So..my sibling, my sister 27 years old went thru my browsing history and discovered nfsw content and she started judging me based on that...she immediately showed that to my mom(47) and they both scolded me...they would constantly, regularly go thru my chats with anyone i have texted..

And lately i am feeling too bad about myself i think there hasn't been a single day i didn't cry for the past 2 months..atleast for 5 days in a week...i am not sure if this is depression I'm going thru...and they are talkin shit like crazy...i know they are talking like this for my own good but...due to my low attention span i wasn't able to understand like 50-60% of what's taught in class...school usually begins by 7:30 am and ends by 8pm...during Sundays..it usually begins by 8am and ends by 6pm i don't get to have any holidays.. except if there were any government holidays

My parents wasted a lot of money on my education(around $4,844.39)for these 2 years(usual school+coaching for competitive exams)

I wish I never even existed...i feel like a total useless shit...i couldn't control my tears even while typing this whole thing out

My father has been cheating on my mother for the past 30 years and we only discovered it recently...
My father never Really cared about anything...that money they spent on my for these two years is not a big deal for him...but that's no excuse for me being a worthless piece of fucking shit...

My sister would judge me with her look ....everytime i see her eyes i would just want to cry....

She would constantly yell ""he couldn't even travel to nearby town by himself in a bus how will he even get a job"" she would constantly remind me how much of an incompetent person i am...i don't have any friends (those who ACTUALLY care about me and help me out)I'm just a loser...a practical loser..

My mother is the only person who i believe actually care about me...she went thru a lot..she would often say that shes only alive to raise us and here i am...
She always knew my father was cheating on her..

I don't think my father ever cared about me at all...but deep down he does maybe...

I am not like..failing right now...i think i may get around 70% in my finally high school exam but i could have done that without all these coaching classess...i feel like i would have done better than this in high school exams...but the coaching classes are for competitive exams..and it cost too much..and i got way way worse ranks...

My sister is saying i should have told them before itself that i won't be able to get good ranks in competitive exams(for what they paid so much money)

I don't expect to get any good college...i feel ashamed..

I may have OCD and i have anxiety issues..i have to visit a therapist after exams are over..

My both math teachers..the one I had in school and the guy in coaching classes...but told me that I have great potential and intelligence but I am not using it properly to get good grades..

I just..don't know where to talk about all this...so yeah...",,,,,,,,
Should I (F26) be mad at the other woman (F25),"My bf and I have been together for 6 years. Recently he came clean and told me he kissed a girl a few months ago. They worked together. I met her at a Christmas party once and she seemed nice. I decided to confront her and she gave a an entirely different story. She claimed by bf hid his relationship status for months. Then always told her we were on/off and that I was encouraging him to pursue other women so sort out his life (untrue). That they got super drunk and kissed one night but he had told her he was on an off period with me. She confirmed multiple times and he assured her that he was not with me. When she met me she realized how nice I was and told my bf she didn’t appreciate him doing that to me. But she had no proof that we were never broken up because she hadn’t spoken to be personally about it and her and my bf were close friends and she had no reason to not trust him. She chose to ignore this mess and move on because that’s what she felt was best and because my bf had spent the last 4 months convincing her that when they had kissed he was single and she trusted him. He still continued to flirt with here these past few weeks so she got fed up and blocked him and told him to respect his relationship and leave her out of it. I understand where she’s coming from but I still think she should’ve have been involved in the first place. Am I wrong to be mad at this girl? Me and my bf are working through this because he came clean but I’m still angry at the other woman. 

TL:DR: bf kissed another girl after telling her we were on a break. I am still mad that she allowed it to happen.",,,,,,,,
my[M29] partner[M34] is too demanding,"Apologies if this is all over the place.

My partner and I have been together for about a year and half. We live together. I am becoming increasingly stressed by his behavior. I feel that my partner is very demanding and unrealistic and that I am not able to keep up with it all.
My partner blew up at me the other night because I was reading a book in the evening before bed (this is how I like to unwind) and not choosing to massage and caress him. I didn't sleep the night before this because my forearms/hands were in pain. Earlier that evening I had playfully asked him to rub my butt and he said he was exhausted and I said 'i understand' with a smile.

We've had arguments about his need for me to massage and caress him constantly. If I am in the same room he expects me to happily stop whatever I'm doing and caress and massage him for upwards of 30 minutes. If I politely say ""no, I'm tired"" he leaves the room disappointed. Same thing if I don't do it for long enough. He does not massage and caress me hardly at all. He says that touch is his love language. But he wants to BE touched, he shows little interest in touching me. 

His job causes him extreme stress. He is constantly doing educational programs to advance himself. His work causes him to have panic attacks which he has recently been prescribed Xanax for. I try my best to support him through his anxiety and emotional issues. He often takes it out on me and has even admitted it several times (and apologized). He has anxiety and signs of OCD. He will obsessively clean the house even when it is already clean. When I am home he will micromanage me just existing in the house. 

When he blew up the other night he told me that he doesn't feel taken care of by me and he is not okay with it. He's about to take an exam and he's stressed and I'm not doing enough for him. He screamed ""it's not all about you!"" Said I was ""oblivious."" 

I was pretty shocked and hurt by all this considering I am at my breaking point trying to support him and he acts so entitled and selfish at times. It's like no matter what I do it's never enough and I'm always a disappointment to him. I work 10.5-11 hour days (5 am start) and have a physical job where I work with my hands all day. My partner works from home on the computer.

I feel his definition of being ""taken care of"" is to neglect most of my personal needs and boundaries (alone time, hobbies, rest, time with friends) and care for his every need. I feel that we aren't looking for the same kind of relationship. I am looking for a partner, he is looking for a servant, therapist, and masseur. 

I love him and when it's good, it's amazing. When it's bad, it's so bad. I am just about ready to give up... I feel what he said to me the other night was emotionally abusive and crossed a line. What should I do? Couple counseling? Walk away?

Tl;dr Partner is too demanding of me. His emotional issues have started to turn abusive imo. Maybe I am a terrible boyfriend. Salvage relationship or walk away?",,,,,,,,
"BF of 5 mos [33M], best friend of 5 years, told me [27F] he's been ruminating on our ""differences"" lately. We're about to move in together. Advice about how to talk about it?"," 

Tl;dr - Boyfriend alluded to a conversation we need to have about our differences—none of which are deal breakers, according to him. I want to prepare for this conversation with why our differences make us better people.

My boyfriend, Todd, is my very best friend. Our origin story is *not* a straight line, and I don't want to bog down my question/problem with a recap now, but we've known each other for 5+ years, and started dating in Nov 2022. We are presently long distance, but these last 5 months have been the happiest of my life. And in a few weeks, I'm moving back across the US—and to him—thanks to my new job.

Todd has diagnosed anxiety, classified as ""high functioning anxiety"" by his therapist, which means he's a staunch perfectionist and puts a LOT of pressure on himself to do things not just ""right,"" but as right as possible. I likewise have anxiety, but more esteem related.

We're moving in together in a few weeks which is a stressful (and exciting!) moment for any couple. We have so much in common and align on all the same core values. We're both gaming, goofy, family-loving, career people, and we're on the same page about being in this for the long-haul.

Which is why I was blindsided last night when we were watching Netflix together (over the phone), and he signed off with a message to me on Discord about how he finds himself focusing heavily on our differences lately, and that he's been struggling to talk to me about it. He ended the DM with ""I love you and everything is ok, but not saying something is probably worse at this point.""

I was speechless (textless?). He was *not* interested in entertaining a conversation at that moment, so what more could I say than ""Thank you for telling me. Good night."" Minutes later he came back saying it was wrong of him to not give me a chance to reply. (Um, *true*.)

Despite the rising panic attack in my stomach (anxious nausea, yay), I was polite and said I was ultimately interested in listening and understanding his perspective, but clearly he wasn't ready to share. I followed it with 'When you're ready, maybe I can share how I see our differences, and we can just talk about it together.'

He's clearly catastrophizing this incoming conversation, but we left it alone until he called me this morning (when I woke up). In our call, I kept my emotions in check, but said having *nothing* to go on was making this very hard for me. Not knowing if whatever is on his mind is ""a worst case scenario"" (read: breakup worthy) situation was freaking me out. He said, ""Oh. No, it's not a 'worst case scenario.'""

Well gee, thanks for that! I do feel better now than I did all of last night, as I'm pretty sure whatever is on his mind are things we can compromise on. But sadly this conversation is on hold until after this weekend, when he'll be out of touch for his friend's bachelor party.

He's been his normally loving, comforting self to me since. (As in, not pulling back, not withholding affection, not even indicating there's much amiss at all!)

Some further background:

\- His parents have been married for 50 years in April, so long-term commitment and compatibility is critical to him. I'm certain he's modeling what he wants in a partner on them.

\- I'm the first to admit we *are* different people. Our core compatibilities, values, and goals are aligned, but I'm more artsy, emotional, and sometimes outgoing, than he who is more fitness, objective, and homebody-like. I love these differences about us—I think he fills in my blanks like I fill in his.

\- We've actually had similar conversations to this before. He thinks I'll be unsatisfied with him socially, emotionally, because I like going out every so often with friends. Meanwhile, he detests crowds and alcohol. (I'm moving from a west-coast metropolis to his metropolis suburb. But I was raised in a cow-town, for pete's sake!) I think he's dwelling on these subtle, compromise-able differences.

**Anyway, I'm rambling... And I'm in need of some advice from you lovely people about how to best talk to him about our differences, how to reassure him, and any other learnings from your stories of differences and love.** 

I know his insecurities aren't mine to cure in him, but I'm just...so in love, and so committed to building a life together that fulfills *both* of us. One that lessens the burdens and heightens the joy.

I think his HFA is convincing him we're not ""perfectly"" matched in every way (good, I say!) and thus we're doomed to fail.

Thanks for reading this far. Love you guys...",,,,,,,,
"Me (22M) and My girlfriend (23F) in a four year relationship. She fell for another guy, wants to be with me still.","First of all, this is going to be an extremely long post, so to anyone who takes the time to read this and offer anything they can, please know I will be extremely grateful.

Our history: We have been together for nearly four years now, just two months left for that. We both love each other, at least she did just some time ago. It has been a long-distance relationship in between as well, we were together for a year when we first met, by together i mean we met daily and stuff. After that, it has been spells of a few weeks together and then months of LDR. We never really faced any problems before all this happened. Now i had been preparing for my MBA for the last year or so, and i am a very aspirational person. I want to get into the creamy colleges, and I am very close. My interviews are done, i am just waiting for the results. And she is currently pursuing Public Relations and Advertising from a very good university as well, she has done well for herself.

Her problems / Point of View: Last year, on her birthday, she got a dog. She is like SERIOUSLY crazy about dogs. That puppy was her dream, she loved him more than she has loved anything or anyone else, and I was happy for her. I loved that dog too. I had never seen her that happy, and trust she was extremely happy with me before he came along. I was all the more elated. But extremely tragically the little dude died to parvovirus at a very young age, and she hasn't been the same since. She has told me after her dog died, she had really stopped caring much about anything except for me, and told me that even her will to work towards US has reduced. On top of this, She had caught Tuberculosis of the abdomen, which made her very cranky and always in pain at her stomach and the medicines had very severe affect on her health. I could tell over the last one year, I was dating a very different person but I knew ( still know ) that i am okay with it, i truly love her. Now since January, we have been arguing over the phone a lot. She had stopped listening to me, i would catch her scrolling instagram while talking to me, not really paying attention while I was only and only talking to her. I patiently tried to wait other such stuff out as well, and respectfully told her that this kinda stuff irritates me a little. It will be good if just 15-20 minutes of your day could be dedicated to me (She's extremely busy from 9 to 7, her college is like crazy hectic). Other than that, she would accuse me of being not available when she needed me. She would often say that how she needs me there with her physically, which was not possible at that moment.  She would say how i have lost my emotional side and became very ""Mechanical"". She would also tell me that our relationship was now feeling more and more like a work to do rather than something natural but she would always say in the end that she is there to work shit out and wants to be with me and expected me to understand that the death of her dog, 1 and a half years ago, still has a huge impact on her life and how she feels like a failure as she could not take care of one being who trusted her with his life, reasons which to me seemed fair and she would ask me if i had the patience till she got out of this phase of hers. She also has trouble making her friends, which made her lonely in her new place though she lived with her younger sister who goes to school there. So she told me that i am/was her only source of relaxation, peace or assurance that things will be okay.

My POV: First of all, Let me tell anyone who reads this. I love this woman. I have never felt the way I feel about her, and she at least says the same even now, althought I am 1000% sure she did before few months ago. I for four months spent my every single second of my life with her, after her dog's death just to take care of her and make sure she's okay. and I did not have to force any single action or emotion I showed at that point of time. It all came naturally to me and i have never made her count that, I am just trying to present my side here. I was the one who took her to the hospital for 13 straight days as well to get at the root cause of her issue which eventually was TB. You get the gist, i will do this shit keeping my goals and aims aside for only my family and HER. I have been extremely busy for past one year I agree. The entrance exams in my country are very tough to crack, I had to study day and night, and was always tired at the end of the day so a lot of times i could not talk to her at night when she was free. Believe me when i say i tried like hell, but there came a point when my body would naturally shut off for sleep. Because i come from a middle class household, I had to crack the exams and interviews swiftly in one go. I did not become mechanical, this phase of my life, the pressure and anxiety had taken a toll on me. I tried talking it out with her, but she was not in a space where she could offer me any comfort as she was going through shit her self. It made both of us kinda distant as we kept certain things to our selves. She still shared a lot, I didn't as mainly i did not want to give her more tension. Talking about the arguments, recently since the beginning of this year she had just stopped listening to me or anything I would want to say. I agree I shouted multiple times, atleast 4-5 times in past three months, and i regret that. One should never shout at their significant other. I have apologized to her, but she has hard time letting those arguments go even though she acknowledges it was not me alone. She says the love is lost and she wants that spark back. I have a tough time telling her that it was since her dog died that she had started drifting apart (please don't think this is selfish, this is what happened) I have never said her these words. I held on, still hold on 16 months later that. I have two herniated disks and extreme anxiety and no one was there for me as well during that period of time but i never blamed her or accused her like that.

Where everything broke down: I had recently gone to meet her as I was finally free from my exams and interviews, please note that I DID NOT HAVE MONEY TO BOOK FLIGHT TICKETS, she was the one who did that which made me think she really wants me there. Maybe she did. The day I arrived at her apartment I could see she was behaving weirdly and hiding something. Anytime I would touch her phone she would find a reason to take it away. I loved her phone's camera and was always clicking her or mine photos only, she has a pixel. I have never been the snoopy guy, she has told me multiple times this is what she really likes about me than the previous guys she's been with. So it felt weird that she did that. Now, we had went out, I had brought this beautiful dress for her long ago which she told me she will wear when I will come to meet her. She wore that dress, I was extremely tired after coming back from the date and slept as soon as I came back. I woke up around 4 a.m. to drink water and saw her phone ringing by some guy, I opened her phone and saw that she had sent her photos to that guy (in that dress where she looked extremely hot, like she is hot and pretty and way out of my league trust me) and that guy had told her I love you and shit. She had obviously said nothing to the I love yous, even telling him to stay away but as I scrolled up the chat I saw that she had flirted a lot with him, and eventually 3 weeks ago they had exchanged I love yous multiple times. I broke down crying, and she woke up and started explaining and stuff. What broke my trust was she snatched the phone and deleted the chat saying ""It will only hurt you more and I don't want that"". Then she went on saying that she loves me, wants to be with me and will stop everything with that person. But she admitted that she had gone to him out of frustration of the long distance and liked the attention he gave her. She said most of the I love yous I told him were when I was drunk and that she had never been physical with him or even hugged him and did not mean the ILYS at all, told me she had just sent those photos to him because he was asking constantly to and she liked the attention he gave her. I trust her on the physical part, because I know her that much. She said whatever she felt about him was a phase, as i was so far away and unavailable and we had started fighting a lot.

Now she's asking for time, saying that this entirely wasn't her fault. To which, I agree upto certain extent. It was the circumstances as well, but I came to understand that she never really realized I could be having my own mental health problems as well. Just because I wasn't available you'd go to some other guy to do that stuff doesn't fit right with me. The bigger question to me is, how do I trust her when she deleted that chat. I am a hopeless romantic but there's a limit to me as well. She told me she wants US to work and she's ready to do that but before that she needs time and has told me not to call her my girlfriend or treat her like that for few days or weeks and wants us to start fresh, like meeting again, going on a first date and shit, which I think might work. But again the issue of trust arises. I had always imagine after going to my MBA college it will be much easier to meet her, talk to her as at home my parents are very nosy and I am poor guy as of now who's working really hard. I was doing that in part for her as well, I wanted to travel with her, live with her and the MBA colleges I have given interviews for give really hefty paying jobs after graduation so the life we imagined was close. The time she's taking is making me really anxious, I tried to tell her that let's talk about what happened but she said she cannot as of now she doesn't have the mental space to do that. I feel like I am being tortured because, I want to be with her and she tells me the same but then continues to delay the sorting process since 6 days now. I am giving her space, infact she's the one texting or video calling me most of the times since I came back. The fact that I believe some of what she says is that since I was there, we had a lot of sex, she was physically very open to me like she usually is and I trust my instincts enough to know that she hasn't physically been with someone else.

For atleast 20 more months we will have to do LDR. Trust will remain an issue for me and I think only she can address it. I feel desperate as fuck waiting for her, but it is a relationship of four years with me still loving her and she saying that she still obviously is attracted to me and has feelings for me but isn't sure if it's love. She says she's seen people fall out of love and then back and believes that will happen to us as well. But the wait is killing me, I am scared if I push her to sort or talk things out right now or soon, things will snap again. I am giving her space and time but it is kind of a torture to me, because in utterly simple words, I love this woman, I would've died for her no questions asked. I have done shit for her I would have never done for anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Is going ahead or waiting for her a good idea? Can the trust and spark be restored?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Girlfriend not in good mental space, I was extremely busy with my MBA prep. She felt lonely and ignored. Started flirting and sharing photos with another guy, did that for a month and did not bother to tell me about it. I found out accidentally. She says she wants to be with me even still. I am okay with that, but the wait she's taking to sort things out is killing me.",,,,,,,,
"BF of 5 mos [33M], best friend of 5 years, told me [27F] he's been ruminating on our ""differences"" lately. We're about to move in together. Stories of partners who are happy and different?","Tl;dr - Boyfriend alluded to a conversation we need to have about our differences—none of which are deal breakers, according to him. I want to prepare for this conversation with why our differences make us better people. 

My boyfriend, Todd, is my very best friend. Our origin story is *not* a straight line, and I don't want to bog down my question/problem with a recap now, but we've known each other for 5+ years, and started dating in Nov 2022. We are presently long distance, but these last 5 months have been the happiest of my life. And in a few weeks, I'm moving back across the US—and to him—thanks to my new job.

Todd has diagnosed anxiety, classified as ""high functioning anxiety"" by his therapist, which means he's a staunch perfectionist and puts a LOT of pressure on himself to do things not just ""right,"" but as right as possible. I likewise have anxiety, but more esteem related. 

We're moving in together in a few weeks which is a stressful (and exciting!) moment for any couple. We have so much in common and align on all the same core values. We're both gaming, goofy, family-loving, career people, and we're on the same page about being in this for the long-haul.

Which is why I was blindsided last night when we were watching Netflix together (over the phone), and he signed off with a message to me on Discord about how he finds himself focusing heavily on our differences lately, and that he's been struggling to talk to me about it. He ended the DM with ""I love you and everything is ok, but not saying something is probably worse at this point.""

I was speechless (textless?). He was *not* interested in entertaining a conversation at that moment, so what more could I say than ""Thank you for telling me. Good night."" Minutes later he came back saying it was wrong of him to not give me a chance to reply. (Um, *true*.)

Despite the rising panic attack in my stomach (anxious nausea, yay), I was polite and said I was ultimately interested in listening and understanding his perspective, but clearly he wasn't ready to share. I followed it with 'When you're ready, maybe I can share how I see our differences, and we can just talk about it together.'

He's clearly catastrophizing this incoming conversation, but we left it alone until he called me this morning (when I woke up). In our call, I kept my emotions in check, but said having *nothing* to go on was making this very hard for me. Not knowing if whatever is on his mind is ""a worst case scenario"" (read: breakup worthy) situation was freaking me out. He said, ""Oh. No, it's not a 'worst case scenario.'""   

Well gee, thanks for that! I do feel better now than I did all of last night, as I'm pretty sure whatever is on his mind are things we can compromise on. But sadly this conversation is on hold until after this weekend, when he'll be out of touch for his friend's bachelor party. 

He's been his normally loving, comforting self to me since. (As in, not pulling back, not withholding affection, not even indicating there's much amiss at all!)

Some further background:

\- His parents have been married for 50 years in April, so long-term commitment and compatibility is critical to him. I'm certain he's modeling what he wants in a partner on them.

\- I'm the first to admit we *are* different people. Our core compatibilities, values, and goals are aligned, but I'm more artsy, emotional, and sometimes outgoing, than he who is more fitness, objective, and homebody-like. I love these differences about us—I think he fills in my blanks like I fill in his. 

\- We've actually had similar conversations to this before. He thinks I'll be unsatisfied with him socially, emotionally, because I like going out every so often with friends. Meanwhile, he detests crowds and alcohol. (I'm moving from a west-coast metropolis to his metropolis suburb. But I was raised in a cow-town, for pete's sake!) I think he's dwelling on these subtle, compromise-able differences. 

Anyway, I'm rambling... And I'm in need of some reassurance from you lovely people about your stories of differences and love. I know his insecurities aren't mine to cure in him, but I'm just...so in love, and so committed to building a life together that fulfills *both* of us. One that lessens the burdens and heightens the joy. 

I think his HFA is convincing him we're not ""perfectly"" matched in every way (good, I say!) and thus we're doomed to fail.

Thanks for reading this far. Love you guys...",,,,,,,,
Staying friends after the relationship ends... right away?," Long story short, I met a girl. We dated for about 6 months(known each other for 7), and it was amazing. We both got feelings for each other. She is giving me every signal that she wants me to be her boyfriend. We talk every day, hang out constantly, and have sex things are great. So things are getting serious, I want this girl in my life I'm going to ask her out. about a week prior to me doing so there was a big 360 in her energy toward me. She was going through some things and after talking that's what I thought it was. Well, the moment she realized it was getting serious it turns out she realized she was not ready for a relationship. I asked her out, and she said she wants me to be her boyfriend, she is sure about me but she just needs time.

A month passes, and her energy is off. She doesn't talk to me the same. It's different. When I asked her what I was to her she said I was a friend with benefits. I did not like that, I did not see her like that. Even though there was no ""label"" we were in a relationship. We developed feelings for each other and cared for each other. Things continued like this we talked and we decided to actually just be friends yesterday. She felt like I was her boyfriend and that's not what she wanted.... even though that's what she wanted in the beginning. Until she developed real feelings for me which made her put her walls up. Does this make sense to me? No. Things were literally 100% amazing. Like actually, no red flags, tried to look past the rose-colored glasses, and nothing. We want the same things out of life, have the same interests, and share the same viewpoints on deep important things that usually are breaking points in a relationship. We have a genuine connection, are attracted to each other could literally talk for hours and just have a good time with each other. It literally went from perfect let's do this, to I don't want a relationship. I don't get it.

I respect that. I don't want to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't want to be with me. It's a pretty basic requirement in my book. It sucks, and it hurts but it is what it is. I want her for her but somehow, even if it was mutual at first, it is not now. I want to be friends with her because I genuinely care for her and enjoy her company. So yes we decide to be nothing more than friends. No benefits, actually just friends.

This was last night. She wants to hang out today..... it hasn't even been a day.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR;**

Dated a girl for 6 months. When I asked her out she said she is not ready for a relationship, we continue the ... situationship for a month. Her energy changed, feels like I'm her boyfriend and she doesn't want that. We decide to just be friends. If I had it my way we'd be together but I care for her and want her. Let's just be friends then. That was yesterday, she wants to hang out today...",,,,,,,,
My bf is constantly getting upset with me for not answering calls,"My (25f) boyfriend (26m) and I are constantly having the same fight about me not answering a phone call. My boyfriend calls me multiple times a day at random times, during the work day, during the evening, even at night time. And if I don't pick up, he gets upset. I always apologize and explain what I was doing but he gets so mad. He says the only thing he asks of me is to answer the phone but I can't help if I was busy at the moment he called. He never texts and asks me if I'm busy or out somewhere. And he doesn't understand why I can't pick up if I'm watching a show or movie with my roommates (it's rude to ask to pause with multiple people for a 3 minute conversation). One of our biggest fights, which he still brings up almost 3 years later, is when I didn't answer while watching a show. There were 5 minutes left of the episode and I asked if I could call him back when it finished because I knew we would be on the phone for maybe 20 minutes. He got so angry that he didn't speak to me until 3pm the next day. What do I do?

tl;dr: my bf calls me constantly and gets really angry when I don't answer even if I'm busy.",,,,,,,,
(20F) reconnecting with ex fwb (30M) positive or negative?,"
It’s been 4 months since I cut him off. I was upset when he referred me to his cousin( gussed he got bored of me, we’ve seen each other 3 times a week for about 4weeks)  and said he ain’t got no time.  Then I cut him off since I know I was catching feelings for this guy. 

We did have a good time and I wanna reconnect with him again as I want something casual at the moment but I have no balls to reconnect with him. 

TLDR: Would it be positive to try or has anyone ever reconnected with their causal partners?  Thanks!",,,,,,,,

Why am I thinking about my ex so much now when I wasn't a month ago?,"It's been 7 months since my ex (25F) and I (26M) broke up. The lady time we directly spoke to each other was in the beginning of January. Lately though  I've been thinking about her a lot and at random times catch myself thinking about her. Sometimes it's because I miss her and sometimes it's because I have a new thought process about why we ended or how things could've gone differently. I texted her last week telling her I missed her and wanted her back after a dream I woke up from that honestly felt like real life. Afterwards I texted again thanking her for not answering and that I would try my best not to bother her again. She texted me back saying that the time apart was good for her, that she didn't want to pursue a relationship with me anymore, and that u should move on. A large part of me wants to and is ready to move on but a piece of me still wants to hold out and wait for her. A friend told me that I could wait for her and still pursue other people and things. But I wonder if that's the best course of action. Is there any advice anyone can give me?

Ex and I broke up several months ago, I've been thinking about her more lately than I have in previous months. Want to move on but also hold out and wait. Advice?",,,,,,,,

"Boyfriend (M26) does not want my best friend back in my life, but I (F23) do.","I’m going to make this quick, short, and simple. My boyfriend (M26) and I (F23) will be together for a year in May. We have an AMAZING relationship. He is great to me and we have so much fun together. I love him very much and nothing would ever change that. So, here’s the story:

We met each other through friends. My best friend, (who keep in mind, has been my best friend for seven or eight years) WAS dating my boyfriend’s friend. They broke up before my boyfriend and I even got together. We ended up hanging out with them at the club, which was the night I met my boyfriend. We hooked up that night and then began dating a month later. My best friend was upset when we started dating, which is understandable because it was her ex’s friend. Basically, the situation got out of hand and she was afraid he was taking me away from her and she was saying bad things about him and even tried to tell me he was engaged, which wasn’t true by the way. She just wanted to push me away from him because she wanted me to herself. We got into several fights over this and I hated having to choose between my boyfriend and my best friend, which I never wanted to do in the first place. Then there was one night that she began going off on me over text, and she was drunk at the time. She did apologize for it, but I was starting to get sick of the drama. We stopped talking after this completely. 

Months and months go by; she’s asked me to hangout several times and a part of me got very nervous about doing so because I didn’t want to go through that again; all the fights and all the drama. She even apologized several times over everything she did and said she wants to make it up to my boyfriend and tell him how sorry she is and wants to try and be civil. But, I declined. At this point, my boyfriend “hates” my ex best friend and holds a very big grudge towards her. Another thing to keep in mind, my best friend and I used to fight all the time and would go months without talking, it’s just what we did. So this was kind of normal for us. We fought over stupid things too, just bickered a bit, nothing crazy. You know how girls can be. 

I’ll be honest, I missed her like crazy. NO ONE compared to my friendship with her. She was my best friend, we did everything together. She listened to me and looked out for me, and I did the same for her. I had friends after her and most of them are SO self absorbed besides one of them who I am close with. My ex best friend and I were civil at this point, just not hanging out. She offered to do my hair because she works in a salon and did my hair for years before all of this happened. I said yes and JUST got my hair done with her yesterday. So, of course we are talking and catching up and telling each other how much we missed one another. I was even scared to tell my boyfriend I was getting my hair done by her, because he has this HUGE hatred towards her. 

He did know I was getting it done by her and he is so afraid we were going to start talking and be friends again. Well of course, when I saw her yesterday all the memories came back and I missed her like crazy. We are both crazy, so once we see each other we just click again so quickly. She just moved out and wants me to see her apartment. She wants to plan for me and my other best friend to see her apartment next Friday and get dinner and drinks. It felt extremely refreshing to slowly gain a friendship with her again. She said how sorry she is about everything that happened and once again, wants to make amends with my boyfriend and wants everything to be okay, because we were always inseparable. 

When I got home from getting my hair done, my boyfriend and I ate dinner and we were having a good night. He saw a couple texts from her on my phone and immediately goes, “I knew this was going to happen.” I got upset and told him that we aren’t best friends, but we are texting and starting up a friendship again. He was so pissed about it. He told me he loves how things are going and he doesn’t want her to “ruin” it, WHICH SHE WON’T! I would NEVER let that happen. She knows I’m in a serious relationship and just wants me back in her life, and I feel the same way. She doesn’t expect anything crazy from me, just a couple hangouts once in a while, which I don’t see that as a bad thing? 

His feelings about the situation are valid, and I understand why he is nervous about me being friends with her again, but I wish he can just accept it. I haven’t told him she invited me to see her new place next week because I have a feeling he will freak out! I see him every single day and I love seeing him, but I just want him to be able to accept that she is in my life again. It shouldn’t have to be this big of a deal. He has friends I don’t like at all, but I don’t care if he hangs out with them.

Also, my boyfriend is AMAZING. We have a great connection and SO much fun together. I love him with all my heart and would never let anything come between him and I. 

TL;DR
Boyfriend doesn’t want my ex best friend back in my life because he doesn’t like her, but I do want her back in my life. 

Please give me honest opinions and advice on what I should do.",,,,,,,,
How do you cope with the anxiety of your s/o having surgery?,"My girlfriend is having surgery today for her hip. She's had a similar surgery before and she's not nervous. We texted for a bit before she went under, but then I had to go because I had to drive. I know she'll likely be fine, but I can't help but feel anxious about her getting surgery. How do you cope with this anxiety? She's having 2 more surgeries this summer, so I'll have to deal with this anxiety again.

Update: my parents don’t approve of my relationship.,"Update: My Parents Don’t Approve of My Relationship.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11fr2ql/my_mother_is_trying_to_set_me_up_with_someone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Update: My (23f) Parents (51F and 56 M) Tried Setting Me Up With Someone Else

Here’s the update, so a couple months back I posted saying my parents don’t approve of my current relationship with a man that has a child. He’s also has darker skin. We have been together for 6 months. 

A couple weeks ago I had the ultimate blow up with my mom. I’ll be honest, I lost it. I was swearing and crying. Told my mom I was leaving and she can’t stop me from doing so. So I told them to back off and it’s my life, packed up my stuff, and I left. I moved in with my grandmother until I figure something out with a rental; I started working again instead of devoting my life to my parents. I feel happier, I haven’t thought of any of the deep dark thoughts that used to cross my mind, and all in all my mental health has improved substantially in just a couple short weeks. My relationship with my boyfriend (28M) has improved drastically (we used to get into some kind of argument involving my parents quite often and now we don’t really have any major disagreements on anything). In all, I feel way better in a lot of ways. My mom and dad still try to reach out with kind words, which I’ll be honest I wish they would’ve done this a lot sooner. I didn’t need to be pushed out the door because of my relationship, I didn’t need to lose it like how I did if they had just accepted it and moved on. Maybe if they would’ve gave him a better chance than they did this whole freak out would have never happened. 

What made me snap was the talking behind my back. My parents were telling my friends how I could do better, how I shouldn’t tie myself down. The thing is that my boyfriend has a good paying job, he takes good care of his son, and he treats me so well. He makes sure I’m taken care of and I knew how it was breaking his heart that my parents refused to see that. They just labelled him as trash and moved on. The thing that was my final straw was when one of my parents told a friend of mine that they need to hang out with me more to “keep me away from that trash”. Then shortly after him and I went fb official, well we already were but shared the status. My parents flipped, said they had to talk to me and tried to push more work onto me because “if I had enough time to share on Facebook I had enough time to do more work”. I got home after helping a relative, I was exhausted, and just plain old mad as well as upset. So I started my car and packed my bags. By the time I was taking the last of my things out one of my parents came into the kitchen. That’s when I lost it. I said they call him all these rude things when he has done nothing to them. He’s come out for free multiple times to help out. He still offers to help out even after knowing all the things they have called him. He doesn’t even hate them for the things they’ve called him. He just wants a chance to prove himself as a good man for me. But they won’t even allow him on the property. I screamed about how upset I was over the treatment I have gotten since I moved home, all the work and effort I have put in, how I keep my mouth shut to keep the peace because they already have too much on their plate. It hurt me, I’m still hurt, still can’t believe I finally said something. I wish I could’ve held it in, or I could’ve fallen for someone who they’d approve of. But I couldn’t. I can’t picture my life without this man, he treats me in the ways I had always wanted to be treated and has shown me what unconditional love is. I couldn’t give it up and I couldn’t give him up for my parents. There were a few times I wondered if I should split from him to keep the peace and keep my family but it brought me to tears every time just thinking I’d never have him in my life again. A part of me still wishes I could’ve been what they always wanted me to be. But I couldn’t be unfair to myself. 


A part of me feels guilty for leaving, I know they still could’ve used my help. And really they’re my parents, I have loved them so much for so long unconditionally. I could never hate them. It broke my heart to freak like I did on them, it made me feel like I was the crazy one and I should’ve held my tongue a bit longer. But I couldn’t. I tried the calm sit down conversations, I tried to get them to listen without losing it. I still feel hurt, but I feel way happier than I do hurt and I think that is where the guilt is coming from. I feel guilty for being happy with my life. Because I know it bothered them and still does that I am in the relationship that I am in. I wish it could’ve been different, I wish they would’ve given him the chance him and I both wanted. But that isn’t what happened so I am trying to move on. 

Did I make the right decision? I feel free but at what cost. 

TLDR: I have moved out. A part of me feels guilty for leaving but I feel so free. I’m happier and my mental health has improved substantially but I still feel guilt for choosing myself.",,,,,,,,
Don’t think me and the girl I’m seeing will end up long term,"I’m 26M she’s 24 and honestly I’m a bit worried about it. 

If I was 19 then I don’t think it would be such a big issue. It would be likely that we wouldn’t be together anyway. But as I’m 26 I feel a little differently now. 

I don’t have anyone else to date and I enjoy seeing her. I’m not probably in a position where I could tell someone I’ll commit long term anyway as I don’t know where I want to settle long term yet. She also doesn’t know what she wants long term and isn’t sure she has time for anything serious. But it feels a bit weird to me. 

I don’t really know how to proceed with this. Sometimes I feel I need to break it off as I’m worried it won’t go anywhere. But then, we’re not together anyway. Just seeing eachother.  

Not sure what to do here?

(23M) BF’s sister made him sound threatening to their parents,"I (22F) went on a cruise this past week with my boyfriend’s family. i’ve hung out with them and seen them a lot before this trip. i’ve had a pretty decent relationship with his sister (21F) and felt like i could confide in her, especially since i don’t have many friends and no siblings. the truth is everyone deals with something. and sometimes when my boyfriend gets mad he can be a bit explosive. but he’s never put his hands on me or been physically abusive. the second night of the cruise we were arguing and he punched the wall in the shower. of course i felt a little uneasy after but he calmed down, took a nap, and we had a good rest of the night. Maintenance patched it while we were gone the next day. the next night i went drinking with his sister and we both got so drunk, and she said she notices he doesn’t talk to me the best sometimes. and touched on his slight anger issues/ their sibling fights. i ended up telling her what happened but asked her not to tell anyone. his sister and i ended up passing out on the pool deck and waking up at 4am. we were walking back to our separate rooms and i saw my boyfriend walking around looking for us. i was drunk and knew i shouldn’t have been out that late, so i panicked and ran around the corner even though he already saw me. i told her i was scared, but i didn’t mean it in a “he’s going to beat me” kind of way. he confronted us and when i told him we fell asleep he said i was lying and walked away. she told me to come in her room and i did for a little to avoid an argument with him. 

Now that we’re all back home, my boyfriend calls me today telling me his sister told their parents “his gf is scared of him” and probably insinuated other things. i know she was over dramatic because that’s how she is. now they’re worried about him being with me. i need advice on this situation because obviously i shouldn’t have trusted her, and now i’m wondering if my BF and i need to sit down with his parents and clear the air? should we even continue this relationship at this point? now it feels hopeless and they probably view my BF and i some way. help is appreciated.

TL;DR sister told bf’s parents i’m “scared of him” and now they’re bringing it up to him and worried",,,,,,,,
My [24F] boyfriend [26M] doesn't help out in the home although I keep asking him to because I'm so overwhelmed and burnt out.,"I'm going to try to make this short and quick. My [24F] boyfriend [26M] doesn't help out in the home although I keep asking him to because I'm so overwhelmed. I do ALL household chores (sweep, mop, laundry, dishes, mow lawn, cook, take care of the pets). I do these chores regardless if I have a job or not, with no help! I recently quit my job about a month ago and I've been voicing that I need his help and am overwhelmed, but nothing changes. He owns his own company so he works about 3-4 days a week in a physically demanding job (construction) and when he has days off he never helps. He pays rent($400) and ""spoils"" me here and there. He also fixes any issues that might arise such as my car needing work done or the house having a plumbing issues. He says that him fixing things once in a while is equal to me cleaning everyday. The issue is that he thinks he can just give me money and not help at home. I don't even take his cash I just tell him that I don't need his money, I need his help at home. I use to cook 2/3 times a day but I've gotten so burnt out because he expects a big meal since he works outside in a physically demanding job, so we've been going out to eat for dinner about 5x a week. 

This morning I blew up because we went grocery shopping and I asked him to put up the groceries since I was out taking my brother to football practice, and all he did was throw all the groceries in the fridge and stacked everything in there and made a mess. We don't have kids together, and have been living together for the 3 years we've been dating. 

It just seems like he makes my life more difficult. It feels like I already do everything on my own, rather than being able to rely on my ""partner"". I'm reaching out to reddit to get different perspectives. 

TLDR;  have been doing all house chores regardless of employment status. Boyfriend doesn't help around the house even if he's off work.",,,,,,,,
I'm ashamed to say I (29F) am tempted to break up my friends(30F) marriage to her husband (30M),"Me and this girl met when we were about 24, we worked together, lived on site and really connected. I knew her current boyfriend was her high-school sweetheart they'd been together 7 yrs at the time. I told her all about how I felt before we parted ways, but I'm not a homewrecker. I just believed she was trapped in that relationship. Nothing ever happened and we have kept in touch occasionally. They got married 2 yrs ago and I remember seeing that and my heartbreaking. Now(we haven't seen each other in 5 years) out of the blue she asks if I'll visit her. I went for the weekend with the intent of answering what seemed a call for help, not to split them up. I was nice to her husband and not falsely, he's a nice enough guy. But I can't help it, I'm still in love with her. This post is half cathartic confession but here's my question: Why would a married woman contact another woman she knows had feelings for her in the past? Is this her being careless about the awkward situation or is it an intentional obstacle she wanted to bring up? I must ask because the variable of being gay brings confusion. If I was a dude that used to love her I can't imagine being invited to their house for the weekend. I don't relish being able to fly below hetero radar BTW, but I made use of that double standard to make a friend happy with a visit.

TL;DR I think ""the one that got away"" wants to leave her husband to be with me, another woman. What, if anything, should I do?",,,,,,,,
I (35m) kinda hate the way my wife (35f) treats her employees. Do I tell her?," My wife and I both work from home on most days. We're in separate rooms, but I overhear her conversations. Thin walls.

&amp;#x200B;

She's  a manager, with about 8 direct reports in several countries. She's been  in this role for a couple years. It was a big shift when she started,  but it turns out that she really likes managing. I kinda worry that she  likes the wrong things about it.

&amp;#x200B;

She  fired somebody very soon after she took the job, and has let some other  people go since. She's been trying to fire an (admittedly, kinda bad)  employee for a few months, but is disappointed to learn that the  employee is protected by the laws of their country. Generally, it feels  like my wife is really quick with the axe. I find that disappointing,  especially since she knows firsthand what it's like to be fired. I've  held her during times when she's been fired, and it breaks her heart.

&amp;#x200B;

But the most troubling behavior came this week:

&amp;#x200B;

This  week, my wife discovered that a recently-hired employee scheduled  nearly a month off, starting for next week, and didn't notify their  manager. That's bad, obviously! So my wife called them up, and on their  call, it became clear that this employee is struggling with multiple  issues. They don't get along with their coworkers in-country, and one of  their family members is not long for this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I  think a tactful approach would have acknowledged the employee's  mistake,  recognized that it was rooted in understandable problems, and  come up with a remedy.  But that's not what my wife did, by  a long  shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, she *berated* this employee, over **2 days**  of calls, both of which made the employee cry. She lit into the  employee and told them that ""I can help you but you need to trust me!""  (Side note: In some sad way it's actually kinda funny to hear someone  angrily demand trust, as if that's how that works. It is not.)

&amp;#x200B;

At  one point, by way of anecdote, she tried to tell the employee about a  time that she helped another employee who was having problems (good!),  but in doing so, I think she disclosed private information about the  other employee's personal and professional life, which seems... bad. And  at another point, she said to the employee, ""So this is probably the  last trip you'll get to take with X, huh?"" which just seems like a  horribly tactless thing for a manager to say to an employee, even if  they're trying to do it from a good place.

&amp;#x200B;

And  throughout both conversations, she kept suggesting that the employee  think long and hard about whether they want to be at this company,  basically encouraging them to quit. That just felt horrible to me. From  what I can tell, this person *wants* to do a good job. But my wife is acting like they're some kind of deceitful layabout trying to pull one over on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I  think my concerns here are valid, but I have absolutely no idea if/how I  should raise them with my wife, and how I could do so respectfully.  I've brought up work things with her once before, in 2021, and we got  into a huge fight about it. Since then, I've just pretended not to hear  anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Help me reddit: what do I do?

TL;DR:

My wife kinda likes to fire people and is being mean to an employee. I don't know how to tell her, or if I should.",,,,,,,,
splitting bills with my(30m) relatives/housemates (27m),"Me(30m) and my wife(28f) have a house and my brother 
(27m) and his wife(26m) and another cousin(24m) live with us in their own rooms. So 5 people in total.
We share the rest of the space. Living room, dining, etc. We do have a bigger room with attached bathroom while the rest of them share bathroom.
We take care of the mortgage which is like 3000 a month. We are trying to find a good solution of splitting bills with all of them. Currently they pay like 500 a month per person and all the cost of utilities are included in that price. Would it be a fair solution to all to split the cost of the utilities as well along with the flat base price. We feel a bit odd to ask since they are relatives and we don't want to sound like landlords.
Any suggestions?

Me (M35) and a good friend of mine (M32). Do everything have to be distinguished from each other?,"  TL;DR!   
I have a friend. I go to dinner with him every time. He insisted on the AA system. It doesn't matter. I think this is reasonable.

Once he bought an ice cream. I obviously didn't have any money with me. He told me directly the next day. You didn't pay me for the ice cream yesterday.

All right. I can bear it. Until one time. There is a bag of potato chips on his desk. I grabbed two potato chips and ate them. He saw it. Since he wants me to give half of the price to him. Oh my god. This is a great friend. I can't figure it out.

Why do you have to give money? Is it okay if it's my turn to treat you to dinner next time?",,,,,,,,
I (19F) can’t orgasm with my boyfriend (18M) who I’ve been dating for 4 years and I’m sexually attracted to someone else (23M) big time. Should I suggest an open relationship?,"I (19F) love my boyfriend deeply (18M). We started off as high school best friends to sweethearts, but now we study at universities in two different countries, so we’re doing long distance. For the context, it’s going well: we get to see each other quite often, once a month, we facetime a lot, I wouldn’t say I miss him a lot. I am happy without him and I am even happier with him. We’ve been through so much together and I can’t stress this enough. We’re both born and raised in Ukraine and we fled the country together, he lived with me, my mom and two brothers in one room in a refugee shelter for half a year too. Yes, that also affected our relationship in a way that at some point we felt like we were siblings, we didn’t have a chance to have sex while being there that often and the overall vibe was leading to that. Before and after that I never orgasmed with him, but it’s not like I don’t like sex with him. I do, it’s just that I wouldn’t say it is extraordinary. It’s fine, it’s nice, it feels pleasurable.

Now, a year ago, when I was 18, right after our 4th relationship anniversary and before the war started, my two female best friends got me a trip to Egypt as my birthday present. It was one of the happiest weeks of my life. I met an English guy (22M) there and we clicked. It felt like I’ve known him for years, he wrote me 2 poems, we spent so much time together just being lost in conversation for hours. Disclaimer: I told him right away I had a boyfriend and nothing physical happened between us, although he kissed me on the top of my head and brushed my thigh with his finger once, so like some subtle touching but super respectful and never crossing the line, he literally said he wouldn’t do anything I wouldn’t wanted to me. But most importantly, because of him I realised I have a massive praise/daddy kink. He called me a good girl randomly once (he knew what he was doing but tbh I was quite naive) and my brain short circuited. I was never the same again. Man altered my brain chemistry with his British accent, charisma, gentleman manners and teasing. He also gave me his ring and we developed quite a strong emotional connection, he even gave me his ring before I left and I still carry it even though it’s been a year. Anyways when I went home the war started and he would talk to me on the phone until the mornings, comfort me, I’d fall asleep to his voice. And sometimes he turned out chat into a sexual direction. Once he sent me some raunchy voice messages saying how he “thoroughly enjoys turning me on and making me crave him”, he described some of very explicit dreams that he had with me, where he referred to “fucking my pretty face”. I never stopped him or was against that, but never directly engaged in these conversations, they would surprise freeze me but oh dear God how I enjoyed him saying that. P.S. I do feel guilty for that, my bf doesn’t know that.

I have never felt that intense craving for someone. Whenever that guy was around me I would shiver and get so fucking wet and he never even touched me. That was when I realised I’m into dirty talk too. At first it was very hard for me to get turned on to my boyfriend after that trip. Then I started picturing that guy during our sex but always felt guilt so couldn’t relax. Then I started embracing the fact that I am attracted to him and it kinda faded away (it’s been a looong time guys, more than a year now).

The thing is, no matter how much I try to enjoy sex with my boyfriend and maybe I am even quite satisfied with him in the moment of doing that, I can’t stop thinking about how that other guy made me feel. He made me feel so sexy and I am for some reason convinced that he would make me cum easily (maybe I’m wrong idk). I really want to try an open relationship with my boyfriend and have sex with that guy because the desire has been killing me for a year now, but I don’t know how to explain that to my boyfriend. First, I already talked about my orgasm with him and I know he cares about me too, but he’s not into dirty talk and honestly dirty talk would sound weird in Ukrainian and he couldn’t do it in English, we discussed that. Also I wanna be a submissive good girl, we touched upon that too but I don’t think that’s what he wants, he says that our sex is already perfect to him. He used to say he wants to tie me up and shit but never initiated that. And my last concern is that he knew about the guy, that I had a crush on him during my vacation and we almost broke up because of that but decided to keep working on our relationship. We agreed that I had a crush because something in our relationship back then was off and I sought that in others. Yeah, that’s pretty much it. If you’ve read all that — you’re my hero tbh. Please let me know all your thoughts on this and what should I do.

TL;DR I (19F) can’t orgasm with my boyfriend (18M) who I’ve been dating for 4 years and I’m sexually attracted to someone else (23M) who I met on a holiday big time, even though it’s been more than a year. My boyfriend doesn’t share what I truly need from sex to be satisfied. Should I suggest an open relationship?",,,,,,,,
Does his G/F deserve to know she was cheated on?,"**TLDR:** Had a passionate holiday romance with someone I later found out had a girlfriend. Does she deserve to know?

I (35F) met a guy (36M) I thought was amazing whilst on holiday recently and we had a whirlwind passionate romance lasting 3+ weeks. We both live in separate countries, and so deep down I knew it was likely to just be short lived. Nevertheless, we had this ridiculous connection and chemistry and so I got the feels a bit. On our last night together I asked him about staying in touch and he was like ""no, it's not realistic with the distance"". He had previously told me he had been single for many years but was happy, but mentioned in passing a girl who popped up every six months and who he went on some dates with.

At the time I was a bit sad that he didn't want to stay in touch. Whilst the distance thing is valid, I felt like our life situations are such that we could have stayed in touch had we wanted to, and so it was more likely that he just didn't like me enough to want to stay in touch. He sent me a bunch of messages once we were both home but eventually he stopped making first contact so much, and then I decided it was time to move on and I did my best to put it behind me, stopping contacting him etc.

But I've now learned through mutual acquaintances that this ""once every six months girl"" is actually a long term girlfriend he's been with for years who is away a lot because she's recently started studying. In some respects it was good to know he didn't reject me for me, but because he actually had another relationship that he didn't let on about. But I also feel annoyed he lied to / misled me. I also feel for this girl. I'm not 100% certain, but pretty sure for various reasons that they don't have any kind of open relationship or ENM situation.

Deep down I am pretty sure the best option is to say nothing to her. It's not my place. Just because I'm annoyed by being lied to/ misled doesn't mean she should be hurt. What happens on holiday stays on holiday etc etc. But I'm looking for advice. If you were the girl, would you want to know?

My [23F] best friend [23M] has been a little distant and I'm not sure if I should bring it up.,"I've known him for a year now and in the beginning of our friendship we used to talk all the time but lately it's been less since he's very depressed and going through some changes such as finding a job and all that.

Which I get and I haven't been pressuring him or anything. I voiced my concerns and he did make an effort but he's been having issues with his medication and bad ADHD and addiction so for the last week, he hasn't been texting me as often. He does apologize for it and tries to keep me updated which is why I was fine with it.

However he told me he feels very bad, is tired, doesn't get out of bed and so on. And yesterday when I called him he told me he can't talk because he's about to play a game with someone.

I told him no problem we can just do it tomorrow. He agreed and said he will if he's not playing with this one girl who he sort of has a crush on.

I feel like all this time I've been worried about him and yet he's been making plans with other people. It makes me feel less important and that my company isn't that much of a priority.

Or am I overreacting? 

TL; DR: Best friend has been less responsive and says he feels bad yet he's made plans with other people.",,,,,,,,
my abusive boyfriend cheated on me,"i’m f21, he’s m24! tl;dr

i was laying in bed yesterday and he left his phone open to go to the bathroom so i took my chance and went thru his phone bc he always does that to me and finds stuff i did in the PAST, before i even knew him. and guess what i found??? we’ve been together since november last year and i found a message from a girl in february saying ‘i’ve been thinking and i don’t wanna do this anymore it’s a bit much for me, i wanna be free.. you keep saying i can’t meet other guys and i wanna do that.. sorry’

so obviously i got mad and went off on him saying ‘lmao yk what’s so funny? the fact that you’re so fucking double standard and then i started saying how i wanna leave him bc this was finally the last straw for me!
so he started defending himself saying that it’s nothing and that he did nothing wrong and how he used to sleep w and have a thing with her way before him and i started dating like okay?? why r u still talking to her and if it’s ‘nothing’ then why the fuck did she text you this in FEBRUARY???

it’s so weird to me that he gets mad at me for doing stuff way before i knew him but it’s stupid when i get mad after seeing this? 

and a few months ago i saw him snapping this girl so i mentioned it back then asking who she was and he said that she’s ‘just a costumer’ bc he’s also a plug, and so yesterday i noticed that he changed her name to ‘oscar’ like? you say ur not gulity of anything but you changed her name?

we started fighting ab it and he was like ‘i had to change her name otherwise you’d question it again’ like yeah? obviously? and then he was like ‘i would understand if you left me for something bigger, if i actually did cheat but i haven’t done anything so you’re leaving for the smallest reason’ he thinks i’m stupid honestly

he’s done so much to me and i’m so dumb for not leaving before, i told him that i should’ve left the first time he laid his hands on me. then he started crying and was like ‘you can’t leave me, no no no i won’t ever lose you, i’m so in love with you’ stfu honestly, i explained to him that that’s not his choice but he doesn’t get it and thinks he has a say in it.

and then after awhile i was tryna sleep and he tried to have sex w me and i told him no, i don’t want to but he was like yeah come on baby i know you want to, i literally held my hand over my v to stop him and he still started fingering me despite me saying no and then he started having sex w me, despite me saying i don’t want to! and then he was like ‘it’s like i’m having sex with a doll’ so i said ‘maybe bc you are’ i’m so disgusted help!

and then this morning i kept telling him i don’t want anything to do w him and that it is over but he just won’t accept it bc ‘he’s so in love with me’ and then he started crying so i had to comfort him saying that it’s okay otherwise he couldn’t go to work today bc i ‘made him so sad and stressed’ but i truly am done so i’m gonna pack all his shit and actually stand my ground this time, i don’t deserve this

we’re both at work now and he keeps texting me like nothing ever happened",,,,,,,,
Her actions are so confusing. Am i at fault here?,"Me (25M) and my friend (25F) started hooking
up back in October and had a 4 month FWB until she ghosted me for a few weeks last month. She ghosted me for a few weeks and then hit me up one other time which i didn’t respond too. So we’ve had no communication basically for a month.

Last week i see her at the bar for the first time in a month and i still said hi and was an adult about the situation. She starts talking to me and we were both drunk and had the talk about why she ghosted me and she could have just been straight up with me.

She apologized and i forgave her bc we’ve been friends for 5 years and didn’t want to throw her out of my life. We ended up hooking up that night and i stayed over the next morning and we talked about various things for a few hours. felt like normal.

On monday she texts me she wants to see me again and we text for a few hours and i got the invite to come over but then last minute she said she was too drunk and we can wait till Tuesday.. No problem i did don’t make a big deal about it.. Tuesday comes and she’s out with her friends and tells me i can come come over later. I said as long as you’re home by midnight we can. I text her at midnight seeing if she’s home yet and she doesn’t reply for 30 minutes and says “she’s so sorry and her phone died”. I was irked and went to bed but texted her back in the morning that it was no big deal. We haven’t talked the last 2 days but i texted her last night “are you still on your period” bc she mentioned she started on Monday and she just didn’t respond to that text?

This was originally our fight in the first place bc of poor communication and she just does it a week later after i told her it bothered me.Am i overreacting here? i have too much pride to keep texting someone if i feel like i’m bothering them.

TLDR: My Fwb and I ended a month ago bc of poor communication. I see her out last week and we talked it out and ended up having sex that night but this week she’s kind of starting it again. I don’t get her actions. Or am i just overthinking this whole thing and i shouldn’t expect a reply?",,,,,,,,
my boyfriend (23M) told me he feels he’s losing attraction to me (22F). Can i respark attraction over long distance?,"we have been together for about 4 years now, 3 of those have been long distance. Because of the distance and our situation, we only see each other about 4-5 trips a year, at least a week or more each trip. other than that, we just text and call to fill the gap, but we are very good at having our own lives and just keep each other updated through it. 

he just told me that he feels like he’s struggling with his feelings of attraction towards me. 
this hit me really hard. lately i’ve been having a lot of body image issues because of weight gain i’ve had from a health issue. i’ve done a lot of work myself from changing my diet and activity and lifestyle to support weight loss, but because of my condition it is out of my hands for the time being. it has been VERY difficult to process that i don’t look the same that i used to AND that it is out of my hands. 
I noticed that because of these issues i’ve been having, im just so much more insecure than before. it’s hard for me to take pics of myself looking good (especially nudes) and send them because it’s hard for me to even look at myself right now. I feel like this is why his attraction is fading. when we’re together in person i’m totally fine, because i don’t have to see myself. 
he DIDNT say that it was the weight gain that has changed his attraction towards me, so maybe i’m just projecting my insecurities. 
My question is how can i try and re spark connection between us, even long distance? Is it even possible? Where do we go from here? 

TLDR: long distance boyfriend has said he is losing his attraction to me, is there anything i can do about that?",,,,,,,,
My (25m) girlfriend (24f) seems negative about my achievements," I started a new job around 7-8 months ago. I have to sit a lot of exams for this job after certain exams and as long as job performance is good you get a promotion and a good pay rise. Because of previous experience I can skip a few of the exams and because my performance is better than expected I will be getting the promotion earlier than expected. Initially it was supposed to be November at the earliest but because of the reasons I mentioned, my manager said it is likely o be April.

I was excited but got informed by the head of my department that it would likely be July-August instead. I was still happy since it was earlier that initially expected. I mentioned this to my gf and said it's slightly annoying since I was looking forward to it being next month and her response was just ""Some people won't be getting promotions at all. I wont be getting a pay rise anytime soon"". I asked her what that has to do with my promotion and the work I have put in to get it? I asked why, just because other people weren't getting promotions it meant I couldn't be excited about mine and slightly disappointed at it getting moved back a couple of months.

She just said I'm being entitled complaining about not getting more money sooner when people are on less than me. I asked why she couldn't just be pleased for me and she mentioned again that I knew she wouldn't be getting a promotion this year. The thing is, that's because she's currently working part time while at university and is starting a full time job in September. I mentioned again that that doesn't take away from my achievements and I expected m partner to be happy for me instead of putting me down. She said I'm refusing to see where she's coming from. Does anyone have any advice to how to handle the situation?

tl;dr my gf made negative comments when I was talking about my upcoming promotion. Does anyone have any advice?

Mom (54f) ignores when I tell her I’m going to do something (21f),"Hi.. this is complicated but I’ll try to make it short. I’m in a long distance relationship I’m (21f) my bf is (26m). And it’s really important to me to be able to go visit him. We’ve been planning a trip for a while.. like quite a while. And I’ve made two attempts to talk to my mom (54f) about wanting to go (it’ll be my first trip out of state by myself). But both times I’ve felt pushed off even though I’ve told her it’s important to me to be able to go. The first time she said she wanted me to make a plan and a timeline to make sure I’m safe going and that I could go soon.. it was disappointing but I went along with it because I want to respect what she has to say. So I took a week to put together a plan of what/where/how I’d get there and everything even times I’d leave/come home. But when I tried to ask her to look through it with me this morning she acted like she didn’t have the time of day to talk about it and all she said was “what vehicle are you going to drive, if you rent a car you’ll be charged extra. And you want to go by yourself???”.. and that was it, she changed the topic and started ranting about something else.

 I realize I’m an adult and I’m not trying to ask for her permission. Like I was trying to be polite and do the right thing but I feel like she just doesn’t care about what I want at all. Do I just make reservations and tell her one more time I’m going so she’s not surprised?

We discovered we have quite a bit in common, from a shared love of fairly obscure book series to history, traveling, and even birdwatching. BIRDWATCHING! I’ve never met anyone else who cared at all about that. 

There was never once I looked at him “like that” and it was all of maybe two weeks after we started talking that I found out he’s gay and in a relationship anyhow, so I didn’t feel like there was anything wrong with this, or anything to hide. 

Well…I wound up dumping my boyfriend over it. He became a huge, controlling, possessive asshole and really showed his true colors. I tried to be understanding at first - it’s not crazy for a guy to feel threatened by his girlfriend spending time with another man, and I knew he didn’t think men and women could be friends. 

But after I told my boyfriend about J being gay, it actually made it worse. He called me a liar! He said J was “too big and manly” to be gay. I wish I was joking, I really do, but legit this was his response. It was at that moment my attraction to him dropped to zero and I started wondering what I ever saw in him to begin with. We broke up shortly after and J also became single around this time, for unrelated reasons.

Since then, I’ve only loosely dated one other guy and he seemed similarly bothered by my friend, so it didn’t go anywhere.

J is my best friend at this point so our lives have overlapped a lot. We are admittedly an odd pair, which we recognize and have laughed at. He’s 35. I’m 24. He’s 6’4. I’m 5’2. He’s a guy and I’m a girl. Our differences pretty much end there though. I’m by far the youngest of his friends but until I told him how old I was when my birthday came up, he thought I was in my late 20s. 

We see each other at least once per week outside of work and text all of the time. It’s a little less lately since J got a boyfriend, and I tried to be respectful and fade into the background a little but his boyfriend is cool and has invited me for things as well lmao. 

The only people who seem to have an issue are the people in my life and it makes me feel so weird and annoyed. I’ve had such gross reactions from people. Someone once said he’s “grooming” me, knowing literally nothing about our relationship beyond the age difference. 

My parents are also very bothered by me having a male friend older than me as well and I’m very disappointed that has been their reaction. I’ve never had many friends period, even when I was a kid I was a loner without much in common with other kids, so if anything I thought they’d be happy. Actually, I didn’t expect them to have much of a reaction at all given that I’m 24, not 14. 

Well, J and I are planning a trip next month, about a 7hr road trip to Branson. I mention this in passing to my parents and they were clearly really uncomfortable and insisted that I check in with them the whole time. It honestly made me angry. I've traveled alone and they have never done this aside from ""text us when you get there"" so it's rather obvious why they are now.

We’re both adults and I’m not stupid, I can see red flags like anyone else and there haven’t been any.  To be clear, I have no intention of ruining this friendship, I'm just looking for different perspectives, and how to deal with these weird attitudes.

TL;DR: I am really good friends with a 35-year-old man I met at work and I'm 24F. Everyone acts like this is weird and inappropriate but I don't see the problem. I even broke up with my boyfriend over it. I don't understand what the big deal is and my parents are unhappy I'm going on a road trip with him.",,,,,,,,
partner refuses to accept break up,"throw away account. so i [31f] and my partner [30m] have been together for 9 years, living together for 7 and have 3 children together, oldest [9f], [5m] and youngest [2f]. For a bit of background, he was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and uses that and IBS as his excuse for not working, for not being able to just get up and clean, for not knowing how to do simple tasks properly etc, and over the years i have put things in place to help with some of this, for example a list of tasks that need doing daily or weekly and keeping very detailed recipes. 
over the past few years or more, i have been constantly trying to tell him im unhappy with how our relationship is, telling him he spends more time on his xbox or pc talking to friends, especially at night when the children are in bed. This made me feel very alone and isolated, especially when if i went out with friends, he would message me after a few hours asking when im coming home and asking me not to be too long as he dont like going to bed alone. Sex life over the past few years has been practically non existant; doesnt exactly put me in the mood when im cleaning around him and 3 children all day, spending most evenings alone and he asks when he is ready for going to bed if i want to ""do things"" later.
These past few months have been trying to say the least  I tried telling him i wanted to end the relationship and ive had enough of living this way and dont want to xontinue, but every time i try to break up with him, he makes excuses and refuses to listen.
The first time i tried to end things, he cried and after 4 or 5 attempts to break up, he made me agree to trying for another month. When that didnt work, he claimed i wasnt trying and decided lists of what we want in a relationship, to try again and see if that worked. Again, i tried telling him that it wasnt going to work and that it wasnt a good idea, but he somehow made me agree to it anyway. Apparently it shows when your heart isnt in it and im still not trying enough.
I have since tried for the third time to tell him i cant keep living like this, and he tried subtly hinting he will hang and stab himself if i break up with him (he wouldnt actually do it just to clarify, it was an attempt at emotionally manipulating me) but i wouldnt budge. As much as ive tried to be firm and hold my ground  theres only so much i could do. I cant forcefully kick him out as he will have nowhere to go and would end up living on the streets. He is currently trying to find couples therapy (never actually agreed to it he is basically taking it upon himself) and im unsure what to do any more. I feel like im going to be stuck in this purgatory hell of a nightmare for the rest of my life.

TL; DR Living with partner of 9 years who refuses to listen and accept break up, i feel trapped and dont know what to do.",,,,,,,,
Everyone around me does cocaine,"So I’m 26M and in recent years literally most of my friends have gotten into drugs. 

My housemate does coke. The girl I’m seeing does it. My friends from university in another city do it. Everyone in this city I live in do it. I think I know about 2 out of 20 friends who don’t. 

I don’t at all. And it makes me feel incredibly isolated. I try not to judge etc everyone does their own thing. But it’s how it makes me feel being around it all the time. Feeling like I don’t relate to my friends. 

I’m huge into fitness so most of the time I spend just on my own doing oly lifting atm. So I’m quite lonely. And the fact the girl I’m seeing does it kinda bothers me too. She’s not my gf but she’s the closest to it I’ve got lol. 

Any advice on how to deal with this? I’m finding it hard to meet other people who aren’t into it 

Tl;dr most people I know do cocaine.",,,,,,,,
Am I an asshole for not wanting to invite my bf (M27) when I(F25)hang out with my girlfriends,"My boyfriend always invites me to all the gatherings he and his friends make, but honestly I feel like having some girl-only time from time to time when I hang out with my girlfriends, In all my previous relationships my bfs would hang out with their friends without me (sometimes) and vice versa, and it was ok!

He expects to be invited always and I never told him no because I feel bad, and although I think it's cute he wants to be friends with them, I feel like I like a bit of independence (we live together)

How can I approach this without him feeling left out?
 Thanks!

TLDR; My bf expects to be invited everytime I hang out with my girlfriends and I don't know how to tell him I'd like a bit of independence without him feeling bad.",,,,,,,,
My (20f) mothers partner (43m) is interfering in my relationship w (20m) over his own racial views,"TL/DR: Mom (42f) partner (43m) ex from a country, that neighbors my boyfriends country, in the past. They ended on bad terms. My relationship is struggling because of this. Do i move out for the weekends i am home? 


Hi all,

Apologies in advance it’s long.
I don’t post i just lurk as many on here do. I need advice on how to approach a situation i have with my boyfriend of a year (20m). 

My boyfriend (20m) is not from my original country. He moved here when he was 2 years old with his parents and they have set up a great life for themselves. They aren’t by any means well off or rich but they would be middle class if you want to call it that.

My mothers (42f) partner (43m) and her have been together 8 years and together they have my sister (6f). I have a brother (16m) we will call Jack. Let’s call her partner Luke. 

Luke is an a-hole to put it nicely. He has always talked down to my mother, treated her with disrespect etc. Over the years he has broken my mother down so that she has no confidence in herself and she just does everything for him and he does not appreciate it. 

Luke has had his own past obviously like the rest of us. His ex partner is from a neighboring country to my boyfriends. It is a country that has a few stereotypes such as ‘They will steal from you’ and things like that. When my boyfriend and i were just meeting up getting to know one another he told me to get rid of him solely because of where he was born.

My boyfriend doesn’t look or sound any different. He has never met my boyfriend.  I pretended i stopped talking to my boyfriend but we kept meeting up. My mother knew and so did my eldest brother (16m). My boyfriend is an amazing person he always makes sure i am safe and ok. I work late shifts and he is always there to collect me to bring me home no matter what time. I don’t want to ramble on about what he does for me but just know he is a lovely person and his mother raised him right.

Anyway, in March Luke found out about me and my boyfriend i decided enough was enough and i got my mother to tell him. She pretended she didn’t know anything about us which was her choice i won’t tell her what to do. Luke wasn’t happy, he lay down a few of his own rules such as ‘He’s not allowed near *insert both brothers names*’ (he isn’t my eldest brothers father and they don’t get along) ‘He isn’t allowed in the house’ (it’s my mothers house) ‘He’s not allowed drop you to the door i don’t want him anywhere near me’ (my boyfriend obviously wants to make sure i’m there safe).

Now since Luke knowing life has gotten harder for me and my boyfriend. We had plans to go to the cinema tonight but Luke isn’t allowing it. My mother says it’s Luke testing me to see will i bring my boyfriend to the house while they are out tonight.My eldest brother has babysitted so many times in the past and he said he will do it again tonight so i can go through with my plans as he has none. 

My grandparents are my biggest supporters in this situation, i know if i ever needed i have a plan at their house which isn’t far from me right now (walking distance). I am seriously considering just leaving to their house for the weekends as i am in college Mon-Fri 1.5 hrs away from home. I also work the weekends too so i’m not even at home a lot.

I think what i’m asking from reddit is advice? what do i do? His racial views to one singular country over one person is effecting my relationship. 

Info: His ex didn’t harm him they just broke up on bad terms as they let the relationship get worse before actually ending it.",,,,,,,,
My girlfriend (19F) was seeing other people while talking to me (23M),"tl:dr - Girlfriend hooked up with co-worker several times while we were talking and after she was inviting me over for movies (before we got together); I don't know how to feel or proceed.   


This post might seem really trivial compared to most other posts on here, but I'm going through a lot of emotions right now and I'm not entirely sure how to feel, so I'm hoping to get some insight from others.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I started dating beginning of February, but have known each other since November of 2021 and both started to develop feelings for each other in April of 2022. We're both in a college town together, so we both went home for the summer between school years and didn't talk much despite our feelings for each other (unknown to each other). 

&amp;#x200B;

We started talking more and more in October of 2022, then at the beginning of December she invited me over to watch a movie with her a couple times but I unfortunately had to decline due to work commitments (I likely would've turned down the offer anyways as I am shy and was too much of a chicken to go over knowing what might happen lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally at the beginning of February, she invited me over for a movie again and I accepted. Couple nights over there, and we ended up starting a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

We've both been very open about past partners etc. However, she recently talked about a co-worker from her summer job that she hooked up twice with in late December, after she had invited me over for movies and was talking to me on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said before, this might sound really trivial but I'm a bit torn on this whole thing, that she went and hooked up with a former (and future this summer) co-worker while she was trying to start a relationship with me. 

And fwiw, she had 3 other hookups in October/November while we were talking and interested in each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something I should be concerned about? How should I proceed going forward?",,,,,,,,
My [22M] girlfriend [20F] says she will leave me if I don’t admit what I did was wrong.,"I’ll try to make this short. I have a longer explanation in a different post on my profile.

I [22M] have been with my girlfriend [20F] for almost a year, and no one has ever understood me or loved me like she has, and I love her a lot and don’t want to lose this.

I am on a 4-day family trip that has been planned for six months. She has been feeling depressed within the past week, and told me she needed me to reschedule my family trip. She was crying the night before and the day I left and said she wouldn’t be okay if I left. She said I don’t need to act as her therapist, all she needed was for me to stay back for this one trip until she was okay, then I could see my family the next week.

Now she is saying the only way she will stay in the relationship is if I admit what I did was wrong and promise that she will come first the next time she needs me. Am I being selfish here?  I feel bad about what I did but I still want to see my family, just for a few days. If I’m in the wrong, I would appreciate if someone can explain if my priorities are out of order.  What can I do or say to fix this?

I said I want time to talk to a therapist, but she says it’s not fair to her to make her wait for my trip to be over to finish this discussion.

Let me know if more info is needed, thanks in advance.

TL;DR My girlfriend told me I need to admit that I was wrong to leave her while she was depressed for a family vacation, or else she will leave me.  I need help knowing what I can say or if I should say anything at all.",,,,,,,,
Should my partner (M22) and I (25F) be communicating issues verbally instead of over text?,"When I’m upset about something I prefer to type out what I want to say. However, sometimes I can only let my partner, of nearly a year, know how I feel through text. It’s not because I can’t talk to them. It’s more so that I struggle to verbally express all that I’m feeling. My words get muddled and I forget things so I never feel like I’ve expressed myself fully. Over text, I can lay it out properly and revise it to make sure it is exactly what I want to say, and not harsh or critical (mostly because I have a tendency to be a bit too blunt). 

We call after (we’re long distance since July until May/June) to try and reconnect and discuss anything around it. So we do then have verbal and (distanced) face to face time. 

I guess I’m just worried that this will actually cause more disconnect. I’m also worried that if I don’t practice verbally expressing then I’ll never able to. He’s back in the country soon, so I’m worried about how I’ll deal with issues that arise then. Will it be silly to still text even if we’re in the same house? Even if it helps me to express?

Tl;dr: I express my feelings through text because I struggle to verbally articulate. Will this be a problem for our relationship?",,,,,,,,
First love struggles,"So forgive me as this will be a long post (as I need to provide context to the story), but I really do feel like I need some advice or even just to write this down to people who may understand where I'm coming from. 

**Context incoming...**

I was with my ex-boyfriend for nearly seven years from the age of 17-24, who was my first boyfriend and love. I loved him more than I ever thought possible, we got on SO well, he was loyal, honest, ambitious, funny, we *very rarely* argued about anything and I really did think we were a great match as we balanced each other's qualities out well. I'm not saying he was perfect (because who is) by any means. Our families accepted each other as if we were their own and I thought that we did a great job of growing with each other throughout a key period of turning into 'proper adults.' 

Then we went through a period in the last few months of our relationship where he was super withdrawn, didn't want to spend any time together (aside from sitting on opposite couches scrolling our phones) and started spending more time at work. Despite me constantly asking if he was OK (and being reassured that he was and that he was just stressed at work too), planning fun date nights for us and making our favourite meals in an attempt to bring us closer again, he still seemed completely different.

I realised that the stress of my job may have been taking a bit of a toll and I actually made the move to find a new job in the hope that this would bring some life back into our relationship. 

In the end, I ran out of things I could do to try and save what we had, so I suggested we went on a break. Well, he kind of left me no option as I was at the end of my tether and he was giving me nothing. We lasted a week on the break and then we had a face-to-face where he finally admitted to my face that he no longer loved me....and on the first day of my new job, we split up for good.

It absolutely broke me to pieces and I honestly feel like I've never been the same since. The reason for the break-up was something I had completely no control over (I mean, what do you say to that?) and I was very much still in love with him and truly thought I'd found my life partner and I love so deeply that it meant a lot to me.

**How I'm feeling now...**

This was four years ago now. I've been through multiple rounds of therapy to try and heal from all of this, and whilst I do feel like I'm so much stronger and a completely different person to what I was four years ago, I still hold SUCH a candle for my ex and I really don't ever see it going away. 

I haven't really spoken to him since we broke up, but I have seen him a couple of times at his parents house (when I was visiting them) and we literally just pick up talking and laughing like nothing has ever happened. It's so natural with us. He also came to my grandad's funeral last year, as he had high respect for him.

I think about him regularly, I really struggle to find a strong connection with other men (I've been dating for years) that goes anywhere in this day and age and I am also still close to his mother and father. Meanwhile, he has since had two girlfriends but his mum still tells me he's completely different with them to how he was with me and doesn't seem as happy. 

Will I always feel this way? It truly does feel like that sometimes and it really makes me feel like I'm completely stupid for holding onto a past relationship, when he's so easily moving on and finding other people like I didn't exist. What if he was my 'person' and that's why I can't find a connection with anyone else? I just thought that four years later, I'd at least have made some kind of significant progress about this situation, or at least be able to say that I'd moved on from it all.  

I know there's not really an answer, but do you truly believe you can move on from a first love that was so seemingly easy &amp; right? I've come to this place in the hope that someone is feeling (or has felt) anything remotely similar to my circumstance and if things ever changed for them. Right now, I feel like I'll feel like this forever.  


\---  

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : Had a 7 year relationship from 17-24 (he fell out of love with me), four years later I'm still really struggling to move on from my ex-boyfriend (he's had 2 long term GFs since me) and also find real connections with other men (I've had none). I've stayed single all this time. Has anyone else experienced this and can you ever truly move on from a first love when it was so easy &amp; you seemed like you were a perfect match? Really struggling to find a positive and just feel like I'll feel like this forever.",,,,,,,,
My girlfriend (17F) tends to get upset at me (16M) because she thinks I'm sometimes judging or talking down to her.," 

As the title states. My girlfriend will sometimes come to the conclusion that I am trying to call her dumb or judge her or look down on her when I talk about certain things, which doesn't help because she already is sometimes prone to bouts of moodiness or sometimes rapid mood shifts.

Today we had an incident over text where she told me she got a Google One subscription to have more space to store her photos and I said that she could have gotten and SD Card, she replied with No because she just likes having everything on Google Photos and that she hates cards.

I said Why physical memory is way better and she kind of got an attitude at me and said I don't know I just don't like it, I like what I did doesn't matter. It's super cheap anyway.

So I said I guess (Like a casual oh okay that's cool i guess) and she got upset and said she'll talk to me later. So she got upset at me and said that I don't like to shares things with her and that she was telling me something random and she wasn't looking for me to tell her what's best in my opinion. And she said not to be a jerk but she didn't ask for that

I said I didn't mean to come off as rude and t hat maybe I'm coming off the wrong way when I talk to you about certain stuff and she just said

You're bad at texting  
I don't like texting with you

I told her I really don't like texting but I know she does so I try to compromise but when she said that it just really hurt my feelings.

TL;DR my girlfriend got mad at me because she thought I was calling her dumb and then got mad at me.",,,,,,,,
[30F] still a virgin - is this considered a problem?,"Hi Reddit!

I sometimes get a little anxious because I just turned 30 and I am still a virgin. It just didn't happen yet, as I focused on my education and career, and then I was always self-conscious about being a virgin from when I was like 22 onwards (which seems ridiculous to me now).

I am considered a very attrative woman and I usually have good social skills, so it's not like nobody was ever interested in me - I was just a bit insecure about being a virgin, and now it's bleeding a bit into my anxiety disorder (which I'm in treatment for now).

How should I go on about this? What's your general consensus here, is it really that big of a problem as I make it out to be?

TL;DR: still a virgin, what to think about this?",,,,,,,,
[22m][22f] could someone with alot of experience please give me your advice?,"I consider anything type of cheating a deal breaker, emotional or physical for context.

Long story short me and my gf met on on tinder. After we met we deleted tinder, she told me I was the only guy she was talking to at the moment. And I asked when the last time she talked to one guy she mentioned and she said it's been months really.

Didn't think much of it but then a month into our relationship we have misunderstanding about her texting someone. She said she didn't text a guy back but in reality after she said that she did and didn't tell me ( was some dude she was friends with in highschool and said he was a weird dude that used to hit on a bunch of girls). And I got upset and told her that was weird and she blocked him and a month later I figure out she just felt bad and texted him back.

Because I didn't know that I went through her phone and discovered that dude in the beginning that said she didn't really text on months texted her 4 days after we got together and said ""if you're ever in Atlanta you should visiting"" and she said ""HELL YE I WILL"", and that's what was said. Then a few weeks later he drunkenly texted her ""you're a good friend"" and she responded ""HUH WHAT"". And I looked backed and they miscellaneouslly texted a couple times a month before we got together.  After I pointed out there chat, the next day she chat was deleted, but she didn't know that Iwent through her phone. Oh and apparently they hung out once and apparently it went terrible ( 6 months before we got together). According to her they only ever seen each other as friends and neither wanted anything more. I then truth tested her to see if she would tell me what they talked about and she said everything except the part where he said the Atlanta thing and what she said. Oh and befire our first date she told him how excited she was to to go on a date with me and refered to me as "" a close friend"" ( before we were together). 

I told her what she did was very Inappropriate and awful. So she ended up blocking him and apologizing to me.

Well I then check her phone again and went down her recently added on Snapchat and found a guy who was added but not showing up on the Snapchat feed. ( I do gotta admit I have seen her Snapchat glitch and show people but this guy had a snascore unlike the other so that means they were friends) So I accused her of deleting it and she's says that she's never deleted anything else after that one time because she understood how much it hurt me. But on the data it said ""delete, add, then another delete because i deleted him"" Long story short I checked her data and discovered in the first month of us being together she blocked 6 guys and I only was aware of 4 and I asked who they were and she said she didn't didn't remember.

Now she has been abused by her father and been in a toxic relationship  before and has bad memory so I don't know if that effects anything.


Long story short me and my gf have been together 8 months and after we got together I found a something written that said ""I'm glad we me, we started talking again"" but it had a different guys name, i know it was written before we started dating but it still kinda hurt. 

Then yesterday ( after we been together for 8 months ) I found the dudes Instagram and they weren't following each other but I found a like on a post of his ( from 10 days before we got together) and I kinda flipped out on my gf and told her a bunch of things, I said she was a lair, accused her of possibly cheating, and how I was probably just a little rebound and how she probably was just using me, and that she better not have messaged him at all while we've been together.

I don't remember seeing a text chat from him but it's 10 days before we got together so I accused her of deleting the chat so I asked to see her Instagram data to which she replied ""yeah"", ( she was at work ) then when we see each other she was like "" you didn't even listen OR consider how I felt during all those awful things you said"" and bursted out crying lecturing me on how badly I hurt her feelings and how I need to be more considerate and how she didn't like me comparing her to my ex and how she was mad at me and how ""toxic"" it was to request this  of her. I told her it was sus that she would call it toxic

She then explain why it's disrespectful to her even though we have an open phone policy for this. Said it reminded her of her dad and mom's toxic relationship of what I did. 

We get home and basically she locked herself in the bathroom and vomits cause she so ""stressed"". So I threatened to message the guy if she didn't let me see and she came out and said I was being unnecessary.

And I was like oh so you must be hiding something then we had a huge conversation about how she doesn't want to be toxic and wanted me to be the man she married one day, but what I was doing was toxic and she was scared of that and explained she lost a bit of respect for me and that she doesn't wanna break up but for me to reflect on my actions and treat her better for what I did and how I should just trust her. I then said yeah I trust you and she was like "" no you think you do, but you really don't or else you wouldn't be asking something toxic like this"". Then one day I was going through her Instagram comments and there was a comment that said ""HOWS YOUR DASY GOING"" and the account was deleted, so I accused her of commenting on his account and deleting it in which she says that's literally crazy. Then I asked her one day if the comment was still there and she was like ""idk I guess when people delete their accounts it delets the comment"" and I was like why didn't you tell me it was deleted and she was like ""idk i didn't think it was important, was nothing was a girl's account"" I've never seen her comment on a guys account though, so Idk if I'm just overthinking 

I have gone through snap before and did find she deleted him about a week before we met, but I found the like on his post 3 days after we met ( just met, not together ) she didn't comment on it - and from what I remember she said she unfollowed him before we got together.

It's been rough these past couple days because of this, she says that she would never do anything to hurt me and she's never done anything else since the first deletion because she seen how bad it hurt me. She's a really sweet girl and after my last little breakout she suggested we delete social media and just focus on getting healthy like we used to be. She immediately give some reassurance anytime I need it and says she never done anything bad to me ever and most of the stuff I'm saying is just blatantly incorrect and hasn't happened at all, she does say that I tend to just believe only myself and not listen to whats he's saying. I like this girl, I just don't wanna not see something and be screwed over and not know 

My question is, how can this be deemed toxic? I feel as if I'm in the right, I want proof, words without evidence is just WORDS


TL;DR need real life advice",,,,,,,,
My boyfriend (21 M) broke up with me (19F) because he says our personalities are too different,"My boyfriend and I were dating for the past 10 months, and things went really well for most of it. He was extremely caring and kind, and did things constantly like make me breakfast, plan dates, and drive me to where I need to be. I like to believe that I was a good girlfriend to him too, I was always helping him in any way that I could and reminding him how happy I was to be in our relationship.

Last week he broke up with me. Apparently he wanted to break up with me for a week but waited because he wanted more time with me, we literally went on a dinner and axe throwing date that he planned during this week. I also had exams during this week, but it hurts knowing he was over almost everyday that week knowing he wanted to end things.

He said that he thinks our interests are too different. But when it comes to morals and beliefs, we are pretty much identical. 

To preface, we are both nerds. He is into things like Star Wars, Lego, comics, D&amp;D and the card game magic. I’m not really familiar with these things, but I always want to learn and every time he asked me to do one of his hobbies I always said yes. I’m more of a nerd when it comes to school things.

He said in his text to me that he doesn’t think I enjoy the things that he does. But I told him that he never really fully gave me the chance to even learn: he never taught me how to play D&amp;D and he stopped showing me the Star Wars movies. Every time he was showing me something new, I would always be fully invested and attentive, not on my phone or doing something else.

I shared that I didn’t think it was fair to say that I don’t like doing these things with him if he never let me in to do them. I never had the chance to learn. Yesterday he texted me saying that he should’ve given me more of a chance and that he feels stupid right now. He said that if he ever wanted to get back together that he couldn’t because “he has ruined everything.”

Near the end of our relationship, he became very checked out. He didn’t care if I was walking home at night and he would just sit in my room for 3 hours doing work and not talking to me. I told him that it felt like he didn’t want to be here. And he apologized every time and said he would work on it. He also said in his texts to me that he doesn’t know why he can’t open up, and that I deserve someone who is able to care about me.

The messages he is sending me are so confusing. Not even 12 hours after our breakup he’s saying that he should’ve given me another chance. I don’t know what to think about this, it seems like to me he was feeling upset and instead of telling me, he bottled it up and made a rash decision. When I started moving our stuff from my room, he had a breakdown and started asking me not to throw stuff away, even though he was the one to break up with me. I’m just feeling very lost right now.

This is both of our first long term relationships, and we were each other’s first love. I really didn’t want to end things because I saw a future together and I really didn’t thing our time together was done.

I need advice on how to go from here. I’ve told him no contact for now, but also said that I might message him occasionally when I need to (I don’t think I can never speak to him again). He said that he still wants me in his life and when I told him no contact he replied “goodbye for now” (and then a nickname that he calls me). He told me he also reached out to a therapist about learning to open up. How do I go about healing our relationship, or healing myself from this? I think I want to get back together right now, but not until he matures emotionally.

TL;DR: my boyfriend broke up with me but I can’t tell if he regrets it because he’s sending mixed signals, I need advice on where to go from here.",,,,,,,,
trust issues," 

I will do some context setting.

Me (22F) and my boyfriend (23M)

tl;dr we can't trust each other, I still feel like I should give it a shot

\- I have been single all 22 years of my life, until 3 months ago. I moved away from my parents for the very first time for work 3 months ago &amp; life is changing too fast.

I started liking a guy in Feb 2022, in end of Feb I find out that he already has a girlfriend I feel hurt but then I move on, we keep taking because we were working together on something.

Cut to April he tells me he just broke up, we start spending exponentially more time together mean while I am also losing focus in studies and not preparing well enough for jobs. My friend circle also shrinks and is almost restricted solely to him.

We do have issues in this while as well, he is extremely critical and views everything as grey that really disturbs me and affects my relations with other people as they have all been sullied.

But I still find him very interesting because there was so much we could talk about and we did talk for unnaturally long.

Bringing up 2 key facts here:

\- He spends so much time with me when he is smart and could work on finding a great job \[I still don't know why he doesn't \]

\- I am really conflict averse, low on confidence, assertiveness and self esteem. (and dumb?) at least that what he made me feel like most of the time. I also talk too much and unnecessarily.

I tell him in Aug '22 that I like him (this was my first time telling someone that) he gives me a ""shh you don't want to say this"" and straight up ignores me when I bring this up again.

On Nov '22 I ask him if I should bother waiting anymore and I get a ""You are free"". I was very hurt but things moved on since I got a job around that time and had to move out.

In the new city \[ Jan '22 \] I meet a friend of 9 years in the evening over dinner we both go back to my company accommodation and talk for a while then he wanted to stay over, I saw no harm. Next day the guy I like (lets call him A) calls me out of nowhere I end up telling him about how big an issue my mom made about a friend staying over.

He gets really pissed and lectures me on that's why he never emotionally committed or said yes. It very deeply feels like he is calling me a sl\*t -&gt; Asks me if I want companionship or space? I choose latter, he sends me a text despite that and blocks me after a long message about how he loves me but is rational and can't be surrounded by me .

I had never been blocked in my lifetime and got really really scared and hurt I end up telling my mom and crying for a long time. I was only collecting myself when A wants back in and has completely changed in how he treated me and is really persuasive and makes claims of having always loved me.

\- I was in his city for a wedding, we meet, it feels really warm. I say yes, we start dating.

\- Start spending soo much time together that it starts affecting work and makes me feel real weak

\- I have to start lying to my parents for the very first time in life

\- We have a good time together (talking sexy and philosophy) but we are weird in the public

\- We have trust issues on both sides, also he blames me of being cheap and bases it on his insights on human behavior ( to be fair he is unnaturally right about a lot of those things ) but that makes me doubt myself and makes me even more uncomfortable in my head and dipping confidence that I need on all fronts of my life at the moment, especially work.

\- My plan for upskill start failing so do his.

\- He makes significant financial commitments upfront further disturbing the natural equilibrium and this makes me very uncomfortable.

I feel like it has a significant cost for both of us yet there are definitely some potential, I am also legit addicted to him in the sense that because he makes me feel so dumb it feels like I will screw up without him + most of my bonds feel shallow because of his ""grey"" thing.

Also, friend sleeping over becomes one of the corner stone issues in the relationship and gets labelled as ""boundary issues""",,,,,,,,
My boyfriend (21M) just broke up with me (19F) because he says our personalities are too different,"My boyfriend and I were dating for the past 10 months, and things went really well for most of it. He was extremely caring and kind, and did things constantly like make me breakfast, plan dates, and drive me to where I need to be. I like to believe that I was a good girlfriend to him too, I was always helping him in any way that I could and reminding him how happy I was to be in our relationship.

Last week he broke up with me. Apparently he wanted to break up with me for a week but waited because he wanted more time with me, we literally went on a dinner and axe throwing date that he planned during this week.

"(M21) I have fallen madly in love with a friend (F23)! I've never felt this way before, and have no clue what to do","this has never really happened to me before. i'm not a particularly emotional person. Iive dated quite a lot of people in the past, but I've never been crazy about someone. i was never super-invested emotionally, which sucked, but also protected me in a way. I was never ever nervous.

but now, I've fallen for my friend, and it kinda terrifies me. Right now I'm probably the most nervous person in the world. I'm even more nervous because there is a chance she might like me too. 

in the past few months, she's started sending hearts in her texts, when we've went out to eat, she's insisted she pay for my food, she wanted me to be her ""plus one"" at an event, when we hang out, she hugs me, even though she not touchy feely, and she's commented on my physique several times. she's also been extremely supportive when i've had tough times,

my friends say she likes me, a mutual friend that i met through her suggested i ask her out, but i'm really scared i'm just reading things wrong. these feelings are so different from what I've had before that i have no idea how to act.

this is all so new to me

I’m worried by boyfriend finds me too clingy,"I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (22) for 3 months and it’s been great. I stay at his a few nights a week but recently it’s been always me initiating it, and he makes jokes that he’s getting sick of me. My mental health recently hasn’t been great, I’m in the process of getting help for anxiety. The only time I truly feel better is when I’m with him but he doesn’t seem to understand how much he means to me because he’s so laid back. I have to ask him to text me and otherwise he just lets me do everything. He’s also going to work abroad in May and the thought of having a LDR really stresses me out. 

Yesterday he told me he’s going away for the weekend even though we’d kind of made plans and I just started crying uncontrollably because I was really looking forward to going out together. He couldn’t see why I was so upset so I texted him this morning explaining that I want to make the most of the time we had left together and he just replied with “ok”. I know we love each other and when we’re together he’s obsessed with me too, but he’s so terrible at making plans when we’re apart that I’m worried he finds me too needy. Should I try and explain again why it makes me upset that he doesn’t put in as much effort, or just accept it and assume that everything is good on his end unless he tells me otherwise?

Tl:dr - I’m always imitating things with my boyfriend and I’m worried he’s going to resent me",,,,,,,,
27f 31m How do I approach this topic of differences in our background and him being a mentor?,"This guy (31m) and I (27f) have been seeing each other for 2 months in person and with him being away for 3 months, he’ll be returning home soon.

No, we’re not boyfriend/girlfriend.

To give context, Bill (let’s call him that) comes from a vast different background than me ( more travel, more opportunities all that) and although he had a moment  
In his life where he was at his lowest, he picked himself up and doing well for himself financially and all that. 

I, (27f) on the other hand, have come from more of a sheltered small town background  and still am flailing. I’m more greyed out as a person and naive about the world, people.

I don’t feel jealous of him but at times I worry he thinks I’m bland and well not enough. Or worse, he pities me. When it gets to topics of travel or things he done, I go mute because I don’t know what to say. I think he tries to downplay them or not mention his experiences at all. 

He’s a really sweet, good guy. I fear I’m being a burden on him because of my background and the fact I make less money than him (my salary would be considered working poor) and he’s in tech.

I worry if we go into a relationship he’s going tom feel disdain with how much I make bc it limits what we can do or make him feel like he has to constantly treat me.
 

It’s not like Im not trying hard to be better but can I keep up?


In my past relationships or interactions I feel like I’ve always been more the mentee and the other guy is a mentor because he’s more experienced in those things,ie waysof the world.

Tl:dr: Dating a guy who comes from a very different background than me where there were more opportunists and makes more money than me. It’s been weigh heavily on my mind, I’m the sense of how much  it affect us being together. Not sure if I should even bring my worries up or keep them to myself.",,,,,,,,
All my flatmate does it talk about his gf,"I’m 26M and so is he. We moved in together 5 months ago. 

He got a gf within the first month of being here and honestly it’s driving me up the wall. He seems to think that I’m really invested in this relationship when in truth I’m happy he’s met someone but I couldn’t give really give a shit how it’s going. 

All he does is talk about her. Like. Literally that’s it. All conversations end up looping back to something about her. 

I still haven’t met her (which is weird considering we live together) and he’s gotten really upset at me coz I’m not going to the pub tonight to ‘formally meet her’ as I’ve got something else I want to do. 

I’m seeing someone atm but it’s not bf and gf and it’s not really going anywhere. I’ve never had good success with relationships and honestly they give me anxiety. So having to hear about this non stop is driving me nuts. Bringing me down. Making me feel shit. 

How do I deal with this. I don’t want to just tell him to stop as I’ll look like an asshole but fuck me it’s driving me mental. 

Tl;dr housemate won’t stop going on about his gf and it’s driving me nuts",,,,,,,,
UPDATE: How do I (24F) tell my friend (26F) that she has ruined our friendship?,"Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11qqdc0/how\_do\_i\_24f\_tell\_my\_friend\_26f\_that\_she\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11qqdc0/how_do_i_24f_tell_my_friend_26f_that_she_has/)

Thanks for the advice on original, just wanted to update with the outcome.

I spoke to her.

I told her everything that's been on my mind for months and how she's made me feel about certain things. I made a point that I felt like our friendship was unfair and that my boundaries had been disrespected. I also highlighted her constant negativity and of course, her obsession for this celebrity.

I was trying to be kind about things. I told her she needs to get help because she clearly has some issues. She skipped over the celebrity obsession in one paragraph, where she admits she has an unhealthy attachment and says the way she has shared things with me makes it out to be far bigger than it actually is. I strongly disagreed with her on that and she avoided that topic again.

Instead she turned the blame of me for not being open and communicating enough and it's my fault my boundaries were not set in place better. That's partly correct, but in my defense, I didn't feel comfortable discussing them because I had a feeling she'd make me guilty for setting them.

Maybe I'm just wired different because I assume that if someone goes quiet for a day or two, that generally gives me the idea that they want some space.

I don't ask for much from her and I just wanted her to see it from my perspective I guess. I wasn't going to message her but I'm not the kind of person who will block and ghost, stupidly wishing I had taken advice from original post and done exactly that. I'm a dumbass!

She has said that she hopes I haven't been offended and hurt by things that **I've** taken the wrong way, not accepting the fact that some of the things she has said genuine were hurtful.

She has summed it up like this:

*So yeah, I have things to watch out for, but so do you. Try to be better at letting people in so that you can have a chance at making real connections and history doesn't repeat itself.*

I asked her to respect my boundaries and not message me again and she has then sent me a document with 2.5k words repeating herself and trying to highlight me as the main problem. And then another two massive paragraphs this morning.

Moral of the story, if you have a friend like this, just walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : UPDATE: I tried to be honest and tell her how I feel and the blame was thrown back at me. Moral of the story, if you have a friend like this, just walk away.",,,,,,,,
My bf (32M) of 5 years hasn't had sex with me (25F) in a year because I cheated.,"So two years ago I cheated on my bf. We were technically broken up at the time it happened, but since I was talking to the guy while we were still together it was cheating. Shortly after it happened, I felt horrible and told my bf. He was very upset, but we got back together and things were okay for a little while.

Fast forward two years and we haven’t had sex in a year. Before that it was 6 months. Now, I don’t need sex all the time, but it’s still super important to me and going a year without really sucks. I know I messed up by cheating and betraying his trust so I gave him time and hoped eventually things would naturally get better. Since they never did and it’s now been a year, I told him we need to have a talk about it. He started crying and told me he still felt betrayed by me and didn’t know what to do about the no sex issue. Since I’m the guilty one, I didn’t want to push him so we dropped topic.

My question is what should I do? I’m stuck in a sexless relationship, that I don’t want to end because I love him and I can’t get mad because it’s my fault. Is our sex life just doomed now?

TL;DR! - I cheated on my bf two years ago and now he doesn't want to have sex with me. What to do?",,,,,,,,
28M Need some advice about my ex 31F,"My girlfriend broke up with me and I went on her Facebook to check who she was speaking too.

I don't know how to deal with this or bring it up to her without her exploding on me and feeling I was being invasive on her privacy. We are supposed to get back together but this made me really mad. I don't know how to go about this at all without her getting extremely mad.

tl;dr My girlfriend broke up with me and I checked on her Facebook to find out she was speaking to her ex. Don't know how to bring it up with her exploding on me",,,,,,,,
Problems after I (23M) moved in with my girlfriend (23F),"My girlfriend (23F) and I (23M) have been living together for nearly a year now, this year it will be 5 years together. Before living together we had a pretty solid relationship, only fighting occasionally but reconciling well. Ever since moving in together we fight non stop, whether it be about the dishes, cleaning or just a simple disagreement  but when she gets angry I become the worst person in the world and get yelled at and put down. I'm by no means a perfect person, but I see myself as very calm and I don't always understand where the anger comes from.

The biggest problem in our relationship has always been weed, I enjoy smoking and have since way before I met her. I don't care that she doesn't smoke and I even realize that it was getting out of hand and I wasn't being a very attentive partner so we decided to compromise. I can only smoke 3 days a week now and only when we're not spending time together, whatever that's something I can live with. The problem is that there is no sort of wiggle room with this. I went to a concert with my friend a couple weeks ago and smoked with him so apparently I get in trouble for smoking 4 days of the week instead of 3. She phrases it as if I'm ""choosing a substance over her"". She has recently asked me to basically stop drinking and she says I can only have 2 beers on the weekend, I objected and told her I don't want to follow that rigid rule but apparently I'm being disrespectful to her if I don't. I'm by no means an alcoholic and weed and alcohol no way effects my work or my day to day life (outside of this relationship). I even made the effort to stop drinking during the week for myself not for her but I don't see anything wrong with enjoying a few beers on the weekends.

I love my girlfriend and I think she's a good person but the anger is really getting out of control, she'll personally attack me and put me down when she's angry. She knows at this point I'm not going to just follow her every wish because I do try to set boundaries, but that's sometimes responded to with passive aggressiveness until it explodes in my face. There are so many other examples of things other than weed or drinking that she'll get really mad at me about but I'm starting to get really frustrated with how much it feels like she is trying to control my life. 

I understand not wanting to be around weed and not wanting a partner that's always high but I really worry this ""compromise"" will continue to get out of hand. I worry she's always going to feel like ""I'm choosing substances over her"". I don't really want a life where everything is so rigid and I don't want to have to ask for permission everytime I want to smoke or have a beer. 

I know I'm still young, she's my first real girlfriend and things were very different when we had our seperate lives in university. I just don't know what to do from here.

TLDR: I'm tired of compromising with my girlfriend and constantly feeling bad for doing things that I like to do.",,,,,,,,
"I (22F) am upset because a coworker (22M) confessed feelings to me, even though we both have partners. I don't know how to handle the situation because we work together and are in the same friend group."," TL/DR: A coworker (22M) called me (22F) after hanging out with a group from work and confessed feelings, even though he has a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend. I'm upset because he put me in an awkward position and this seems to happen every time I make guy friends. I don't know how to handle this situation. Please read the whole text before commenting because I'm afraid to sound stuck-up, but I'm genuinely upset.

I started working somewhere a month ago, and I met some friends here, and it made work genuinely fun. A group of 2 girls and 3 guys, all in our early twenties. I went out with them yesterday and it was great. I even told them some personal things. I really love that group.

Then afterwards one of the guys called me and confessed he is into me. Now, that isn't a bad thing but he has a girlfriend and apparently lied to her about what group he went out with. I feel so sorry for the girl, and I will pressure him to tell her because she doesn’t deserve this stuff and she deserves a better boyfriend. It is also weird: I have literally had like 5 conversations with this guy in total. I don't get it.

I have a boyfriend too, and he knows that. I even told my new friends how much my boyfriend means to me and how he helped me out of my depression. I just don’t understand why he would do this to his girlfriend, and put me in that position too, especially after what I told them about my boyfriend. Like seriously, what did he expect me to say?

I'm disappointed and it is a pattern. This is not the first time this happens. Almost every guy friend I make hits on me after a month or so. I know so many guys that are great and I want to be friends with them. It just seems to happen every single time. Even when I think it won't. It makes me feel like I’ll never be a person to a guy. I’m not a person, I’m a girl. I’m either sexually or romantically interesting, or I’m not interesting at all, and I hate it. I just want to get to know people and talk to them without other intentions. I stopped making one on one guy friends, because they seem to take it the wrong way when I am friendly and I don't want to lead someone on or be mean. But I thought making friends in a group would be different.

So because of this I lost another friend group. I'm young and I don't know how to handle this correctly. I can't just keep hanging out with this group now. I feel like that won't be right to my partner. But I want to be friends with the others. I had a great time. But that means I'll have to be around him too, and I don't want to. I told the other girl in the group, mostly to warn her in case he is suddenly in love with her too. I did not tell the other guys.

Before this all happened, he invited all of us to do something together again next week. But after I rejected him I got uninvited.

Should I withdraw from the whole group? Or is there a way I can keep being friends with the others? Maybe someone has had a similar experience? I don't want him to lose the friend group either, even though it is clearly him that is messing stuff up.

(Just want to make sure I'm understood: I'm not upset that he has feelings for me. He can't control his feelings. I'm upset he lied to his girlfriend, I'm upset he confessed feelings to me and put me into this position even though he knows how much I love my partner. I'm upset I'm losing my new friend group and I'm not invited anymore. And I'm mostly upset because this is a pattern that keeps happening.)",,,,,,,,
"How do I become ""W-word that rhymes with ore""","I'm not at all ugly but I have very low self confidence and never built up the courage to talk to girls. So now I'm 20M and haven't even touched a girl, let alone kiss or date. All my friends are banging girls in college and I'm here unloved and unwanted, a piece of shit stuck to someone's desk

So I figured first I need a good body, went on vomit everyday fat loss injection treatment and went from 101KG to 79KG, so relatively presentable body check.

Face, always thought my glasses were nerdy and ugly so I went and got laser eye surgery. Lucky genes means I don't have any acne or scars. Nose is VERY slightly croaked but my mother said that's too major of a surgery to do now. So good face half check?

Here comes the question, how do I bed girls? I want to be the stereotypical playboy and get female attention..... But at the same time not hurt or betray anyone's feelings. I actually want to marry and care for someone I love for the rest of my life, but I feel like unless I get some experience first, my dream marriage would be out of the window. So what more can I do artificially to myself so I can be more fuckable? Read up psychology? More cosmetic surgery? Dating tutorials?

My partner is frequently overwhelmed and I don't know how to help,"Apologies for the word vomit

My GF (26; AuDHD) and I (29; OCD) have been going through a lot recently that has been built up over about several years of us being together which largely stems from me not supporting her while she really needed me and she then blamed herself/made excuses for me not supporting her. After broaching these feelings with me several months ago, I've been extremely unsure on what to do/how to help because acknowledging/expressing emotions are so foreign to me - that being said, they are equally foreign to her, except she had the strength to bring it up with me, whereas I still really struggle with emotions/feelings and empathising with her.

She is constantly overwhelmed with her job, her family, her health, and me all triggering her. For me being so dismissive of emotions/feelings and finding it so hard to empathise and offer useful support I ask often a lot of questions to get a picture of the situation (primarily offer a solution, rather than comfort); if I don't ask, then I don't understand? But, the relentless question asking is also triggering for her (or the relentless asking of the wrong questions), and after several years of living together, she's sick of giving me instructions on what to do for her/to help her and answers to how she feels for example.

She is so fucking tired of carrying all the incredible amount of trauma and stress and strain of her life that she doesn't have the energy to carry mine as well and tell me what to do to help her, because even if she does and I do it, that's not genuine.

So, I'm at a crossroads. I still don't understand what to do/how to help in so many situations and I feel like if I ask, then that's going to make her feel worse and more triggered and more upset. But if I don't ask and just do something (or nothing..) that I don't *know* will work, and it doesn't, then isn't that worse? &lt;-- The inner dilemma that goes through my mind every day. I'm going to therapy to try to dissect that and understand why I'm like this, which is very helpful, but I need to DO something. I have zero actions because I don't know what to do or how to do it or when to do it.

TL;DR I'm an extremely emotionally dismissive person with severe issues with empathy and compassion for my GF struggling with her trauma/stress/anxiety/mental health. I can't sit on the sidelines telling her that I'm learning about X, but then doing fucking nothing while she collapses in from the weight of her trauma and stress. I LOVE HER SO MUCH, but I overthink everything and just don't know how to help and I feel so fucking awful.",,,,,,,,
me (f20) and this guy (m20) are starting over again after he betrayed me. is it worth it?,"im with a guy and it hasnt been a year since weve been in this long distance set up. i met him online through a friend and he’s super sweet and really genuine, our dynamics are super healthy and we’re always talking about how we feel so intimate even though we’re apart.

these recent months had been challenging. he expressed his doubts about himself if he could do the whole LDR thing, especially this wasnt his preference and it was his first time to try because he really wanted me and he wants to work on something more serious with me, something he hasnt done with anyone before. 

we kept discussing for days how to make it work and then it was revealed he’d been entertaining this girl he used to talk with before me but he explained to me that even since i came into the picture he doesnt have feelings for her, he was never intimate or serious with her too in the first place and he’d been trying to ignore her but the girl had always been insistent with sticking with him. he found it hard to confront her and he even told her lies that he and i were just friends just so she wouldnt freaak out. but when he talked to me about this he assured me he was going to confront her for real and showed me their conversation telling the girl hes sorry he hadnt been honest and that he felt nothing towards her and that he wants to fix things with me and pursue me again. 

now that hes come clean he assures me that he never considered her an option, that he has always been certain with me, and doesnt have these tendencies to entertain others, there was just something that was left unresolved with the girl that he couldnt confront. 

i can tell how his attention has always been with me, but he clearly had issues with the accountability with the girl before telling me. 

we both plan on starting over for real and for him to pursue me with real commitment. i believe him because thats how much security hes given to me during those months. i believe this because i know making an LDR work for the first time is hard. 

we’re currently taking a few days off so i can process this and that he can have time to reevaluate and then we’d start again.

of course i am deeply hurt. so angry. he managed to keep her from me behind my back all those months. this is the only and one time he hurt me. but im giving this a second chance because he’s apologized sincerely and we both can see that this is worth it. because i believe him. our next goal is to make a game plan on how to make this endgame and he’s more than down to do it. he says he will prove to me over and over that he wont put this second chance to waste. im not one to trust easily, which is why i want to believe i’m doing a valid thing. 

ive never been happier with anyone else, and it’s a relief to me to know he meant everything he did and said to me…

but is this okay?

TL;DR: he betrayed my trust, but he is trying his best right now to assure me he will help me heal through this to start new.",,,,,,,,
[M30] need perspective on being scared [F30] will break things off,"I've been dating a lovely American lady for a couple of months and we've really fallen for each other. I was/(am?) going to meet her one month from now, flight and hotel already booked, we were both looking forward to it. I knew about her anxiety before, she talked to me about it, had her doubts before that she could never get on a plane to see me because of some issue inside her ear that can, at a very low percentage, get worse when flying. I reassured her, telling her it's okay for me to fly to her first and to see how things go; that seemed to calm her, she admitted it being an irrational fear of hers and wanting to talk to her therapist about it; at a later point she mentioned she was required to do a trip from work to either India or Germany (I heavily favoured the second as I'm close and would be able to visit her with relative ease by train), and the way she talked about it let me think she was being positive about tackling her flight anxiety and also reassured by me.

Last Sunday, she had a migraine while we were video chatting. I know migraines from experience, so I gave her space of course and checked in with her the next couple of days to see if she was still in pain etc. She was being very distant (she's working horrible hours at the moment, so I was kind of getting used to that, but even with that in mind, very distant), I put it to the migraine and she said she's going through a rough patch with her migraine. I thought she was still in pain. The next day, she said it really scared her that she wasn't able to see when the migraine hit her (something I also know from experience). It got to me that I only got like two messages a day that seemed avoidant to me; so I asked her about it and she told me she needed space to think about 'everything' which of course scared me immensely. She talked about how her migraine made her realize how 'fragile' her body was, that she has anxiety regarding her body (when I asked what she meant by that, she said she doesn't want to talk about it), that she doesn't want to be a burden, that she doesn't know how she'll ever be able to get on a plane or a boat (we've been talking travelling by boat if she can't fly, but she said she'd been on a cruise in the past), that she needed space to think about 'my life and how I'm alone here' (she's been living alone for a couple of weeks after having moved out from her roommates; prior, she had been scared of living alone because she got attack by a home intruder once in the past; her family lives in another state). 

All of that really, really frightened me and I'm not really good with having to wait for days for someone to message me, but I saw that there was nothing else to do. I also read a few posts on here about dealing with a loved one's anxiety, that giving space is really important in that situations and that kind of helped, but I'm still worried she'll end everything. I prepared a little text I sent her (with her permission) where I tried to reassure her about everything, that I don't see her as a burden at all, that she means the world to me and that the most important thing to me is to be with her and that I won't let her alone, that I'm at her side and she doesn't need to deal with it on her own.

Now, I kind of need some advice on how to deal with the situation, maybe from people who have experience with that kind of anxiety. I really don't want it to end because of that, I really love her to bits and now, short of finally being able to hold her in my arms, she's slipping away and it feels like the end of the world to me :( Please help!

TL;DR: The woman I love needs space to think about ‘everything’ because of her anxiety and I fear she won’t want to continue with me; need perspective of people with experience in that regard.",,,,,,,,

My (31F) boyfriend (34M) is going to live somewhere he hates just for me,"My (31F) boyfriend (34M) and I have been together for over 5 years. We are met in grad school in North America and are now expats living in two different European countries. Being long distance has been a challenge that we have worked through together. Most recently we have been working on his jealousy (previous post on my profile) which we now more openly discuss and has helped our relationship. 

We are both at the stage of our careers where we are rather nomadic and take on short term (average of about 2 years) contracts dependent on where there is project funding. If you're not in academic research, this slilely sounds insane that two people in their 30s don't have permanent careers yet but I can assure that this is a normal part of our career progression and development and I am not interested in receiving criticisms on this aspect of our lives. 

My boyfriend has always been much more worldly and cultures than I am. He grew up getting to go on trips to Europe, he is fluent in three languages and has a basic proficiency in two additional ones, and he has spent extended periods living in different countries as a result of exchange programs. Compared to me, I grew up and lived in one city until I was 30, I only speak 1 language and I did not leave my home country until I internationally relocated to the UK for work. 

I have enjoyed living in the UK and would consider staying permanently but my partner really dislikes the lifestyle there. Ever since we met he talked about his dream to live in Germany (and has lived there for good chunks of time throughout his adult life) and how excited he was for me to see and experience life in Germany because he was convinced that I would also love it there.

Recently for work, I was living in Germany for the past 8 weeks. And I just did no't enjoy it. I found myself struggling with the cultural differences. I felt extremely isolated and depressed because I could not understand the language (I know the same thing can be said for non English speakers in English speaking countries and this has given me a new perspective on how hard this can be) . Throughout my time there I kept expressing this to my boyfriend and he kept insisting that I just needed time and that eventually I would love it as much as him. But I don't. I really don't. And I really don't want to be in a country where i would feel so isolated and dependent on my boyfriend for everything in life in a foreign country. 

We had a more serious conversation about our future geographical location and I can't help but feel selfish. I told him that I think I am interested in living in the UK permanently. He commented how he really does not like the UK and never wanted to live there permanently. Again he expressed how he always wanted to live in Germany. After discussing if we were happy together in our relationship (we both agreed we are), he said that ""Even though I despise the idea of living in the UK and would rather live in any other country, if that's what it means to be with you then fine"".

I feel bad that he might be miserable in his living conditions just because of my preferences. But I also feel like we're at a stand still where there is just potential geographical incompatibility. Am I being selfish if I let him give up his dream of living in Germany to live where I want to live? Am I selfish for not being willing to do the same thing for him? Is this not my place to judge what he wants to do?

TLDR - my boyfriend has always wanted to live permanently in Germany. After being there for work, I just do not like it and would prefer to stay in the UK. He hates the UK but agrees that he would move there if that's what it takes for us to be together. Should I let him throw away his dreams just for me or should I end things (despite loving and caring about him) to allow him to seek out the life he dreamed of that I can't give him?",,,,,,,,

Hi, so i've been on a couple of dates with this guy and been talking for a month. We are both 32 years old. He has an exwife and a kid which doesn't bother me in the slightist. I have emotional baggage that ive been honest about just not specifics.

I am in therapy to deal with my issues which he knows about. 

Most people are telling me not to disclose anything yet but we are early 30s so im like its not like we are messing around ya know? We want to be open and honest.

tl:dr
When do i disclose things that could be important in a potential relationship?",,,,,,,,
Girlfriend (24f) making negative comments when I (25m) mention my promotion at work,"I started a new job around 7-8 months ago. I have to sit a lot of exams for this job after certain exams and as long as job performance is good you get a promotion and a good pay rise. Because of previous experience I can skip a few of the exams and because my performance is better than expected I will be getting the promotion earlier than expected. Initially it was supposed to be November at the earliest but because of the reasons I mentioned, my manager said it is likely o be April.

I was excited but got informed by the head of my department that it would likely be July-August instead. I was still happy since it was earlier that initially expected. I mentioned this to my gf and said it's slightly annoying since I was looking forward to it being next month and her response was just ""Some people won't be getting promotions at all. I wont be getting a pay rise anytime soon"". I asked her what that has to do with my promotion and the work I have put in to get it? I asked why, just because other people weren't getting promotions it meant I couldn't be excited about mine and slightly disappointed at it getting moved back a couple of months. 

She just said I'm being entitled complaining about not getting more money sooner when people are on less than me. I asked why she couldn't just be pleased for me and she mentioned again that I knew she wouldn't be getting a promotion this year. The thing is, that's because she's currently working part time while at uni and is starting a full time job in September. I mentioned again that that doesn't take away from my achievements and I expected m partner to be happy for me instead of putting me down. She said I'm refusing to see where she's coming from. Does anyone have any advice?

Parents don’t approve of guy I’m seeing,"I (21F) have been seeing this guy (26M) for a few months now where we met at work. He seemed like a nice guy and we started talking from there. The only issue I had was his drinking problem.

I told my parents about him and apparently they already heard through mutuals negative things about him. Such as being kicked out from home, girls, smoking, alcoholic, college dropout. I didn’t know about the first few. 

I really like this guy and he’s been very nice to me. Some of them may be things he’s done in his past. He’s back in college whereas I already finished uni and am pursuing further. I’d like to ask this guy but I really don’t know where to go from here. I love my parents and know they are concerned and want the best for me. Please help

Disappointed in this situation with my bf (25M) but unsure if I (24F) am being unfair,"My bf of a little over a year told me yesterday afternoon that he has no interest in attending my grad school graduation. We went to the same grad school and he said he’s basically been there done that and isn’t interested in doing it again when I graduate. After he told me I got really quiet and we spent the rest of the day in an awkward silence. 

Throughout the day though it seemed to be that he wasn’t expecting my sad reaction and was a bit annoyed by it. This made me even sadder because ever since my last semester started I have made it pretty clear how important this day is to me. My high school graduation was very lackluster and I graduated undergrad during the pandemic so I’ve been treating this graduation as THE ONE (I’ve planned everything out in an excel sheet lol). He’s also aware of how sad I am already that my father will not be in attendance as we no longer speak and my brother also can’t come but didn’t elaborate  why. I spent a week crying over the news and disappointment and he knows that so I’m not sure what reaction he thought I would have.

when we went to bed last night things were still a little chilly and distanced between us. He fell asleep but I couldn’t so I went to the store to get some sleep aid and speak to my sister. He texted me asking where I was and I told him. When I came back to bed he hugged me which I thought was very nice until he started initiating sex. I don’t know what about the situation or my vibe made it seem like I wanted to have sex but I really didn’t and him initiating contact for the first time all day only to have sex made me so unbelievably sad. He said he initiated because he wanted to do it and wanted to make me happy. I just really wanted a hug. After I told him I wasn’t in the mood he pulled back, turned the other way and went to sleep. 

I feel bad for being upset about this because he is a great guy and a great boyfriend the majority of the time but I also feel like he completely misread the room and I feel hurt. I don’t want him to reconsider coming to my graduation since I already know he doesn’t want to be there and that hurts me too.

TL;DR: my bf of over a year told me he had no interest in coming to my graduation then initiated sex while I was still actively sad",,,,,,,,
Not sure what I’m doing with this girl anymore,"I’m 26M she’s 24. We’ve been dating for like a month now but it’s been very casual. It’s just been sex and fun and going out for drinks etc. 

I’ve asked her before what she’s looking for and she said she doesn’t know. Said she isn’t sure if she can do anything too serious. But isn’t sure what she wants and likes seeing me. 

I’m potentially moving 2 hours away in November. So that has made me question if I could have anything serious with anyone right now. 

But I also feel quite uncomfortable in this grey area. After this much sex and time together, I’d usually be thinking about asking them to be my gf. But right now I’m not sure. I find it really weird just not knowing if this is going anywhere and sometimes it feels like it isn’t. 

But I also feel weird saying we’re just wasting time together. 

Not sure what to do 

Tl;dr don’t know where I’m headed with this girl",,,,,,,,
HELP ME (M32) &amp, (F28),"Hello Everyone,

I hope yall are well. I am new to this subreddit &amp; I am hoping I’m at the right place for the answers.

Im (M32) n I have got an immense crush on this lady (F28) from work. We barely spoke however she recently may have discovered that I am interested in her, every opportunity I got I tried to make eye contact. 

Fast forward - 

Few days ago I got a positive response, she looked at me grinned &amp; nodded as if she wanted to be friends with me as well.


I sent her add request on Instagram later that day &amp; she did accepted it.

To open a conversation I pinged her next day ( I asked ‘How she was doing today’)she saw my message but never got a response.

1) I stopped texting her since I don’t want to look too needy.

2) Maybe I’m just over thinking this.

3) Maybe she is caught up with something and needs more time.


What are your thoughts would appreciate your response.

TLDR : My crush probably likes me back but haven’t replied to my message for last 24hrs. How do I deal with this.

FYI - This is the first ever text I’d sent.",,,,,,,
An engaged woman (f27) kept asking my (f27) boyfriend (m31) to dance at a wedding.,"My boyfriend never danced with her, but around the 5th time she asked, he said “there will be plenty of opportunities for us to go swing dancing.” This was his version of shutting it down. This woman and him made out together 5 years ago and have been Facebook friends. She was also clearly neglecting her fiancé all night to talk to us. At the end of the night, around 1am, she texted my boyfriend “so good to see you tonight!”

My boyfriend showed me right away and promised not to text her back (he promised, I did not ask him to do this), but the next day, he texted her back and said, “good to see you and your fiancé too.”

I’m furious. I think he should have shut her down a lot harder the second time she asked him to dance, and I feel completely betrayed that he texted her back. At my request, he unfriended her on Facebook, but during the conversation, I also found out he lied about the number of sexual partners he’s had (30-50 instead of 20-30). I feel like he needs to build back trust but he thinks I’m overreacting a lot. Am I?

TL;DR an engaged woman who made out with my boyfriend 5 years ago kept asking my boyfriend to dance, and he didn’t shut it down the way I thought he would.",,,,,,,,
"Things didn't work out between me (23m) and my friend (23f), would it be wise to ask her to be friends with benefits?","I've known this girl for 5 months, and I was attracted to her from the get go. We quickly became good friends and my feelings for her were very clear, and she started giving me mixed signals, we saw each other every day and we were very physical, as far as regular friendships go. A month ago we went out for drinks and I made my attraction clear, but she said she was confused. She said she didn't know if she wanted to be commited into a relationship, and when she asked me if, by chance, I would accept to be into a sexual relationship while still being friends I told her not, because I saw her in another way and I wanted us to be serious. I told her I would wait for her to understand her feelings and that we would still be friends meanwhile.

In the two weeks that followed the tension between us became so obvious that it was painful at times. I needed to stop myself from trying to kiss her when we were constantly flirting and cuddling, because I had told her I would wait for her. Then two weeks ago I just had to ask her if she was still confused. She was. She said she ""knew she would regret it"" (rejecting me) but she was so confused and she had lots of fears of not being understood coming from her past relationships, even though she knew I was so different from her past boyfriends, and she basically said it was over. When we said goodbye she started crying, when I asked her if she was ok she turned and left me there. It didn't feel right.

We didn't see or hear from each other for three days and I was feeling miserable, until I asked her to talk, and she basically told me she had missed me and she decided to give it a try and see how it went. We kissed and for the next three days we would see each other, and it was nice (we just made out btw), but I quickly realized, I don't know why, but I didn't have those feelings for her anymore. Just when I started worrying about hurting her by telling her, she became really distant and a week later she told me she couldn't see me as a boyfriend, and we ""broke up"". I told her how I felt too and we stayed friends. We still see each other frequently, but even though the physicality between us is no more I am still very attracted to her sexually and from her looks I think she's too. 

At this point after everything that's happened I think just asking if she wants a sexual relationship without commitment couldn't hurt our friendship, but I don't know if our past could come biting us in the ass. I don't want a serious thing right now, but I think I might be the confused one now (which is weird because I usually know what I want). What to you think?

TL;DR me and my friend started a relationship that lasted 1 week after months of going back and forth. Neither of us wants a serious thing, but we're still in very good terms and she talked about being friends with benefits two weeks before we got together, should I ask her if she wants that even if we have been romantically involved, albeit for a very short time?",,,,,,,,
I (31f) left my husband (42m) of 10 years and am still grieving.,"I left my husband over a year ago, it was a decision that did not come easy. It was something I knew I needed and wanted to do, in order to grow personally. I loved ( and still do in ways) him, as a person, I loved the companionship. But it was just not for me and I had known for so long, between the age difference and his lack of ambition to do more in his life, among many other things... I knew I had to make that change, but the pain I feel myself for hurting him still weighs heavy. It is hard not to remember that there were so many good times, as much as there were awful times and for a good portion of the first 5 years i was treated terribly. I feel like i blindsided him, and its hard to forgive myself. I don't want to go backwards, and I don't want the life I had before back. But I am wondering if anyone has been in this position before?

TL;DR why do I feel do much guilt for choosing myself, and why even over a year later do I still get overcome with emotions and sadness over it at times? It is not constant, but it does come back and bite me hard. It's like a death has happened and i am mourning.",,,,,,,,
"My (25M) girlfriend (24F) Slept in a bed with a man friend, and there's a suggestive video.","I've been with my girlfriend for a year. 1 month into our relationship she went on vacation with her and 3 friends. 1 Female that had a boyfriend at home, 1 single girlfriend, and 1 single male friend. They all shared a single room with 2 beds. My girlfriend slept in the same bed as the male. I suggested that the 2 women in relationships sleep together, and the 2 singles sleep together. I found out that my girlfriend slept in the bed with the male, and the other 2 women slept in the other bed. I found that simply disrespectful even if my girlfriend and this man have known each other for around 10 years. To add to that, there was a video posted publicly on snapchat of the man provocatively thrusting behind my girlfriend, then bending her over the bed,  jumping on top of her and pretending to ""do the act"" from behind. 

When I brought it up that it bothered me, she disregarded my feelings telling me to get over it. And as the classic saying goes, ""He's basically gay"" (His last relationship was with a woman). After trying to bring it up over and over again for months, 6 months later, I finally got a ""I'm Sorry, It shouldn't have happened. I feel betrayed, hurt, and my feelings completely shut down/disregarded. I still see this man, and neither him, nor any of the other 3 in the room have told me anything.

21M - I'm done trying for now,"I'm done trying to put myself out there. I'm fully aware that my sex appeal isn't ideal at the moment and that's ok. I don't plan on attempting to date or even hookup until I'm fully confident in my body. Recently started hitting the gym with the boys and eating clean, I feel amazing. Talking to girls at the moment is only killing my confidence. I'm tired of chasing and want to be chased. I know I'll reach my body goals eventually I just wish I was able to reach my goal faster :(

I love my boyfriend,"I M18 am with my M18 boyfriend, we’ve been together for 7 months now. We met our first semester of college and we had already established that we liked each other within the first 3 weeks of school(give or take). Anyway, as we got to know one another I couldn’t help but get this feeling, like it was an intense more than “like” feeling. A feeling that I don’t get with anyone else i’ve liked before. Within the month of knowing him I was already starting to think that I loved him. I’ve never been in a relationship before but I knew that I for sure loved him. I still do, and I’ve even told him how I’ve felt, i always tell him how I feel when I’m around him. They’ll be times like this where these feelings of love are elevated and I just don’t know what to do to express these emotions, especially when I’m not around him. When I can’t just scoop him up to hug or kiss him, tickle him all over, or just lay in bed together. He makes me so happy y’all and I can’t even put it into words. So I figured I’d hop on Reddit and share what I was feeling, maybe others can relate.

What are you supposed to feel when you kiss someone you’re attracted to?,"I (45F) have only kissed 3 people in a romantic sense. None of the people I’ve kissed romantically have produced the feelings I thought I’d feel when kissed. 

When I was in 6th grade, I was kissed on the lips by a boy I had a crush on but the only thing that made it feel special was the fact that it was my first kiss.

In middle school I had a boyfriend who liked to kiss, but I never felt any of the things you read about in the teen novels around that age, the giddy feeling, sparks and fireworks.

As an adult, I’ve kissed my husband but have also never felt the tingle, euphoria or the lust other women have described you’re supposed to feel when you kiss someone you’re attracted to.

I feel like there’s something wrong with me for not feeling anything other than lips pressing against another person’s lips.

not sure what i (19f) should do about the plans i have to visit my friend (19f) this weekend,"Basically a while back i (19f) made plans to visit my friend (19f) at another school for the weekend with other friends. But last week she did something that really pissed me off. I won’t get into the details because the context of the situation is too complicated to explain online. But basically I’ve been annoyed and she doesn’t even know that I am and i haven’t cancelled yet. I’ve been putting it off because a part of me feels like it might be a good idea to bring it up to her face to face. And I’m not sure how soon the next opportunity to see her in person will be, if I don’t go this weekend. Which would mean if I don’t see her &amp; have a convo with her this weekend, i could be holding onto this for a while. Unless I did it over the phone or texted her. But at the same time I’m not sure if anything would be resolved if i did have that convo with her. and if it goes badly it would ruin the weekend for our other friends and just be awkward. And my issue with her is kind of a longstanding problem about her taking me for granted and being inconsiderate so distancing myself might be good for me. So yeah I can’t decide if any good would come out of going with my other friends to visit her or if it’s a bad idea. How should I go about resolving this situation with her?

TL;DR: made plans a while back to visit a friend this weekend with other friends. but she did something that pissed me off last week (she isn’t aware im pissed though) so i don’t really want to see her. but ive been putting off cancelling because i feel like it might be a good idea to see her face to face to work it out. but that also could end badly so im not sure what to do",,,,,,,,
Anyone else deal with emotionally unavailable men?🥲,"TL;DR: Should I continue to wait for him or is he never going to want a relationship?

Long story, so I (27 Female) have been recently talking to a guy (25 Male) for about 3-4 months now. He lives many states away from me and we have never met in person. When we first started talking it was a lot of getting to know each other and the spark for one another was definitely there. Such as he would even send me morning &amp; goodnight texts. Everything was going great for the first couple months, we even spoke about the idea of meeting up sometime in August. He agreed and said would take time off of work (voluntarily offered) and show me around. I was like great. 

I occasionally travel for work and coincidentally my job wanted me to travel out to his state. When I brought it up in conversation I would be traveling for work and possibly staying the weekend. He immediately freaked out &amp; said he was not ready to meet for XYZ reasons and proceeded to tell me he needs more time &amp; yeah. I was understanding and said its okay &amp; that I wasnt expecting to put that type of pressure on him (even though I never mentioned at all that he should see me during that trip).

After that we didn’t speak for a few days &amp; the way we texted changed and instead of making convo’s through text he send reels through IG to make small convo and thats as far as we get. Occasionally I have a side hustle which lets me have more privacy then at home. We will call each other and speak for hours at a time 3-6 hours and just recently started face timing each other and talk on phone or FT till we fall asleep.

**Getting to know him has sure been a ride I was not ready for, but yet there is something about him that fascinates me. He is smart, hilarious, pure, sings, sweet and at times a big mush but man does he put on a tough exterior for everyone else. He has had previous bad relationships &amp; last time he was in one was 2.5 years ago, he always asks for my opinions, says things that he questions himself about after “i said that? Thats unlike me”, my take is he is emotionally unavailable due to his history, although he says he would rather stay away from love and is scared of loving someone and that the idea of love fades away with time no matter who you are and getting hurt. He has closed himself off to the idea of being in a relationship but then he does things like Facetime me when he’s at work, talking to me till his battery dies with no charger while having 6-8 hours left in his shift which completely catches me off guard when he does stuff like this.

Me being me, my ass overthinks. But it’s almost as if I am slowly growing on him and he doesn’t know it or maybe he does and he’s guarding his feelings. I don’t pressure, I’m patient, and let him be the free spirit he is since Im aware he likes his independence and freedom. I have feelings for him but if I tell him my suspicion is he will run. Help, thoughts!? Am I crazy for thinking he wants something more and that I should wait for him.",,,,,,,,
I (21f) feel sexually not enough for my bf (25m) and it makes me sad,"I feel like I’m going fucking crazy, so hear me out. My bf and I have sex every day and often multiple times a day. I always thought I satisfy him enough. But almost every time I leave the house (for like an hour) before he goes to work or I come back, he still needs to masturbate/watch porn. He also asks beforehand when I will leave. It seems to me like he’s just waiting till I leave although I always ask him if he still needs something sexually and he says 'No it would hurt but thank you’. It would probably not bother me like that if he wouldn’t leave his fucking tissues all around his entire room. It’s a very distinguished smell so I smell it directly if I enter his room or when I pick them up to throw them away. If I ask him why he says they’re old (they are literally wet). I know he watches porn and we already had several fights that left me feel insecure although I was okay with it in the beginning and watched some even. But looking into the industry I’m very disgusted by it and can’t enjoy it. What most shocked me were the several child r cases and revenge porn, so I don’t really understand why people still watch and support it. Nevertheless, I said it was okay if it happens in a discrete way and I don’t now it every time he watches it. But obviously I know because his tissues are everywhere. I read other men opinions on why they are still watching in a happy relationship and the main reasons were: ""My sex drive is higher than hers”(That is not the case), ""If she is away for a long time”(I’m away for an hour AND we had sex beforehand), ""If she’s not in the mood""(Was never the case). When I asked him why he does that he says that all men need variety and that one woman is just not enough. He also said that if porn wouldn’t exist he would probably cheat to get this variety. That fucking blows my mind and makes me feel very insecure and not enough. When I asked if we could just record or own porn he said it would be boring because he needs variety and needs different women when he’s masturbating. When we talked about it he also said he doesn’t save it because that’s what I was afraid of. But recently he had some recorded ones on his desktop very blatantly. I didn’t snoop ( don’t want to hurt myself), there were just there on his front page. So now I know that he actually screenrecords them and saves them in a very secured way I would never get to see because ‘it’s Password protected'. Makes me wonder what crazy shit he watches if it has that big emotional value for him that he needs to collect it and hide it. I also asked if we could recreate whatever it is but he said that’s not possible (it’s not hentai or anime). The porn on his desktop was so normal shit but okay. So now I’m getting incredibly insecure every time I leave the house because why am I still not enough for you? Why do you need other women when you have pics and videos of me/us? What is this crazy kink no one can ever know about?

Tl;DR: Feeling not enough for my bf because of his constant porn consumption",,,,,,,,
I [25 M] am having a dating quandary.,"For the last 6 years of my dating life I have dated with very little thought or preference to religion. I’ve always held the opinion that, as long as my partner let me practice my faith it wouldn’t be an issue. I’ve had quality relationships but continually seem to meet people not ready for long-term commitment (I’ve been either an undergrad or grad student that whole time and dated mostly other students). I’ve been getting frustrated with the apparent lack of commitment and generally just the dating pool. 

A close friend of mine suggested I start to date Catholic girls more purposefully. Honestly the early returns have been great. They generally share similar values and are more ready for the long-term commitment I’m looking for.

However, there has appeared a quandary. Many of these girls are more guarded in respect to sex. I have some kinks that I want a significant other to be open to. But for many of the girls I’ve dated talking about any sex itself is almost taboo. It definitely makes me concerned that my kink won’t be accepted. 

Which leads me to my quandary. Do I return to dating a more general pool (that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with)? Or do continue dating the Catholic girls and hope one of them will just be more accepting? I’m really interested in what you would do with this same problem?

"Partner (M/32) ""chases"" me (F/37)&amp; is turned on, wants sex after/during arguments, distance or if they're ""in trouble""?","TL;DR My partner admitted that he wants sex after we've been fighting or he senses I'm distant, or he is in trouble. 

Anyone experience this?? Advice, thoughts?

I know attachment styles cause push and pull, chasing and retreating, but this is a new one. 

Recently my partner admitted that when he feels a distance between us, or if he feels like he is ""in trouble"" / I'm mad at him, he wants me. 

I've noticed that when I pull away or I'm quieter than usual, he does ""chase"" and messages me more, and that if I act aloof he'll come for me. If I'm affectionate and loving, cuddling or sleeping with him, it seems to turn him off and those are the times we do not usually have sex. 

Has anyone here experienced this also? He is looking into therapy for what he (we) feels may be porn/sex addiction, but I'm wondering if it's also attachment stuff that causes this chasing, which could I imagine be interwoven with the PA stuff. He's told me in the past that he's a chaser, he doesn't know why he does this.",,,,,,,,
I don’t know if this is the right place for this but idk where to go,"TL;DR
Is the risk of pain worth taking a step into the unknown, and how should I do it without ruining a good friendship 

I (17M) have been abused by most of the women in my life excluding my mother and as you can guess that makes relationships very difficult. With that being said there’s this girl (17F) that I’m starting to fall for and I’ve started opening up to her about some of what has happened in my past but I can’t stop thinking that I’m gonna get hurt again. Even tho I know she wouldn’t hurt me on purpose. I just want to know if it’s worth going after her and dealing with the pain if it ends poorly, and if so how should I do it without ruining the friendship we’ve already built",,,,,,,,
Did my (M18) bf of 4 years cheat on me?(F19) And is it worth the risk of a second chance?,"
Is it worth it?

I have had a boyfriend of 4 years. He has always been utterly obsessed and everyone tells me so and how he talks about me when i’m not around. We spend every day together and love each other. He showers me with compliments and is always a text or yell away. Genuinely.

At the end of last year early this year I said I couldn’t do it anymore because I had kept telling him I wanted flowers for valentines and other occasions ect and I felt he didn’t care. He told me he did over and over and blew up my phone asking to do anything so i went to him he started giving me flowers and we were good. Then, he did something crazy, we got in an argument at his mums and he said some personal things about me in front of her and called me crazy and I said he was disrespectful and called it off and moved out of our apartment we had together. 

He was telling me he knew he was wrong immediately after and he is stupid and won’t do that again and will explain to his mum he’s in the wrong not me. I didn’t feel comfortable or believe he actually admitted wrong to his mum. (he hadn’t, it felt he had ruined me and his mums only connection) 

We were hanging out on and off for a week. We started going out places again and it was a relationship to me, he was calling himself my boyfriend out and telling guys hitting on me to back off and he said he wouldn’t know what to do with himself if i left for another guy. 

A week later after seeing him heaps i found out he had had a girl over 4 fn times…… I have never been so hurt in my entire existence the pain of betrayal is so hurtful because she was there just hours before me and then after i’d stay there and go see a friend he’d invite her over again. 

After it came to light I left his apartment we once lived in together and took every last bit of my belongings. The girl told me that he couldn’t get hard the times she came over and it was “barely sex”. But he cheated and made me sleep in the bed they were in together so it hurts. The feeling of betrayal is unmatched. 

The same night he moved out of his own apartment and back into his mums and organised therapy for himself twice a week and stopped smoking told his entire family what he did and cut off all his friends who knew what he did and didn’t stop him. I reached out to him crying asking how he could do this to me and he said “because i’m an insecure person i wanted an ego boost because i thought u were going to find better, im so sorry this isn’t your fault, im doing everything i can do fix this i don’t know why i did this to us i wish i could wake up and it never happened” he repeated similar wordings again and again and answered every question i had about his cheating. 

He says he will complete his therapy and do anything for me and if i still want him when he’s done he will buy us tickets to anywhere in the world to see because “there’s more to life”. And “I don’t want her I thought me and you were done for good and I tried to get over u, but I couldn’t. It was selfish and inexcusable I will get the answers for u why I did this to us I was insecure and stupid I just want to hug u so tight right now.” I told him no obviously but it hurts so bad because I loved him and information online is conflicting because it talks about a cheater in a different light to this circumstance.

I ask, does this sound like the man who would do this again? 
Was it cheating?

TL;DR: He basically cheated more than once on me but is remorseful and he couldn’t get hard for her and is doing everything to try fix it.",,,,,,,,
GF (F27) lied to me (M27) about where she was at,"Have been dating since September. Girlfriend works as a hostess at a popular restaurant in the city. A few days before going skydiving with a handful of coworkers, I found a snowboarding bag that she was fixing for a coworker via hand sowing. She said he had asked months before and since they were skydiving later in the week he had given her the bag. Until discovering this bag for myself on the couch i had never heard this coworkers name in the 6 months that we had lived together. Upon questioning her about him she claimed they were barely friendly w/ each other. Yet, there has his bag. I told her off the rip that I didn’t like her sowing the bag up for this coworker i had never heard of and told her he made me feel insecure for various reasons (He’s older, has a better position in the industry than i do and also is ripped physically - i’m extremely forthcoming and honest lol.) She also informed me that he’d be skydiving with her the next day. The next day she left to go skydiving with about 10 colleagues and had left around 9:25 AM. Her drive up was about 2 hours long and i called her after waking up at  10:45 AM to no answer. I was immediately suspicious because if you’re driving alone in a car you’d obviously pick up. She continued to ignore me (texts, calls, you name it) until 8:50 pm, almost 12 hours later - with a text saying that her and a bunch of her friends were at a female coworkers house just chilling and that she’d be home in an hour or two. Fast forward to 10:15 pm. I get home and the car we share is still not back. I start panicking but realize she might be running a little late and bide my time talking to friends to ease my worsening panic attack. Its now 11:45 and i’m sick to my stomach, she has our car and hasnt picked up a call or text from me the entire day even after diving 13k feet out of a plane. I finally give in and DM one of her coworkers who was skydiving with the group that day, only to find out my girlfriend lied &amp; went to the guys house with two of his best mates to continue hanging. I instantly texted my gf in a rage and suspected infidelity (who wouldn’t?) upon getting home and in the days following gf has admitted to ignoring my texts and calls and making a selfish decision to instead indulge in her own fun then give me peace of mind. She says that there is 0 attraction between said coworker nor his two best-friends. She has cried for days and apologized profusely while claiming that i’m the love of her life and that she’s shameful of it all and it not only has fucked up our home life but her work life because they found out she was ignoring me and has ignited work rumors involving her. Throughout all of this she has been adamant that there was no cheating, flirting, touching, or anything of the like - and that it was simply a selfish mistake to just continue having fun. I have found no incriminating texts or messages. What should I do? Keep in mind she was previously in a 7 year tumultuous/semi-abusive relationship in which she was degraded and controlled. A large part of me believes she didn’t cheat as all the messages i’ve found on her phone corroborate her story and multiple people (unfortunately, all guys) were there. I might be leaving a few details out but i’m head over heels for this girl and im willing to forgive but damn this one hurt yall! She loves spending quality time, has bought us a ps5, pays half the bills and pays her dues most of the time even tho i’m a very generous and accommodating bf. 

Tldr girlfriend lied to me about where she was at a day after i told her that a certain coworker made me feel insecure. Texted her other coworker after being ignored all day and caught her in a lie about where she was at.",,,,,,,,
I think I'm falling for a mutual friend my boyfriend and I are letting stay with us (28F&amp,31M) (34F),"My feelings are all over the place and I feel guilty as hell...

So to start off, my boyfriend(J) and I have been dating for about 6 months. I know that doesn't seem long, but we've known each other for several years. We actually met through our mutual friend (M). We were both looking for a new place to live, and decided it worked out best this way. He was dating another girl at the time, but they broke up months later. My dating life has been very uneventful until I started dating J. I've always wanted a relationship, I just never found the right person.

Eventually, J and I found we were both single at the same time. We had a few common interests, and we went from there. It was easy since we were already living together. J and I get along great.

Cut to 3 weeks ago, M asked if she could stay with us. She's a single friend, probably my nest female friend I've known since even before J. Turns out her landlord was evicting her roommates (who refused to take care of their place) and the whole rental agreement went up in smoke. So she needed a hand getting on her feet. I asked J, and he was happy to help. I moved moat of my stuff into his room, and M got my room. This is where the trouble started I guess.

Ever since M started staying with us, J has constantly been going out at night, more than usual. He rarely invites me, and never M. He also tends to be very distant at home, antisocial, and grumpy most days. So M and I hang out most of the day together. We've gotten to the point now where we stay up late and watch movies most nights, or binge Netflix and have some drinks. Other times I'll visit her in my old room and just chat.

She's giving me attention, asking me how my day is... I'm really enjoying my time with her. She's nice, she's gorgeous, and we have a lot in common. I've just never been in such an intimate living situation with her before, and I may be starting to see things in her I didn't before.

Am I wrong here? I feel guilty.

tldr: falling for female roommate...not sure if boyfriend is the cause",,,,,,,
Why do I feel like my friend is avoiding hanging out with me.,"So I'm a 17(M) and I think my 17(F) friend is avoiding hanging out with me. Every time I ask to hang out she says no, even when she says she has nothing to do during a large break from school. I might just be insecure or there could be something wrong, can someone help me with this? We have been friends for about half a year now and we have hung out twice, as well as we spend time together in our classes, but she doesn't want to hang out whenever I ask. Now sometimes she is busy, but just today she said she is dreading spring break because she will have nothing to do, but when I asked if she wanted to hang out she said no. Does anyone know what this may mean?

TLDR: I 17(M) am afraid that my 17(F) is avoiding hanging out with me and I don't know why.",,,,,,,,
me (18f) about to get ghosted by 18M,"hi there can anyone send some help... or any tips on how not to be a dry texter? i was in a talking stage with a guy recently and we ran out of things to talk about. after a month or so our convo became us sending each other memes tiktoks and stickers and now it seems like he lost interest in me and sort of starting to ghost me - last seen me and left me on delivered. still he initiates convo occasionally but ignores my replies (he used to reply almost immediately)

tl;dr: need some advice, do i continue this talking stage knowing that there is a high chance of him leaving me eventually or should i just give up now? im hurting so much 😭",,,,,,,,
"My sister (13) wants to live with me (F29), but a teacher almost died at the school she's supposed to go to and I'm a mess who's never had kids before","I moved across the country away from my entire family recently. I offered to let my sister live with me because her grades were really bad from lack of discipline/attention at home, not realizing what I was signing up for. I've been helping her with schoolwork for the last few months, but it basically boiled down to me doing all of her schoolwork for her every day and parenting her over the phone because she wouldn't listen to anyone else in our family.

My feelings really shifted after she yelled at me when I asked her to explain what she learned in one of her classes. She said ""Why do I have to explain it to you? I already did the school work in class?! I don't want to do it!"" and I said ""you failed all of your tests last semester. You got Fs in everything, so I need to make sure you understand what you were taught in class."" This was after I wrote many essays for her, gave her answers to so many assignments she didn't turn in, and helped her cram all night for a test she failed to mention until a day before. I had to reteach everything her teachers taught her AND do her homework for her on top of all of my responsibilities. It was really stressing me out because I had just moved across the country alone when I've never lived on my own before, I had my first mortgage, car payments, quarterly taxes (I'm self employed), expensive tech issues related to my work, declining health (I had an injury last year I'm still recovering from, plus obesity issues), and I struggled all my life with anxiety around doing everyday things which is why it took so long for me to move out on my own.

That incident where the student nearly beat a teacher to death in Florida happened at the high school my sister is supposed to enroll in, so I told my mom (we have different moms) that she may not be safe because of how poorly the staff and police handled that situation. My mom says to let my sister decide because she wants me to take care of my sister. The school in my sister's area has never had a violent incident like that occur, so I know she'll be fine since our other sister graduated from there. My sister will probably still choose to live with me anyway, but besides my personal feelings, I'm not sure if we should let her go to a school where the staff were so slow to help a woman getting her skull bashed in and the police just let the attacker walk off. There's another school in the same country about 20 mins away, but the ratings for that school are worse.

Honestly, reteaching my sister everything and doing her homework for her over the next 4 years while trying to get her to sleep and wake up on time, teach her to practice basic hygiene, buy her whatever she needs, limit her social media/gaming time, cook for her, take her to doctor/dentist appointments, drive her wherever she needs to go, get her to exercise, emotionally support her, etc might not be something I can handle since I can barely do it for myself.

When I offered to take her in, I thought I'd just figure it out and be okay with taking care of someone else's child because I'm childless. I thought I'd be okay with dying alone without ever getting married or having children of my own, but now that I've had more time to consider it, I'm not so sure. I've never been on a date before because of a lot of past trauma/mental health issues, and just being more picky than I deserve to be. So maybe kids aren't in the cards for me, but I'd like to figure that out sooner and later because of the health risks that come with waiting too long.

I'm on the fence since it was my idea in the first place and my sister has shown improvement; it would be good to see her become a happier and productive person. Though I can't help but think about how her family has always shamed me and talk shi.t about me because I was a depressed, unhealthy, unemployed shut in for many years and now that I managed to pull myself out of that dark period of my life, they want me to undo the problems they caused for my sister. She has parents, a grandmother, grandfather, aunts, uncles, older sister and brother at home, yet they've given up on her. They've already managed to establish their own families, so they think it doesn't matter if I focus on someone else's kid instead of figuring out if I want to get married and have kids of my own while I'm still healthy and able to. I realize it was my idea to offer to let her live with me in the first place, but I didn't think too deeply about the situation before making a decision and I kind of regret acting so hastily and being so short sighted. 

On the other hand, I don't expect to meet a guy any time soon because of the decline of relationships. People aren't having kids at they rate they used to anymore and there are a lot of people that don't value marriage anymore. Seeing how apathetic people have become worries me. I also want to lose weight first/improve my appearance and get my life together, so my sister being with me for a year might be okay as long as she respects me and the rules of my home. I'm so torn on this, I don't know what to do.

TLDR: I offered to let my sister move with me across the country, not realizing how much responsibility taking care of someone else's child would be; the school she's supposed to enroll it was on the news recently for an attack on a teacher, and I'm not sure what to do because I'm a mess.",,,,,,,,
Am I (F36) Wasting my Time With This Guy(M40)?,"I’ve (F36) been dating a guy (M40) for 7 months now and I’m really not sure how he feels about me. His behaviour is very confusing and it would be great to have some non-bias insight. Am I wasting my time with this guy? 

CONS 

- He always makes plans last minute or on the day
- The only compliments I get are about my looks. Nothing else. 
- I have no idea how he feels about me. The most I get is ‘I like you’ and ‘I want to see you’ 
- He’s cancelled on me last minute a few times now with some weak excuses 
- He left me waiting for him for hours on an important date because he got drunk and it ended up being too late to do anything 
- After we’re intimate he won’t come near me he said he needs space after and will sit on another sofa
- He works away half the time 
- We only seem to see each other a few hours on days when we can probably do longer
- We were both off work for a week and there was only one day where we could meet up. He said he could only do an hour because he had the gym
- We never go away anywhere 
- Most dates are Netflix and chill but we will go out for the odd meal or cinema now and again 
- He’s not very affectionate 
- He got irritated last time I brought up that I didn’t feel he was making enough effort 

PROS

- He does get me gifts now and again
- When he’s away for work we talk for hours everyday 
- He does always text everyday 
- When I have tried walking away he fights to keep me I have tried this 3 times now 
- I’m on his social media and he’s not secretive with his phone
- He does apologise when he does something wrong 
- He’s introduced me to his kids 
- He does always initiate us getting together or texts first 
- He will spend his Sat nights with me 
- He’s very attractive and funny 

TLDR: my boyfriend’s behaviour is confusing and he doesn’t make me feel secure. Am I wasting my time on him?",,,,,,,,
I (17F) keep overthinking my feelings for my boyfriend (17M) and I'm not sure how to fix that," This isn't that serious, I just need someone to share their opinion on this since I don't feel like talking to my friend about it.  
So I've recently entered a relationship with my boyfriend, I'm pretty sure he's the first person I've ever had romantic feelings for, I've been in other relationships before but I've never took them seriously. I think about him 24/7, but sometimes I can't tell if those feelings are real or if I'm lying to myself, he's also the first person I've genuinely been able to imagine a future with.  
It could just be my anxiety talking though since it's been getting worse recently, I feel like I just need someone to help me come to terms with my feelings so any input is appreciated! :)

"I am the guy best friend, that so many bfs seem to dislike. ask me anything.","TLDR: I am the guy best friend, ask me anything and hopefully I can ease some doubts. 

I (21M) have known my best friend (21F) for 13 plus years, and I know a lot of people won't believe it when I say, yes it is very possible to have a long lasting platonic friendship between a guy and a girl (that are both straight). 

I know a lot of guys don't like the guy best friend and feel threatened by them or maybe feel a bit uncomfortable by how close someone with a strong friendship can be.

But I wanna see if I can maybe help ease some of yalls doubts, of course these are my personal views on certain questions so anything I say will not always apply to everyone.

Ask my anything.",,,,,,,,
What should I (24F) do about the intense pain/jealousy I feel when I think about the fact that my boyfriend (21M) sometimes has sexual thoughts about other women?,"I realize that most people have sexual thoughts about people other than their partners. However, from what I’ve heard/read, men generally seem to have these thoughts frequently when they’re out and about in their day to day life. My boyfriend of six months has confirmed that he also sometimes has thoughts of this nature. He says that he prefers not to and chooses not to stare at attractive strangers or think disrespectfully. 

For some reason, I can’t handle this idea very well. It’s not that I’m worried he’s going to cheat on me - I’m not. It’s specifically an issue with the thoughts themselves. It makes me feel like other women have power in regards to him/our relationship that they don’t have the right to/I don’t want them to have. It brings up years of feelings of inferiority and insecurity in me. When I’m single, in a way I feel powerful and at peace, because I know that many men both taken and single have thoughts about me, but in a relationship I feel powerless because I cannot command the sexual attention of the only man whom I desire the attention of. There’s probably more to it as well. Maybe it’s very immature thinking that’s leading me to have these feelings. I don’t mind if that’s the case - I’m just trying to get to the bottom of it. 

I’d like to clarify that I’m not being hypocritical. I don’t think about other men in a sexual way. 

Honestly, thinking about this today got me so upset that I considered breaking us up. Of course that would probably be a mistake. He is truly the man of my dreams, apart from this very human habit. I feel that I’ve found a unicorn, and I’d be unlikely to find a guy like him again if we did break up and I eventually got over this hangup. He told me that he would fight these thoughts, and I told him that I would try not to think about them any more and that I wouldn’t ask him about them either. Is that the right decision on my end? I’m concerned that it won’t be enough to keep my mind at peace.

TL;DR - I feel disproportionately negative emotions when I think about the fact that my boyfriend at least occasionally has dirty thoughts about other women. I feel that I would regret breaking up with him and choosing a life of celibacy, so how do I handle these feelings in a constructive way? Is trying not to worry about his thoughts enough?",,,,,,,,
"My sister (13) wants to live with me (F29), but a teacher almost died at the school she's supposed to go to and I'm kind of a mess who's never had kids before"," 

My sister lives in the west coast and I live in the east coast. I offered to let my sister live with me because her grades were really bad from lack of discipline/attention at home, not realizing what I was signing up for. I've been helping her with schoolwork for the last few months, but it basically boiled down to me doing all of her schoolwork for her every day and parenting her over the phone because she wouldn't listen to anyone else in our family.

My feelings really shifted after she yelled at me when I asked her to explain what she learned in one of her classes. She said ""Why do I have to explain it to you? I already did the school work in class?! I don't want to do it!"" and I said ""you failed all of your tests last semester. You got Fs in everything, so I need to make sure you understand what you were taught in class."" This was after I wrote many essays for her, gave her answers to so many assignments she didn't turn in, and helped her cram all night for a test she failed to mention until a day before. I had to reteach everything her teachers taught her AND do her homework for her on top of all of my responsibilities. It was really stressing me out because I had just moved across the country alone when I've never lived on my own before, I had my first mortgage, car payments, quarterly taxes (I'm self employed), tech issues (related to my work), declining health (I had an injury last year I'm still recovering from, plus weight issues), and I struggled all my life with anxiety around doing everyday things (which is why it took so long for me to move out on my own).

That incident where the student nearly beat a teacher to death in Florida happened at the high school my sister is supposed to enroll in, so I told my mom (we have different moms) that she may not be safe because of how poorly the staff and police handled that situation. My mom says to let my sister decide because she wants me to take care of my sister.

The school in my sister's area has never had a violent incident like that occur, so I know she'll be fine since our other sister graduated from there. My sister will probably still choose to live with me anyway, but besides my personal feelings, I'm not sure if we should let her go to a school where the staff watched a woman get her skull bashed in before trying to do anything and the police just let the attacker walk off. There's another school in the same country about 20 mins away, but the ratings for that school are worse.

Honestly, reteaching my sister everything and doing her homework for her over the next 4 years while trying to get her to sleep and wake up on time, practice basic hygiene, buy her whatever she needs, limit her social media/gaming time, cook for her, drive her wherever she needs to go, get her to exercise, emotionally support her, etc might not be something I can handle since I can barely do it for myself. When I offered to take her in, I thought I'd just figure it out and be okay with taking care of someone else's child because I'm childless. I thought I'd be okay with dying alone without ever getting married or having children of my own, but now that I've had more time to consider it, I'm not so sure. If I decide to have kids, I'd rather do it sooner than later to mitigate any risks that come with having children at a later age.

I'm on the fence since my sister has shown improvement and it would be good to see her become a happier and productive person, but she has parents, a grandmother, grandfather, aunts, uncles, older sister and brother at home, but yet they can't handle her so they think it doesn't matter if I focus on her instead of figuring out if I want to get married and have kids while I'm still healthy and able to. I realize it was my idea to offer to let her live with me in the first place, but I didn't think too deeply about the situation before making a decision and I kind of regret acting so hastily and being so short sighted.

On the other hand, I don't expect to meet a guy any time soon because I want to lose weight first/improve my appearance and get my life together, so a year with her might be fine. I don't know what to do.

TLDR: I offered to let my sister move with me across the country, not realizing how much responsibility taking care of someone else's child would be; the school she's supposed to enroll it was on the news recently for an attack on a teacher, and I'm not sure what to do because I'm a mess.",,,,,,,,
My (F26) boyfriend (M24) watches ASMR RP videos on YouTube. I don’t know how to feel about it.,"
For context, we’ve lived together for 2 years now and dated since we were teenagers. He’s had depression for a while, but it was mostly manageable. 
But things have been very bad since his best friend (who was like a brother to him and he knew his entire life) died in a car accident 5 months ago. He’s tried to hold it together whenever I’m around for my sake and still hangs out with me and tries to make it seem like nothings changed and that he’s fine, but I can tell he’s low on energy. Aside from doing work and other necessities, he basically just lays in bed whenever I’m not around. Lost interests in his hobbies. I can sometimes hear him crying when the door to our room is closed and he thinks I’m not listening. He’s been seeing a therapist, but the results have been limited.

Well. Recently I found out he’s watching these weird ASMR RP (role play) videos on YouTube. It’s weird and I don’t fully understand it, but basically a YouTuber talks in an RP pretending to be the girlfriend of the viewers in different RP situations and sometimes comforts viewers. At least that’s how he described it. 

They seemed to mostly be targeted for single people though. So I didn’t understand why if he needed that type of comfort he didn’t ask me to provide it to him and instead secretly did this. And when I asked him he told me “I don’t want to bring your mental health down with mine. I don’t want to risk ruining our relationship by being a constant drain. This gives comfort and peace, and numbs the pain without having to lean on you and making you take care of me. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, I should have. But I don’t want to worry or burden you. I want you to enjoy our relationship. Not hate it”.

I don’t know how I should feel. Is this considered unfaithful? Or am I not doing enough that he feels the need to turn to these? Is it wrong for him to listen to these while dating? 
I’m thankful he’s being considerate of my mental health and doesn’t want to be demanding but it also feels like he either doesn’t think I’m enough to help him, maybe isn’t faithful, or I just am actually failing as a girlfriend. Or am I just overthinking everything? 


TLDR: BF listens to these weird girlfriend RP videos on YouTube, I can’t tell if he’s doing something wrong, I’m doing something wrong, or if I’m just overthinking nothing.",,,,,,,,
Am I(25F) overreacting or is he(25M) gaslighting me?,"Am I overreacting or is he being insensitive?

My boyfriend (25 male) and I (25 female) have been dating for six months. I’m an emotional person and I’m having a hard time knowing if I’m the problem or if he’s bringing me down. 

We mainly do what he wants to do. I listen to him ramble about his interests and whistle all the time. I love him and I accept those things about him. The other day we went somewhere I wanted to go to for once. I was excited and I started humming and he said “you’re driving me up a wall right now” because of my humming. It hurt because I listen to him all the time…i started crying. i told him that it hurt my feelings and he told me I was making a mountain out of a molehill. I ended up having to apologize for overreacting and he was now upset at me. 

Now I’ve been feeling on edge. Feeling like I have to keep my feelings to myself…I’m on edge. I feel really alone…like does he actually care about me? Any feeling I have is like this.

My (28F) mother (60F) hates my partner (30M),"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We have our flaws and we both are trying to work towards being better humans and being better for each other. We've had our ups and downs in the relationship, but we are happy together. A few months ago, we got into our biggest argument, which a lot of it could have been avoided if I had less of a negative attitude and if he was willing to control his emotions and give me the space I needed. Instead, things escalated - he screamed at me and he laid his hands on me. I immediately grabbed my stuff and ran to my car so I could be alone. I called my mom, cried, and told her about what happened. My boyfriend realized what he did and recognized that he needed help with his anger and mental health and put himself into therapy immediately. He grew up in a household with two parents who were always fighting and sometimes violent, but he has said himself that he does not want to end up like them. We have a lot of forgiveness in our relationship, as long as we are able to acknowledge our mistakes and make the appropriate changes to be better. 

Ever since that incident, my boyfriend has been actively trying to make changes in his life, including addressing his mental health. It was a wakeup call for him. Although it's only been a few months, I've noticed that he's been much calmer during our disagreements. He's more cognizant of his emotions. He gets less triggered when someone does something dumb on the road. While the situation I was in a few months ago was a very scary and emotional event, I eventually learned to forgive him after a few months of seeing the changes he has made to address his mental health and wellbeing.

My mother, on the other hand, has done a 180 on him. She never liked him since day 1. She hates him because of that one incident a few months ago. Every time I call her, all she can ever talk about is how much she hates him. Pretty sure she's done a full background check on him, but I don't see him as the type of person to have a criminal background or other red flags. I don't feel the desire to call my mom anymore because it never feels productive. She's just going to tell me that I need to leave him, he's a violent person, and he cannot be trusted. I am a strong believer that people can change, and I've seen that he's determined to work towards being a better person. I also don't believe we should define someone solely from their worst moments. My mom refuses to listen to me when I try to say good things about him or how he's doing well with therapy (she doesn't believe in therapy). She hates him so much that she can't even be in the same room as him. She's protective of me, but somehow, I feel like she is trying to control my life. I feel like I have to pick a side. I've told my boyfriend about this, but he's still willing to put up with it.

The way I'm seeing it, having a future with him means that my mom will panic every time they are around each other and they might start arguing/yelling at each other. This isn't ideal for me because I would prefer to be with someone who gets along with my family. If we break up, of course my mom is going to be overjoyed, but I don't know if I would feel the same way. In fact, I wonder if I will learn to resent my mom. But at the same time, I wonder if she her intuition and wisdom are correct and he is not safe to be around, considering she usually has a good track record for reading people.

tldr: Boyfriend and I got into an ugly argument that led to him laying his hands on me. Cried to my mom about it and now, anytime I call my mom, she repeats herself about how much he hated him since day 1 and tells me to break up with him. He recognized his mistake and is now in therapy to help him manage his emotion and mental health.

What are your thoughts on this situation?  Do you think my mom is overreacting?  Or do you think mothers are almost always right and I should follow her intuition?  If I keep this relationship going (eventually marriage), will my boyfriend and mother ever learn to be civil around each other?  Do you believe that people can change for the better?  Does one ""somewhat violent"" incident make you concerned about domestic abuse in the future?",,,,,,,,
"I [18M] cheated on [18F] my girlfriend, I have 7 days to fix it","I told my girlfriend of two years today, on her birthday; not the best of times to tell her I know.

What's your take on older women dating younger guys?,"I am a 45F. I met a guy on tinder about a year ago. I got tinder after my divorce and honestly was just looking for some flings. I matched with a younger guy. He is 23 now. We hung out atleast once a week. It wasn't really 'dating'.. It was mostly just chilling and watching films and talking. Things began to change recently and we both developed feelings. If I am honest with myself; he is long term material except for the age thing. He has some great qualities. I have not had much luck with dating and so I dont want to throw something great away for nothing. He wants to become serious/exclusive. Both of us want to remain childfree so my that aspect of the age gap relationship shouldn't matter alot. I am just not sure how to go from here.

I [30M] Feel Like I’m in a “Stockholm Syndrome”-Like Relationship with My Partner [31F],"Long time reader. Infrequent poster. Not entirely sure if my post is focused on advice or just to get it written down for self reflection later.

I’ve [30M] been in a relationship with a gal [31F] for almost 6 years. And I’ve felt the desire to be out of the relationship for the last 3 years. More or less aligned with COVID and spending more time together in her condo.

For some reason I can’t explain but can somewhat reason through, I can’t find myself able to exit the relationship. Some core issues with our current situation
-	She owns a 2BR condo and I have an apartment around 15 miles away
-	She has a spending problem. She doesn’t understand the concept of savings. Any money left over from her paycheck goes right into clothes. Probably $30k in credit card debt and maybe $500 in her checking at any given point. Rich-poor. Makes a ton of money. Spends more.
-	Related to the spending issue, she has **a lot** of stuff. We doesn’t want me to move in primarily since she’s not interested in figuring out the space question
-	I’ve over her condo a minimum of 5 nights / week. Typically 6 nights. I bring a duffel to live out of. Around the size of a carry on. Since I can only bring so much, I find my *quality* of life diminished. I don’t wear my nice clothes anymore, I only bring a pair of sneakers, I don’t feel like bringing all my shaving stuff, etc.
-	The expectation is I pay for everything. Vacations, take out, random thing at the store she wants.
-	She has 2 dogs from before our relationship. I’m in charge of walking, feeding and taking care of the misc items like brushing, bathing and medicine
-	If we’re not spending time on something she’s interested in, she’s sulking somewhere in the apartment. Read a book? Nope. Boring. Only watch TV shows she likes, etc.

And finally: **Communication is non-existent**. She has no interest in what I have to say if its not interesting to her. No yelling. No fighting. Just silent treatment if something that comes out of my mouth doesn’t work for her. And short of apologizing or waiting a few hours, there’s not much to do to get out of that state.

There’s a bunch I’m leaving out. Specifically the fun we have together. When she’s at her best, things are wonderful. She works decently high up in her company and would be considered a top tier operator.

But the day to day is rough. My typical feeling is that I’m a caretaker for a child. 

Given I have my own apartment, we haven’t commingled our finances and that I’m clearly unhappy, I have no idea why I continue to stay. I know things could and should be better. I know that this has to be some level of emotional manipulation and/or I need to work through stuff. I don’t expect to be able to work things out with her.

But there’s this deep frustration that I know I’ll never get closure. She won’t even tolerate a conversation about ordering take out less. Having an adult conversation about what I need in the relationship? Or explaining that I’m unhappy? Fuck no. She won’t care. She’ll shut down and just open Instagram in silence.

I’ve told myself I’ll just leave tomorrow and not look back. But here I am typing this on a couch in her condo as she scrolls TikTok for the 3rd hour today.

TLDR: Stuck in a relationship with chains of my own making.",,,,,,,,
I (26F) am having sex issues with my (25m) boyfriend and conflicted,"I (26F) am having sex issues with my (25m) boyfriend

Well, we have been together for 7 years and in the beginning used to have sex often, probably a couple times a week. Then all of a sudden, I started to have pain with sex and would turn down my partner pretty often. To the point of where he wouldn’t initiate. We have had multiple talks about it and I always felt guilty. 

Well fast forward, I found him doing his business and felt hurt. I know it’s normal but it shocked me. One night, we tried having sex but I ended up crying because I have that image of him ingrained in my mind and he left to the bathroom to finish. Since then, we’ve talked about it and he said he needs to do it, to get a release. I have now started listening to audio porn and feel very guilty. 
We have talked about sex and I always express I’ve never had an orgasm and it’s very frustrating for me. He told me to explore myself and figure it out. Well, I started listening to audio porn and feel guilt. I don’t know what do. I’ve been to gynecologists and therapists, but still can’t orgasm.

A friend (25F) of mine is currently in an abusive relationship with her husband (25M) and she can't get out,"Hello,

I have a friend who is currently in a very abusive relationship who is many states away from me. She is 25 years old, and her husband is around the same age. They live in a 2 bedroom home, with their one year old daughter. They actually have three children, two of which live with her aunt due to reasons. They’ve been married six years. In that time, both partners separated on several occasions and ultimately got back together. Reasons being, the husband is an abusive, manipulative sociopath who has no desire to contribute to the relationship, aside from causing psychological harm. She has been the victim of constant beratement, which has done both mental, emotional damage and on a few occasions, escalated to physical altercations. Between the two of them, the responsibilities of parenting, living expenses and general upkeep of their rental mostly lie with her. She has a remote job that has allowed her to spend most of her time at home, juggling between being an attentive parent, working and maintaining the house. He does not actively participate in these things, and really only when absolutely necessary. She has shown restraint and has held her tongue and maintained composure through all of this.

Her current situation is a vile one. The abuse she has endured has taken its toll on her overall wellbeing. Unfortunately, she has very little support from her family, who has been fed lies from the husband, painting her as the bad guy. Quite the contrary. She has recorded evidence of these abuses, which range from text messages between her and her husband, as well as video of him screaming and yelling at her. She has shared this with the only real family she has, her aunt, who sadly champions her husband more than her, leaving her with no real escape. Yes, despite being presented with actual proof that her own flesh and blood is being sadistically bullied, she doesn't care.

The husband has threatened suicide should she take any drastic actions, such as moving out on her own with her child, who is far safer in her hands than his.  He is constantly monitoring her every move, eavesdropping on calls, catching glimpses of her texts and more.

The situation gets more complicated. Her aunt has her two other children permanently, and has been visiting the two of them on the regular. However, our friend has made her aunt aware of her plans to leave the situation, get her own place and leave him to figure things out on his own. The aunt was vehemently disapproving and told her that if she followed through with her plan, she would cut her children off from her, barring any visits or seeing them again. The same holds true for the one daughter they do have with them. Her husband and aunt would make it impossible to see her again.

TL;DR: A friend of mine is in a seemingly inescapable abusive relationship with her husband. Children are involved. Suicide and physical violence have been threatened should she take any action. Texts and videos have been recorded. No immediate family support. Feels stuck.

Any and all advice is welcome and very much appreciated.

Thank you for reading!",,,,,,,,
I(25M) love my girlfriend(30FM). A lot. I'm currently staying abroad for 2 months and start to realise I want to stay more. She does not like that at all and I'm not sure what to do.,"Dear Reddit,

At the moment I'm staying abroad to explore nature, different cultures and improve my language skills. I am having a good time doing so to the extend that I feel like I'm genuinely improving myself. 

As a result, I think I'm starting to realise I want to stay more, even though I promised my beloved lady to come back after the months. My girlfriend has been very supportive in me going on this journey even though it is obvious that she is really bumped that I will be away for so long. 

I have invited her to come along and offered to adjust the travel plans in order to be able to go to destinations that she likes as I am not very selective with these things as long as their new and exciting. It would be great to travel together and explore all these things together. 

Instead she has planned in an extra work project and bought new furniture for her apartment, even though she also had plenty of funds before that to go on a journey with me. As a matter of fact, she has much more income than me due to her family and awesome project based career.

This was a bit disappointing for me as in my mind going on such a journey together is pretty much the best thing we could do. We did manage however to make her come over for 10 days wich is great but I was thinking about a journey that is much much longer.

I have always expressed to her that living in different countries, exploring different cultures and improving my proficiency in different languages is my greatest passion and that it is my intention to pursue that for the next few years. She has always said that it's what she loves about me because she really wants to experience these things too.

I get this gut feeling that when push comes to shove, she wouldnt really commit to a long and faraway trip or move to another country for that matyer. She has never said that this is the case, rather the opposite. Yet, this intuitive feeling does remain. 

I have addressed this feeling with her, saying that I am concerned whether our values are aligned in this way and she assured me that she really looks forward to planning our next trip together as well as looking into the matter of moving abroad?

In the end of the day, I promised her to be back after the two months but I feel like that is not what I want. I also have doubts if she is willing to commit to doing such things together at all! I am not sure what I should do at this point. Am I just being impatient? Or should I just stay longer and see what comes out of that? 

Dear Redditors, my apologies for the long post. Would you pleasw be able to give me some advice on this matter? I'm not sure what to do anymore.

TL;DR: I'm staying abroad to explore &amp; improve. I promised my girlfriend to come back after 2 months, but am starting to realise that I want to stay more. I want to go abroad a lot more often as well and she says that she does too but yet I get a gut feeling that she wouldnt when push comes to shove. How should I go at this?",,,,,,,,

Jealous about wife’s past?

Me and my now wife have been married two years and together for 6. I knew about her past(she told me everything) when we first started dating. She’s had sex with 8 guys and done plenty of other stuff with others. Of the eight, 1 was a neighbor down the road from her house. He moved out then another boy (#2) moved in and she began having sex with him. Boy 1 and 2 were friends and boy 1 basically “passed” her on to number 2. She was in 8th grade when she was having sex with boy 1 and he was in 10th. Boy 2 she had sex with him down a path in the woods and then in her car when she started driving. She had sex multiple times with boy 1, 2, 6, and 7. The #3 guy she had sex with she says it was a one time thing but she still had feelings for him. Somehow her best friend started talking to guy 3 and my wife drove her over to his house to “hang out” her words. Her best friend and boy 3 began having sex and boy 3’s cousin (boy 4) was also at the home and supposedly asked her “what you trying to do” and she stated in her own words to me “I was mad she was having sex with a guy I liked so to get back to him I had sex with his cousin”. I will admit I was shocked and she could tell what I was thinking, but I let it go. Fast forward a few months me and my wife are having problems(I was flirting with other girls, being a not good boyfriend basically. Not only do I find out she is taking screenshots of me and her conversations(personal stuff) and sending them to boy 2, but she is doing it while I’m still typing and telling him that I am tripping. She then invited boy 2 to come over to her house. She swears nothing would’ve happened but we both know the truth in that. The same day I find out she is asking MY cousin to hang out and smoke, then she tells him to delete the conversation. So I’m basically having deja vu with bou 3 and 4 at this point. Boy 5(sorry this isn’t in order) was 18 and she was 14 when she snuck him into her room and they had sex. Then a year later she snuck him in again, she only performed oral on him before getting caught by her mom. Police were called and the guy was arrested. Boy 6 was her first, she was 13 and they were boyfriend girlfriend. He took her virginity in a deer stand. They had sex twice before he broke it off. Boy 7 was a “fling” as in it was a boy she went to school with and she would drive to his house, pick him up, and have sex down a dirt road. Boy 8 she says she took her friend to have sex with someone and he was there and also asked her “what you trying to do” and they had sex.  As I said we’ve been married 2 years and together for 6. When she first told me about all the guys she’s been with I lied and told her I’ve had sex multiple times(I was a virgin).  I just told her the truth about this about a week ago and obviously she wasn’t happy.  My question is, how can I stop these thoughts before they ruin our marriage? I also keep thinking about the fact I wasn’t having sex with multiple people before I met her. I’m not trying to praise myself for being a virgin, but I hate myself for not taking the multiple opportunities I had to have sex. I have never thought of sex as just sex, I’ve always thought it was meant to be with someone you love.

My (~30F) mother (~50F) insulted my partners (~30M) career on social media.,"I have always been very close to my mother, she was my idol growing up. We understood each other better than anyone else in the family and this continued into adulthood. I often go to her for advice, I trust her opinion more than most, and it was a deal breaker for a lot of past relationships if they didn't get along with my mom. She worked at a school as a teaching assistance growing up for 15 years until she got hurt when a student jumped on her back during recess. She retired afterwards. 

My partner (referred to as X) is a high school teacher. He works his ass off constantly to be the best teacher they can. I've seen them work themselves into exhaustion with the work they take home, but they love teaching. X's passion to help kids is one of the things I admire the most about them. I on the other hand have never had a passion for work. I work a 9 to 5 that I care very little about, but it offers good pay, plenty of time off, and great benefits.

A few days ago, my mother watched an episode of Jeopardy where one of the contestants was a teacher. Following the episode my mom posted on social media ""OMG this teacher had the worst answers on Jeopardy. These are the people teaching our children. Everything makes so much sense to me now"". Once I saw it, I was immediately appalled. She, X, and I ended up getting into it over social media. A lot of messages were exchanged, but the key points were that while X was an amazing teacher it didn't change the fact that ""good teachers are few and far between"". At the end of it all, she said ""she [My mom] can have her opinion and I can have mine and that being an adult means to understand this"".

I was livid.

Today, after not talking with my mom since then, I texted her saying that she should apologize to my X. That even if she didn't intend to hurt X, she did with her comments. She and I got into it again, with my mom just constantly repeating that this was just her opinion and that it isn't her [my mom] fault if X got offended by what she said. That this was a free country and she [my mom] can have whatever opinion she wants. I didn't know how to respond, so we just said good night and ended the conversation.

I still do not know what to do. I love X passion for teaching. I do not think X will let this go and move on, and I don't want him to. However, I also don't think my mom will ever apologize.  I am extremely disappointed in her and can't see a way to move past this.

#TL;DR

My mom insulted my partners profession on social media and refuses to apologize. I told her she should apologize and she doubled down. I am extremely disappointed in her attitude and how she handled everything.",,,,,,,,
How could I (23F) forgive my mom (54F) and find closure?,"I am a 23 year old When I was 10 and my sister 8, we were on a rhythmic gymnastics team. Our coach, Natasha, was extremely abusive. She was an old Russian woman, and obviously had different teaching methods than those trained in the US. Us girls were pitted against each other on things like looks, weight, and of course, who was the strongest gymnast. Natasha would shout insults at me and humiliate me in front of everyone (one time she asked the team to get into a circle around me and asked me to tell my weight number to everyone, and tell everyone why I became ""plump"") Looking at old pictures, I was actually underweight. Natasha was the one who taught me how to throw up using a spoon in my throat, and one time didn't let me out of the bathroom until I got rid of a rice krispy she saw me eat).

My sister, on the other hand, was the ""Maddie Ziegler"" of the gym. Natasha had a soft spot for her, she was praised a lot. She regularly won her age group at regional competitions, and did hoop routines really well (if you ever did rg, you would know how hard hoop is). I remember Natasha telling me that I CAN be like my sister, if I just work hard, etc. Nobody was there to tell me that I didn't need to be like my sister, I was good enough. Despite all I went through at that gym, I worked as hard as I could, but it was all wasted.

When I was 12, my sister got an offer from another gym, a highly prestigious one, 2 hours away from where we lived. My mom, without even giving me notice that we were quitting, signed both my sister and I out of my original gym, and only my sister continued gymnastics at the new one. After all my hard work, I never got closure. My mom could have at least told me the day before that we were leaving, but decided not to.

And to make it worse, she didn't trust me to say home alone, so every day after school, I would ride with my mom and sister to this new gym, sit in the car for 3 hours while my sister trained, then ride back. We could often come home past 11. Maybe I would be ok with it if my mom and I were somewhat close, but we weren't. On the ride to the gym, she would turn on the radio really loud even though I get sensory overload because I'm on the spectrum.

Parked in a car near the gym, she would scream at me to do my homework. She has beaten me into compliance multiple times before. She had threatened to kick me out when I turned 16 (obviously my dad didn't let that happen). We have gotten into arguments where she has pulled my hair. My mom had no job, and her whole life revolved around being a stage mom to my sister.

**It's been over a decade, and I am back in my parents' house now after graduating college.** My sister is in college herself now, and doesn't do gymnastics anymore, so my mom has more of ... a *life* now. She tries to connect with me but I am not having it. I asked her if she ever regretted what she did, but she just said she was doing what's best for her kids.

Is my ex playing mind games with me?,"\[cross posted on relationships\_advice\]

Hey all! I (25F) go to school with my ex-boyfriend (25M) and we see each other in class 2x per week. We were friends and shared a social circle before we dated for 5 months. 3 of those months were long distance. I was blindsided - he seemed smitten until the very last weeks.

After the breakup, I avoided him. Our social circle divided, so we had no reason to talk. However, we got stuck on transit often, and he made  weird comments. He told me about things that reminded him of me, e.g. cat videos, academic papers, etc. He also initiated deep topics, like family matters and his friends' personal issues, when I kept things light.

This was tolerable until  January. He told me he wanted to give me a book. I was surprised, and he  added that he'd like it back. Brought it to class the next day. It was short and v personalized to my taste, so I read it quickly and texted that it was a great rec. Surprise surprise... he left me on unread.

He later asked for it back, and ""forgot"" he asked. I waited on campus and had to text him to find out he forgot the request that I bring it to  school.

I made a bigger effort to avoid him. 2 months later, we have a ride together. We catch up as  classmates, although he brings up his friends' issues again. In the last 30 seconds, I compliment his painted nails. I note that he'd always  wanted that. Avoiding eye contact, he thanks me, hesitates, and says calmly and smoothly, ""Actually I've been seeing someone recently and they painted them for me.""

I am surprised, but compliment his nails again, and he gets off at his stop. Still no eye contact. I'm left wondering what just happened. Do you think this was innocuous? I doubt I would have found out otherwise. I don't have social media, and he is not open about his dating life... took him 3 months of dating to tell me (without alcohol) about his only ex.

TL;DR my ex told me that he's dating someone when I expressed no interest in finding out.",,,,,,,,
Wanting other girls while on a long relationship,"Hi I’m a 22 a year old male, I’ve been with my girl for 5 years now she’s my high school sweetheart and we’ve both been our first. Over the last 2 years I feel more lust for other girls, especially the last three months have been harder because I just can’t resist flirting with other girls at the gym(and it’s actually going well). I don’t know if I should break up with her since we’ve been together for so long and I love her but I fear if I don’t satisfy this lust now while I’m young it will be worse if I suddenly can’t resist it when we’re married some day… what should I do?

TL;DR: On a long relationship, I want to have sex with other girls, what should I do?",,,,,,,,
i (25F) told my partner (22F) that someone has a crush on me and they got upset,"Someone close to me, recently told me that some random person from a party has a crush on me.

I’ve been in a relationship with my partner for a few years. They were also at the party that night, and it was pretty clear we were together and mostly everyone at the party knew we were together. 

I’d never met this person before but I guess they formed a crush? I didn’t even talk to them, like I said hi when someone introduced us but other than that I didn’t even go near them the rest of the night. Anyway, someone I knew told me about it and I laughed and said that was funny. 

I didn’t think much of it because it’s likely I’ll never see this person again and I’m literally in a long term committed relationship and love my partner.

So I showed my partner the conversation and they got upset about it. Said the person was disrespectful for even talking about it, and saying the person who told me didn’t respect her or our relationship. And that I reacted badly and shouldn’t be laughing about it.

I don’t know, I thought it was just like a harmless funny thing? I also didn’t wanna keep it from them. How should I go about this? Or how should I have reacted to something like this?

"Me (20M) and my now Ex (19F) Broke up because our situations, but we know we still love each other. Should I be hopeful that we can get back together in due time? Or give up.","So before I left for the military My GF and I were very very happy together. We knew the inevitable of me going once I graduated high school, but we agreed to work through things despite the distance. Recently She said that because of school and the pressure from her parents, ( they don't care for me because I'm not Mormon, but shes also not Mormon) that she didn't think that she could be able to handle all of the pressure with the relationship and her schooling. She said that she loved me still but wouldn't be able to talk to me till she gets finished with her degree 2 years from now. She said to hope to contact me after. Should I still have the hope that It happens or should I give up and forget about her? Is there another option?

just want a listening ear about my relationship,"me (18m) and my (17f) gf met each other at a mutual friends house around 7 months ago and hit right off the bat. we became official roughly 3 months ago so this is more of a new relationship. we got extremely close and have even had sleepovers, spent the whole day at each others houses, even go out or see each other almost everyday. we were doing that since before we were official. obviously becoming official opened the door to more things, but i choose not to speak on that for our privacy. so march comes which is our 3rd month being together and her parents found out she wasn’t doing the best in school. so now she’s grounded, no phone at night, no going out, her mom is taking her to school and taking her home. there is no way i can hang out with her and it’s killing me. she’s gotten grounded before and we would usually find slips in between, i would pick her up from school and take her home, i would bring her lunch during her break at work, or drop her off at home from work. but her mom said no more rides from anyone, that she has to call them for a ride, and it might be my own conscious going into a dark place but i feel like lately she’s slowly been getting distant, and i just want it to work. i know everyone says to talk about it, speak your mind, etc., and i understand that’s the truth, i have to communicate to know how she’s really feeling. it’s just sometimes she gives me random reassurance like telling me how grateful she is to have me, or how much i’ve helped her with her life. (she’s been through a lot of personal issues since we’ve gotten together, and i’ve been trying to help anyway i can. as far as letting her use my personal financial accounts, me coming in bad weather just to check on her house outside and etc.) i don’t have any doubt of her love and i do feel like she loves me. i do feel like she cares about me and wants me to be with her, she sometimes just doesn’t show it. now since she’s grounded i can’t text her after a certain time, i can’t see her anymore, and from going out almost daily to not going out cold turkey really had a negative impact on me. we both love each other’s company and have even shared that if we were able to we would want to be around each other all hours of the day. now i understand my relationship is new and we can be in a honeymoon phase or whatnot, but i’m just starting to get a little worried with the fact that there isn’t a date where i will be able to see her again. a previous time that i always think about is when we were going to go out and her mom started asking her who she was going out with, she told me she was too nervous and scared to tell her she’s dating a boy. since she didn’t want to tell her, she had to cancel our date, which really bummed me out. she’s introduced me to her brother, her friends, and she’s told a few of her family members about me. she gives me constant reassurance that she wants me in her life and tells me she really wants me to meet her parents but doesn’t know how bring it up. her mom knows of me, she knows i’m someone who’s been to her high school sports games and she knows i’ve even given her gifts, but my girlfriend is scared to tell her that i’m her boyfriend even though her mom already has an idea. a good amount of my family knows about her, my brother has met her, and my uncle has met her. i guess what im really asking for is a listening ear

i know this is all over the place and i would like to continue talking about this with you guys

Tl;DR:
i really just wanted to vent, to get things off my chest that’s really been in my head lately. i don’t really have anyone to talk to anymore besides family members, but when it comes to talking about personal issues with family members it’s uncomfortable and it’s not normal for us to. i would love to hear feedback, and maybe some advice with the situation of her being grounded and me not being able to see her or text her after a certain time after seeing her daily for months and texting her from morning til night. and her constantly getting around her mom questioning if she has a boyfriend or not.

i don’t want to speak too much about us since this is a throwaway and i don’t want anyone i know finding out but i can answer more questions you guys have the best i can

and recently my mental health hasn’t been the best i’ve been feeling pretty tired of everything, i’m starting to have issues with some family members and my depression is coming back. but i don’t believe in breaks, i believe i can work things out with balance, just having trouble finding it.",,,,,,,,
What did I do wrong this time?,"tl;dr My close friend of four years contacted me again and was nice for a couple of days, asked me if I was traveling to her part of the world this year and then ghosted me again

Hi all,

I had a huge fight with someone I thought was my close close friend. It's been about 7 months since our fight, and she said she wasn't ready to talk about it the times I tried to reach out, so I didn't press, but I sent a text to ask how she is once a week and get a totally cold reply (or no reply). The thing is, I know I acted poorly, I felt like a doormat and neglected in this friendship for a very long time and lost my shit - which takes a lot for me to be pushed to doing

So, basically, the summary as I wrote a long article and even I was bored reading my words (this is long but the other was a novel):

&amp;#x200B;

* Friend and I met on tinder almost 4 years ago, I was separated at the time, and she didn't seem into me romantically because of this, so I never pursued it.
* Over the course of time, we became extremely close (I thought) and agreed to have the relationship where we shared secrets that we couldn't tell others. (i.e. the reason I was separated was my wife had a long affair with a friend and I couldn't handle it)
* My friend told me her Mom spoke to her and was worried about her being close to me due to my marital situation back then, so I totally backed off
* My friend has lots of random guys she hooks up with, but always said she doesn't like the emotions involved in a relationship, so she prefers brief relationships
* She and I used to send lots of selfies to each other to stay close, as we do not get to see each other due to the pandemic
* It started to be where she would disappear mid conversation, and come back hours later to say goodnight or chat a bit before she slept.
* I got into a car accident on new years eve and sent her a text saying I couldn't call her because of this and she didn't really talk for a few days as she felt I brought bad luck by telling her about my car accident on new year, I had to ask and drag it out of her, as I wasn't sure what I'd done wrong.
* Over the last year, she had gotten mad at me and not talked to me for a week or so a few times before saying she realized she overreacted. I always texted asking what was wrong, and a couple times she said nothing, but one time she sent me a long angry text about all the things wrong I've done and how it made her want to kill herself, because I wrote her a message trying to explain why I sometimes seemed off (I had realized early on I had some jealousy, and had gotten past. it, so wanted to explain why I had reacted or acted poorly sometimes, even though it was in the past, as I had realized it with some self reflection, I just wanted to apologize. I felt awful about upsetting her). Some of them I hadn't realized, but I felt so badly about this message as I thought I was doing the right thing owning up to my shortcomings.
* She was cranky with me a lot earlier last year, and I spoke up about it, and we were ok for a few months. (Like I used to send flowers when I thought she needed cheering up, and one time the delivery guy woke her, even tho I specified deliver at night, and she was so cold, just a thank you, but it was a cold one)
* She had been withdrawing more and more, but still telling me I was the most important one to her, and she loved me and called me sexy and hot a lot, but stopped really confiding in me, but always wanted me to be there whenever she was going to sleep as she liked to chat a bit then each day. I noticed I was getting cranky and short with her, and I tried to adjust myself, as we are just friends. I hated I got that way.
* She hadn't been sending pics at all really, so I pathetically asked for one on my birthday, and she didn't send for almost a week, but she was sending tons to other guys (which is fine. I am not bothered by guys, just, I guess I wanted to feel special on my day. I. know, I know.)
* I found she hid a two year sexting relationship with a married man, and I was upset because of the hiding/lie (and honestly, she led me to believe we weren’t intimate because I was separated), but I thought we were good as we had a long talk after and just everything seemed great. The man was also the same ethnicity as the married man my wife cheated with, with just sort of hurt deeply, reopening that wound. I really wouldn't have cared, just hated being lied to again.
* After swallowing the lie about the married dude… I have some trauma around people from a certain country, as my father used to lie and take trips with women from this country - but always said he was seeing friends. My friend had said she didn't like them either, so I reacted weirdly when she said she was talking intense and sexual with someone form there on tinder. I regretted my reaction and apologized. She told me no big deal as she wasn't talking to him or seeing him anymore
* She was planning this trip to a place she said she wanted to go with me, as it was special to her, and somewhere special to me (neither of us had visited before). Because we are apart, she recently said she was going with her other close friend, which made me happy as he is very special to her as well. It turned out she was going with the random guy she met on tinder, and the friend was joining only part of the time, and I shouldn't care as she had no feelings for him. I found out a few hours before she was leaving.
* I totally lost my shit, which is rare, and got angry and said some hurtful things because I felt bad about the hiding/lying. I don't get that angry easily or often, so just didn't know how to deal with those emotions and said some mean things. But looking inside, I think I had been feeling neglected or ignored, and then told how special I was all the time, but the actions never matched the words. And boy am I ashamed at the things that came out of my mouth. It was out of line, and I couldn’t believe it was me saying them, it was just pure emotion.
* She told me I made her feel totally guilty of all the things she's done the last few years, and that she didn't even want to go on the trip anymore, that I'd ruined it, she also said all she did was trigger me. I feel so devastated that my anger, and selfishness, ruined her trip and made her feel bad about herself. I never judged her lifestyle, and I never will - everyone does things their own way
* I texted a week after saying I knew we both were hurt, and that she needed space, and I wasn't being silent to be a jerk, just trying to respect what I felt she wanted. I got a cold response of two words
* I tried to other times to ask how she's doing and got cold response/silence, except for one time she chatted me like everything was normal in November and then ghosted me again

&amp;#x200B;

* Fast forward to a couple weeks back, I finally had moved on but she sent some nice warm messages, and I foolishly responded, only to have her ghost me again

&amp;#x200B;

* She’s still with the guy she met last summer, I’m pretty sure - which is actually great, I always hated she jumped from man to man, always felt she deserved better (and no, I didn't think that person was me)

I've been doing a lot of self analysis since then, even going back to therapy, as I just am devastated and can't sleep, or eat. I still miss her, but I understand the shitty things I said were in the wrong. I know this friendship is ruined because of me. I normally am very open and direct, but she doesn't like talking about feelings or emotions, so she asked me not to, and I did (but it all built up, I guess).

Also, I know that when I feel someone is slipping away I can grasp too tight. It’s not a good look on anyone… The thing with me is as long as people are honest with me, I don’t panic. It’s the unknown and lies that drive me a bit crazy.

I should add, not that this excuses my outburst, but I had some pretty horrific abuse as child, and I know that it affects the way I am in relationships sometimes (I always want to please, but maybe this makes me toxic. I really don't know)

I just don't want anyone hurt over me ever again. I know I can be weird, and I guess I wanted more than I deserved with my friend, I guess since my wife had hid so much and was never sexual with me… I wanted someone at least who confided in me.

Really... why would someone reach out and act friendly for a few days, ask me if I am coming that way this year... and then when I reply nicely, ghost me and leave me on read again? I don't understand what I did wrong.",,,,,,,,
TL,DR need help," Hello, I need some advice. I (M19) have been talking to 2 different girls in my class. They both seemed interested in me. The first girl we had good convos every class I would talk to her during class. She seemed interested and sat next to me by her own will the 2nd week of school (classes are once a week) and after class, I ended up getting her number after 2 classes, then 2 classes later asked her to hangout. She responded with perhaps, what day you were thinking? I gave a day and she never responded.

 I started talking to another girl in the class the same thing happened, she seemed interested, even came up to me and started a convo with me before class and has sat next to me multiple times, after 4 classes I asked her if she wanted to hangout she said yes, and then said I have to check my schedule. I texted her today, no response. What am I doing wrong? Am i just unlucky?  TL;DR",,,,,,,
debating asking friend to hookup,"TLDR: I think friend and I are both attracted to each other, debating asking to hookup or not

I haven't posted on here ever, nor on reddit in the last while. Regardless, I'm in a kind of weird position suddenly and could use some advice.

Basically. I broke up with my boyfriend this past week, over my college spring break. It was a long time coming, although the relationship itself was like 9 months long. ANYWAYS. So, back at college, I have this friend- let's call him James because that's a very generic name. James and I met when we were both in relationships, which made me kind of ignore the behavior I otherwise would have assumed was flirting. We have a lot in common, including birthdays and appearances which means he sort of looks like my angry Russian cousin.

To add to the list of things we have in common, apparently, is that he also ended a relationship over spring break. These were not correlated events, and I actually had no idea him and his partner were having problems. Anyways, he texts me about this over break, and when we get back on campus, I invite him over to my place because I'm a curious person and needed details. He gives me the rundown, and I sort of give him mine. He then tells me he had a dream we kissed- which is just a really weird thing to tell your friend in my opinion. But admittedly, I'm like, this is a really weird coincidence again because I had a similar dream on the same night. He was just sitting there so I kind of was just like, ""I'm not going to date you,"" which is a very true statement, and I just had to get it out there. He gave an indication that he didn't mean to imply we were going to date, and then we sort of just went to the bookstore and pretended that conversation didn't happen.

It's true I don't have any interest in dating this friend, or at least pursuing any sort of traditional relationship with him, and that's frankly a really bad idea because we both just ended these other relationships. What IS true is that I've always been attracted to him, and maybe that's a narcissistic thing because we look a little alike (which is an important part of the whole problem imo) but it's true, and I can't help but want to see if he's interested in a kind of fwb situation.

Why I'm hesitant to go forward:

\- He'll say no to advances and it will make things weird

\- we hookup and it's bad

\- we hookup and it's good

\- friendship dies

\- i end up dating my evil twin

This is a really annoying situation so any advice would be helpful. And yes I know the best idea is probably to not do anything because there are a lot of reasons not to, but I literally just want to- and I think he also kind of wants to- and if I'm lucky I'll be transferring colleges next year and will never have to see him again. Also I'm an art student so admittedly I do want a weird erotic friendship to draw inspiration from. None of this is ironic, I'm just a really silly person. Thanks again",,,,,,,,
Spending issues,"I’ve been dating a guy for 2 years and we’re a decent couple. Both in our mid 30’s. We love each other but I have a problem. I’m culturally/behaviorally inclined to prefer the guy to spend on me as the woman. Nothing lavish, but occasional dates. He does not like this even though he begrudgingly accepts to take me out sometimes. He likes splitting. We’re in our mid thirties. It feels childish for me to have to debate him over this yet we’ve had this talk and he thinks we should be 50/50 on spending. He makes more than me. His father is also like him. I personally think women more to lose in a relationship, and one way to show commitment is through financial investment. And it’s just more attractive to me than splitting. Am I crazy? What should be my standard here? Please don’t attack me, I simply want to see how to think about this issue in a wise way. I would appreciate your wisdom.

TL;DR! My bf doesn’t like to spend on me and I have a problem with that.",,,,,,,,
Am I a bad person for wanting to step back from this someone who is obviously hurting?,"This post keeps getting deleted and I don't know why. I have reworded it, AGAIN, so I hope it won't be deleted.

I (71F) have a friend (65M) of 40+ years. Over the past 15 years he has become reclusive and a hoarder. He lives 2 hours away, so we communicate through email, texts, and phone calls and have only met F2F about 3 times in the last decade. He has a few medical issues that have, over the past few years gotten more serious and have required a few of surgeries. Because he has drank to excess everyday for years and taken whatever Rx meds he can talk his doctors into prescribing (Xanax, muscle relaxants, etc.) they have contributed to the downward decline of his health. He not only refuses to do anything to get better, he is convinced that he knows better than than his PCP, his cardiologist, and his gastroenterologist and frequently ignores their advice to make the lifestyle changes that could improve his health. We have discussed his plan to ""go permanently"" when he decides he can't take the pain anymore.

I've told him numerous times how his death will be excruciatingly painful for me as he is one of my few remaining friends.  I've tried everything I can think of to encourage him to make positive changes, such as getting out of the house, cutting way down on the alcohol and drugs, and following his doctors' advice. It just pisses him off that I ""lecture"" him and we end our conversations on a sour note.

When I fail to respond quickly enough to his emails, texts, etc. he'll send me something that suggesting he's about to ""do it"" or he'll send me a photo such as the the graphic ones where he has deliberately cut himself!! I am aware that that is manipulative behavior, but, since I care about him, I always call immediately! That usually just turns into me listening to him talk, and talk, but rarely about his serious issues. He just wanted to talk to someone and I'm an easy mark.

\---

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My question is this, ""Should I save myself the constant worry, anxiety, and emotional pain by cutting down, or even off, communication with him?"" Would that make me a bad person? Or should I just ""suck it up"" and keep allowing him to practice the emotional blackmail that has been constant and draining?",,,,,,,,
I 24m asked out 19f but she has a bf apparently,"So basically I liked this girl in my class and I asked her out via text. I didn’t get her facial expression but she kindly told me she has a boyfriend and to not worry about it. 

That was a month ago and we only have our class once a week together. I noticed she actively avoids/ignores me in person. I never approach her but it’s just her body language. For instance, today I was sitting near her and she had her complete back turned towards me as she spoke with a high voice to her friends. I also noticed she started showing up to class more ""dressed-up"" ever since I asked her out. I need advice on what’s going on

help with this issue at hand,"Hello, this is my first time posting here.

Little bit of background,
A few months ago, my (15M) girlfriend (15F) cheated on me, and I was devastated. It shattered me, and I was a wreck, even though I haven't even graduated high school yet. We had been dating for a little over a year, and it really did suck when I found out. Though throughout this time healing period, there was this one girl (15F) who will be referred to as ""C"" from now on. During this period after i found out C had always been there for me and when I needed it I'd just text her and she'd help, now after I've been healed and all if those memories are in a box stuffed in the back of my closet, I realized that I saw C as more than a friend. I feel she is one of the only people I can open up too, she has beautiful blue eyes, her smile is just enough to make anyone happy, and her hair is gorgeous, she  gives me butterflies in my stomach when ever i talk to her, she is the most caring person in the world, and even loves similar things i love to do (ex. Play video games, listen to the same genre of music, etc) Though there are a couple of ""bumps in the road,"" the first being that she is ""talking"" to someone already which I thought after meeting him I would stop loving her, usually after the fact with past crushes I would just stop then and there though only this time it didn't work, I still loved her. The other ""bump"" is the reason she is not dating this guy she's talking too, she was in a very bad relationship last time she was in one, she says she's not ready to date again yet until she finishes fighting her own demons. And now I'm off for spring break and have plans to hang out next week, should I tell her how I feel or should I wait and hope to get lucky and something happens between the guys and her?

TL;DR
My gf cheated on me after the healing period I fell in love with a girl but she's into another guy and she also said that she doesn't want to date currently until she fights her own demons.

my (35m) boyfriend (25f) said i was ugly,"this is not a true story but i was watching my show on tv. it’s called braxton family values. i was wearing my black knee high socks. i said “babe come watch this shit with me”. he was like “no, i’m about to go hang out with the boys.” i was like “babe can we spend more quality time together? we haven’t cuddled and watch tv for months.” he was like “babe, you need to get a hairline transplant because your forehead is huge and it’s starting to look like lebron james hairline”. i said “wtf bae what did i do to make u say some dumb shit like that?” he said “be ugly as fuck. but imma catch you later babe.” then he left. now i’m watching braxton family values alone. any advice?

Am I (22f) being too clingy with my bf (23m) for being a bad texter?,"When we’re together everything’s fine. But ever since I first met him he’s been a terrible texter. Like super dry and like he wants to end the conversation. This has led to so much miscommunication in the past, because he’ll respond super dryly and then I won’t respond and then he’ll get anxious that I’m off doing something bad (this was before we were exclusive). And then when we were again his dry texting and taking super long to reply made me so anxious that he was mad at me so I wouldn’t reply and he would be thjnk im off doing something again. He was openly admitted that’s just how he texts which I understand but i just feel like everybody else I text is a decent texter than him? Im just sad bc whenever I want to tell him things I know I’ll get a dry response vs texting my other friends is supportive and good advice. I’m not even talking like you need to say paragraphs or anything it’s just so dry and uninteresting whenever we’re apart and only texting. It happens so often where I feel like he’s not even into this relationship bc who can text THIS DRYLY especially when we’re in a relationship, but then when he calls or we meet in person everything feels normal. I feel like I’m overreacting a lot though. Thoughts?

Tl;dr my bf is so dry at texting whenever we’re apart it gives me anxiety",,,,,,,,
Cute boy likes me I don't know what to do,"I (16f) was just told a boy I thought was cute likes me (16m). He's SO sweet and genuinely a great person, I personally think he's too good for me. I was tipped off that he liked me last month so him liking me wasn't a surprise, what was a surprise was how fast I feel this is moving. I haven't even had a conversation with this boy, I was thinking he would at least TRY to approach me first y'know flirt a little, maybe ask about the weather or something but no dice. He's not the first boy to like me, but the the first I've (kinda) liked back. What do I do now? We probably said three words to each other this entire school year, there is no prior relationship to build on. I have no idea how to proceed, like I can't just date him but also if I turn him down it'll feel awkward. I like this boy but not that much. I can't go on dates or text since I can't have a phone so just in case how do I navigate a school relationship? How do I enter and maintain a ""talking stage"" with a stranger? I was happy before this.

TL;DR- boy (16m) likes me (16f) but we're basically strangers with no relationship before this.",,,,,,,,
"My (33/M) wife (33/F) and my parents (early 60's M/F) don't get along, and playing the middle man is pushing me to the breaking point.","I apologize if this is coming off as a bit long winded, but I'm at a big crossroads with this issue between my wife and my parents.

For basically the entirety of our time together (5 years married, 9 years together) my wife has disliked my parents. My wife is very sensitive, and can take things very personally/blow things out of proportion. My parents, who are definitely not without blame in this, can be a bit hard to deal with. My Mom is, to be honest, a bit of a narcissist. She's the kind of person that just isn't super warm, and can say things without a filter, and kind of makes things all about herself. To be honest, it's something I've been aware of, but until I met my wife, I never realized what a problem it was. I think that over time, I've just kind of dealt with it, and just wrote off her behavior as ""that's just Mom being Mom,"" but with my wife being so sensitive, I've gotten better at calling my Mom out on her behavior, though I admit I don't do it as much as I should.

Some other important facts that will be relevant later on: My wife and I live about seven hours away from my parents. I have two brothers, both of them live four hours from our parents (but in different cities). My wife's parents live about 20 minutes away from us, and we see them often.

My wife has high anxiety around seeing my parents. Honestly, it's mostly my Mom; she and my wife are just like oil and water, as I kind of touched on earlier. Part of the reason is that my Mom has a history of saying some unkind things to her, and I admittedly wasn't great about standing up for her. It's something that I've gotten better at, but there's still some anxiety on my wife's part. I'd bring up the topic of my parents visiting/us visiting them once every 3-4 month or so, and usually it would start a big fight. I'd say about half of the time, my wife would agree to see them. We kind of came to an agreement when my wife said she only wanted to see them ""a few"" times a year. I agreed, mostly for the sake of keeping the peace, but we'd still get into arguments when I brought up seeing them. My wife and I have talked about putting up boundaries with my parents, which I'm working on, and I think I'm doing an okay job.

Our daughter was born two and-a-half years ago. I had always assumed (perhaps hopefully) that my parents would change their ways when they became Grandparents; I had great relationships with my Grandparents on both sides, and was hoping that our daughter would have the same with my parents.

However, it hasn't been quite like that. While they haven't been unkind, they're not the kind of grandparents I was hoping they'd be. For example, they rarely ask about our daughter unprompted. When we FaceTime them, they'll talk with our daughter for a few minutes, then go offI to talk about their own thing. It always feels like they want to be grandparents, but on terms that work for them. I also think it hasn't helped that my wifes parents, who see our daughter often, are the complete polar opposite of my parents; they're your typical lovey dovey grandparents.

In the first year of our daughters life, my wife had a tough time with PPD. As such, I didn't really push the topic of my parents visiting with her or them. Fortunately, due to Covid, I was able to kind of push off their requests to visit us.

Once Covid kind of let up in the Spring of 2021, they came down to visit us a few times. It was okay. My parents didn't really interact with out daughter like we hoped; they played with her a little, but they just seemed interested in working on their laptops and playing on their phones. My wife and I were both upset as to how that trip went. A few weeks after that, we went to visit them at their house, but we had to leave early because our daughter got sick. When we left, my parents seemed upset with us, and kept saying ""oh, she's not sick, she can stay, she seems fine,"" which bothered my wife and I.

Things then were okay for a few months. We saw my parents a few times, but it was mostly at big events (Weddings, Anniversary Parties) so they didn't have much 1:1 interaction with our daughter. The last time they saw our daughter in person was for her birthday party. It felt like my parents didn't spend as much time with our daughter as they did with our niece (their other granddaughter). While I was a little hurt by it, but didn't say anything to them to keep the peace, my wife was completely disraught.

Since then, things between my parents and my wife haven't been great. They've been acting the same; they'll ask about her intermittently, and do the same thing when we're on FaceTime. They've asked me a few times about coming down to visit, but when I bring it up to my wife, her response is ""no, I don't think they've earned the right to visit."" My wife is of the mind that having a relationship with your grandkids is something that's earned, not given. While I agree to an extent, and I don't think that my parents have earned a free pass on everything, I do think that we could stand to foster a bit more of a relationship with them, but my wife won't have it.

Things have come to a head when my parents have been trying to plan a week long vacation with us, my brothers and their spouses. For some context, my wife and I go to the beach for a week with her family, as do my brothers with their respective in-laws. My parents wanted to also book a vacation house with us, partly because they want to spend time with us, but also, because I think they're jealous.

When I brought it up with my wife, it started a minor fight we ended up compromising that we wouldn't go for the whole week because she didn't want to spend that much time around my parents, rather, we'd just go for four days. I was worried about the optics of how that would look to my parents, but fortunately, neither of my brothers and their families could come for the whole week, either.

I texted my parents to let them know that we'd only be going for four days, and shit totally hit the fan. I received a text from my Mom saying how sad and frustrated they are at how they haven't built the relationship with our daughter that they want to, and that they were hoping to spend the entire week with her. She also added that they keep wanting to come to see us, but I keep pushing them away. My mom then went on to say how she never had a relationship with her Grandmother (my Mom is an immigrant, so she never met her grandmother, as she came from her country of orgin), and that she would be sick if our daughter had the same relationship. She then went on to say how all three of her sons had great relationships with our grandparents, and we (my parents) never stood in the way of those relationships.

Anyways, I'm just at my wits end with this. I can't exactly say ""well Mom, a big reason why I keep dodging your visits is because my wife hates you and your visits cause her massive anxiety."" I feel like I've been able to put up this charade to them that everything is fine, but this feels like a house of cards that's about to fall over. Honestly, I just want everyone to get along, and I hate that both my Mom, and my Wife are upset at me, but both sides just keep digging their heels further into the ground, and I have no idea what to do here to keep the peace.

TL;DR: My wife and my parents don't get along. My parents want to come to visit us and build a relationship with our daughter. My wife feels that they haven't earned the right to do so, but my parents don't like that I keep denying their visits, but I can't tell them why my wife doesn't want them visiting.",,,,,,,,
"I(28f) feel ready to move to my ex/friend's(26f) city, despite it playing a role in our breakup","I (28F) and my ex/friend (26F) broke up last year after a LDR. She wanted me to move down to her, I didn't feel ready/got cold feet, we talked l, and we both determined that while we loved each other, our future long term goals just didn't match. She wanted to move and settle on the west coast while I wanted stay on the east coast near my family. Despite our break-up, we managed to repair and remain friends, which leads me to my conundrum. 

When we initially broke up, I had been offered a job in her city, as I had been looking ao I could move to her. After turning it down citing issues moving, they counter offered me and allowed me to work remotely. Now, I feel more ready to move to the city that my job is in and where my ex/friend is. The issue is, I'm kind of afraid to tell her. Me not moving was part of the reason we broke up in the first place, and I'm afraid that it will fully destroy our relationship if I decide to move and she feels betrayed. But I wanted to move then(just got too nervous) and want to move now. Does anyone have any advice how I should approach this? Does it sound like I'm overthinking this?

A 6 year relationship down the drain,"I don’t know where to go from here. A 6 year relationship down the drain. 

My (27F) ex (29M) had weightloss surgery a little over a year ago now and (after losing over 100lbs) out of nowhere said he needed some time to see if he still wanted our relationship. That was on our anniversary in November. I spent thanksgiving by myself and on Christmas Day he gave me a card with a typed letter saying he couldn’t do this anymore but still wants to be friends.  

I’m shocked and hurt. We have an apartment, phone lines, and pets together. We were saying to buy a house out of state to be closer to his family. Now all those plans mean nothing. He keeps in contact with me daily through text and even checks in when I don’t respond. 

A few days before he dumped me he texted me a TikTok, and when I opened it in app another person’s username and picture popped up saying they sent me the TikTok video. I clicked on the profile and saw it was a woman’s soft porn account on TikTok. I asked him if he knew anybody by that name and he lied and said no. Eventually it came out that this was his friend he was helping build a social media following (he is a truck driver). He had left several comments under her videos saying how beautiful she is. 

I recently found out that same “friend” posted my ex on a date with her on her Instagram with heart emojis. The post was from a week after he dumped me. My heart is shattered. I really can’t understand how he could jump to another woman in a week after being with me for 6 years. I can’t understand why he kept in contact with me while seeing someone else. 

To put the cherry on top, he took off work to come into town for my birthday this weekend. I never asked or implied I wanted him to. Now he’s saying he needs to explain it to me in person because I just don’t understand him. What’s there to understand? What’s there to further explain? 

TLDR: My ex dumped me and I’m finding out now about possible cheating. He wants to explain in person, but I’m not sure what more there is to explain.",,,,,,,,

Please help me (20F),"Please help me (20F)

Me and my boyfriend (22F) of 5 years just got into a huge fight. He got in my face about not doing the dishes after I cooked and I was trying to push him away. He kept slapping me so I retaliated. I scratched him to try and move away. He grabbed me and shook me like a rag doll, making my ear piercings bleed. He told me to get out. I had nowhere to go so I didn’t. We were arguing, he went to grab a dirty rag from the dishes, soaked it and scrubbed me all over as I just had a fake tan done. He wanted to cut off my freshly dyed hair. He started messaging my dad telling him to get me to leave him alone. I started to pack my stuff up and leave but I kept asking him to calm down to talk. He got in my face again. I slapped him. I shouldn’t have. He reacted again and spat on me numerous times. Slapped me, spanked me, grabbed me so hard my arms are numb. Then, he got my childhood teddy I cannot sleep without and ripped it’s head clean off. I screamed, he was so angry at me that I screamed ‘trying to get the police called’ over a teddy bear. I left after that. He texted me saying he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore and he breaks up with me. 

I’m so confused. It was his birthday yesterday. We had a great day..

TL;DR: my boyfriend kicked me out and I have nowhere to go. I feel lost and I don’t know what to do. Any advice or help?",,,,,,,,
My (34) year old Girlfriend has initiated a break after nearly 4 years. I'm 38. What can I/should I do?,"I will preface this by saying the following: 

I was diagnosed with stress and depression due to work related issues in January (think 70 hours a week, stressful job role and work life in general. Currently on medication for depression, which is helping). I am also on the bipolar spectrum, and receiving help.

So, up until the 3 year mark, back in November everything seemed to be going fine, we'd never argued, and I mean ever, everything seemed perfect. She lost 2 people very close to her (one of which was her boss, from cancer, the other her grandfather who passed after a fall at home).

I've never really had a high sex drive, and this hasn't been as much of an issue. We'd be intimate 2-3 times a week, but it didn't seem bad. I should add, before we got together I'd been single for over 10 years, and she'd been single for at least 4 or 5. Our views on life matched, interests etc

January rolls around, and I'm signed work for 3 weeks with the above mentioned stress and depression from work. She had mentioned that she wasn't as happy as she normally was. I tried to rectify this whilst also working through my own issues. 

Throughout our relationship, I've always earnt more money, and had no issues paying for anything she needed (fuel, cigarettes, anything), and still happy to do so.

However. The last month or so, possibly longer,  things haven't been the same at all. Not bad, just different. I know she's been helping one of her male friends with depression, no issue with me, I'm not the jealous type. She's been going on walks with him and just generally being there for him. 

We went away for a weekend break last week. Throughout the break, she was distant, barely showed me any affection, there was no intimacy at all. We got home Monday, and she sent me message (I was outside smoking a cigarette, she was upstairs in our bedroom), basically saying she wants a break, and that she feels the relationship has fizzled out, amongst other things (I'm happy to add the message here for added clarification).

The last few days I've been sleeping I  the spare room, which is fine. There has been zero communication between us at all, either face to face or via message, and we message all the time, everyday. Alarm bells have been ringing and I suspect she may be seeing someone else. 

What do I do? I feel like a stranger in my own home. Are we over? Her family are furious with for treating me this way, and believe I'm the best thing that's happened to her in a long time. 

TL:DR: Relationship of 4 years on break, unsure of what to do and need advice.",,,,,,,,
How do I (21F) get over my ex (21M)?,"I’m looking for advice on how to get over my ex, even though he has really hurt me. It’s been rough since September 2022. We dated for 2.5 years prior. I told him I needed some space (breakup) to focus on getting into my dream masters program with less than a 5% acceptance rate (I needed 5 A+). He agreed and was waiting for me. I fucked up by never giving him an end date. But he never expressed to me he was tired of waiting and communicated his feelings. I just knew he was a little confused on why we couldn’t be together but for my mental health, I couldn’t worry about another person right now. Keep in mind every weekend we told each other we still loved each other and can’t wait to marry each other. 

In Jan 2023, he flirted with my best friend at a party and over text and she sent me the screenshots. I understand we’re both “single” but it was not cool of him to go for my friend. He apologized profusely and told me he still loves me and I said I would try and forgive him. 2 weeks later we got into an argument and he lashed out at me. He told me he doesn’t feel anything, cannot love anyone, doesn’t love me, doesn’t care about me, wouldn’t care if I died etc. That hurt my feelings a lot. I poured my heart out and wrote him a long apology on text and he told me he still wanted to be with me. Obviously this left me confused, so I called him 2 weeks after that begging for him back and he called me back the next day saying his answer is no. I found out he’s talking to someone else now 3 weeks after we last spoke. All of the things he’s doing and have said have really hurt me and I’m trying my hardest to move forward but I’m going through a major depressive episode. How do I get over this?

tldr: my ex hurt me really badly and I can’t get over him",,,,,,,,
I (f23) looked at my boyfriend’s (m23) phone and he was talking about me,"So I took my boyfriend of two years to family supper at my dads house. It was just as family dinners go, a lot of talking and sitting and not super exciting for anyone. After supper was over, I was just about to head out and bring my boyfriend home. We’re standing next to each other and I notice he’s typing super quickly large paragraph and I unfortunately did look over and notice my own name. So curiosity got the better of me and I read what he was saying about me. It was a message to his brother that read, “I HATE having supper with _____’s family. Every single fucking time I just sit here for hours staring at the floor. I can’t fucking stand it.” When I saw this I immediately felt awful for looking at his phone, and awful I put him in a situation that made him feel this way. After I brought him back to his place I asked him if he had an okay time and he just told me yes it was nice. I admitted to what I saw on his phone and he told me that I was invading his privacy and that message was not meant for me to see, which I completely understood. However, he never told me how he felt, only told his siblings. 

We’ve had arguments before about family gatherings, he would be on his phone for a lot of them, or make small remarks that he wanted to leave, and once saying “if I was home I’d be eating by now”. This makes me feel really bad, but also doesn’t make me want to invite him to any more gatherings. And since this incident, I haven’t. I know I invaded his privacy, but I can’t help but think, if he doesn’t want to be around my family so much, then why does he agree to come? Or why are we dating if he can’t stand to just sit and smile instead of be silent and stare at the ground. 

TL;DR took my boyfriend of 2 years to a family dinner. Looked over at his phone and saw that he was telling his brother how much he hated having family dinner with my family. He never addressed it. He complains every single time even though I’ve tried to make it as painless as possible and even stress that there’s no hard feelings if he doesn’t come.",,,,,,,,
Friend goes on long monologues and doesn't want me to participate,"My (28F) friend (28M) of 5 years likes to go on really long monologues that often span multiple topics. They're not conversations, they're just one-sided monologues that last for like ten minutes at a time.

If I try to jump in to say something, they get upset and say I'm interrupting and not letting them finish, even if they've already been talking for minutes already and have gone through 2-3 topics. They say I won't be able to comment 'properly' because I 'haven't let them finish' or 'haven't let them get to the point'.

I've tried to explain it's hard to stay engaged when they just go on and on in a string of topics in great detail, and that it's hard to have a conversation that way, and they insist that it's not even supposed to be a conversation but an ""essay"", and that I'm just supposed to respond when they're done and have made their grand overarching point, and only then will I understand enough to have a worthy response at all.

I don't sit there making notes to respond to once they've finished jumping between talking about four different topics in great detail. And many of these topics are like political history or related to controversial topics they read in the news which they already know I'm not totally interested in; I know they're not interested in some of my hobbies and don't push it on them.

But they get so. mad. if I try to participate before they've ""finished"" or remark that I can't just stand around listening to an ""essay"" about three random topics they're trying to string together. He says that I miss the point and can't comment, but the topics are literally so random and if it's been like 10 minutes and he still hasn't gotten to the point, I just don't care.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to talk to them about it because they just get mad at me for trying to interject or for saying I can't just sit and listen to the 10 minute monologue without making a peep. If I don't do that, they say they hate talking to me. Is there any way to talk about this?  


TLDR; Friend almost daily talks for a long time about random things in great detail and just wants me to sit there and shut up while he goes on and on, I can only talk when he's done. He's mad at me because I told him that's hard to pay attention for that long or that it's annoying to not be able to participate. How do I salvage it?",,,,,,,,

I [25F] don't think that my relationship is working with my [35M] boyfriend.,"
I have been with my boyfriend for 9-10 months now and we are pretty serious. We've met last year when he was living in the same city, then he had to move for work, and for me that was chocking. But  we didn't find a choice then to go long distance since we don't want to break up and we are not interested in other people. 



It's not like we're fighting a lot. But I never liked being apart. He doesn't show how bad it is, but I'm always being emotional about it. Especially that both our love languanges is physical touch. We are hoping to be reunited soon. But I don't want to let it affect us. I tend to be angry especially that we can't communicate as we do in real life. Plus we have two hours of time difference so we are not talking as we did before. 

It sucks, I never learned to live with it. Escpecially that he is my best friend and the only person I talk to on a daily basis and I am quite attached. His departure for work was sudden and I never really processed it. 
I am trying to live with it until we hopefully reunite. I don't want my emotions to be in the way. It takes strengh for this. 

TL;DR I believe that distance is ruining my relationship. Can you please tell me how should I deal with this?",,,,,,,,
Am I missing obvious hints?,"A few months ago during my uni holidays I (20M) got messaged fully out of the blue by this girl (let’s call her 20F) I knew from school who I hadn’t talked to since we were last in school 2 years before. 

She just asked how I’ve been and if I wanted to go for coffee sometime and I was like sure, not thinking anything of it since I had quite a few classes with her back in school so we definitely weren’t strangers to each other or anything.

We catch up over coffee and again I’m thinking completely nothing of it and as we leave she’s like “hopefully see you soon!”. Even then though, I figured she’s just being friendly and wanted to stay in touch a bit more often than every 2 years lmao.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks later, I’m out for lunch with one of my long time close family friends who also happens to be 20F’s best friend. At some point in the conversation she randomly mentions “oh, by the way 20F is free to hang out this weekend” and doesn’t say anything else about it for the rest of the lunch.

So I figure I’ll message 20F cos she’s good company and we go out again (should specify all these in the story are lunches, no dinners or whatever) and at the end she asks if I’m free next weekend. At this point I’m kinda wondering if she’s interested in dating but she could easily just wanna be friends too.

We go out the next weekend but then we’re both busy for a while and don’t meet again for almost a month with only kinda occasional messaging.

But then in this between period, my mum and close family friends mum go out for lunch which is pretty standard for them. What isn’t standard is that family friends mum talks to MY MUM about ‘me and 20F’. As you can imagine, I’m pretty confused why my friends mum would know since I’ve barely even mentioned it to my mum cos I didn’t think it was anything important lol. This is when I start questioning whether she’s interested or not since why would our mutual close friend’s mum know we’ve been hanging out if it was just as friends.

So fast forward to the next time me and 20F meet and it goes more or less the same as the previous couple of times. As we’re leaving we both agree we should hang out more regularly during uni but nothing in our interaction that would suggest anything more than good friends.

Since then we’ve met up when we’ve been free and it’s basically the same pattern with only occasional messaging etc though I guess we know each other a bit better now so convos flow some more

Basically, am I missing some obvious hints? From my POV I’d say I’m interested in her romantically but I’m also happy with being friends and so I don’t really wanna ruin that and make things awkward if she doesn’t feel the same way.

TLDR:

Girl I knew from school messages out of nowhere asking to catch up and I thought nothing of it, kinda mixed signals from there due to things I heard from mutual friend. Unsure whether or not she’s interested romantically or simply wants to be friends.",,,,,,,,
"I(15M) said it was my dream to make music with my girlfriend one day, while my girlfriend(15F) who knows nothing about music was there and now she is shying away from me, I don't know what to do","

So I'm a 15 year old guy, all of my family plays instruments it's kind of a thing from a young age, I can play guitar, bass and piano to varying degrees of skill. With that I have a girlfriend who doesn't play any instrument. This isn't a problem for me, it never was a problem or a downside to dating her. Yesterday after school my friends and I were on the bus talking about music and such, which turned into 2 of my friends (excluding me) having a conversation about that one of them wouldn't want to date someone who wasn't into music and playing instruments. I chimed in and said ""I think it's definitely a bonus if a girl is into music like that but it isn't a deal breaker, making music with my girlfriend sounds like a dream though"" now when saying that I'm in my girlfriends arms and I didn't think anything of it or she would he offended at all. She didn't act offended until when we were on discord that night in a private call she said ""I think I want to learn how to play piano because I want to make your dreams come true"" I said that was great but what did she mean about making my dreams come true. She said on the bus I said it's attractive when a girl plays a instrument and how it's a dream to make music with your girlfriend and I don't want you to leave me for someone who can do all of that"" In that moment I didnt know what to say, I ended up saying I would never leave her for a reason like that and I like her for her and she shouldn't want to change for me or anyone else. She told me she was gonna go. Today in school she didn't say much about anything to me and she has been slow to replying to text and such. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like I really messed up and I just don't know where to start to fix it


Td;lr I said Its my dream to make music with girlfriend one day and now my girlfriend who doesn't know anything about music feels like I'm not in our relationship for the long haul.",,,,,,,,
I'm (25f) Emotionally cheating on bf (31m) and can't stop,"My bf and I have been together for 3 years now and we have a 1 year old together. This issue started in year 2 of our relationship and when I was pregnant. I would still keep in touch with guys I've previously been with and post updates about my life on social media, like cute pics and eat up all the attention I get from them, which one of the guys I've had a situationship with when I was younger(we went to the same junior high) turned into emotional cheating because he seems to know how to make me feel better whenever I vent about my bf, and makes me feel special. We had met up in person too because I wanted a break from household chores, and he was being really sweet throughout the night, but he did keep holding / touching me subtly in sensitive areas. I didn't really know how to react. But I won't lie it felt nice. I don't want to shit on my bf but I've been feeling neglected and more arguments happen that exhaust me ever since we had our baby, and he does really try to grow our relationship but I keep seeking external validation from other men. Including online. 

How can I stop seeking online validation?

How do I know if it’s okay to break up without a good reason?,"Hi. So. I’ve (26F) have been dating this guy (25M) for four months now and we’ve been going steady. Now, this would be my third serious relationship and everything feels great except when it doesn’t. He’s honest and very good guy. Listens to me and wants to be there for me. Yet, I just don’t feel like he’s the one. I mean, I felt like that on our first few dates but it kind of faded. I want to be with someone who’s a lot more into me. In short even though he assures me that he’s not into anyone else, and would never cheat, I feel he can put in a little more effort. He agrees with me when I bring it up and has mended his ways a lot. But I still don’t feel secure. I keep looking for issues. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. If it’s just trauma from my previous relationship. I just don’t want to be with someone if I don’t feel safe. But I also don’t want to hurt him or break up with him without a proper reason because I’m afraid it’s just my head playing games with me. I do like him and care for him a lot. Just not sure if he’s someone I want to share my life with. 

TL;DR I want to break up with my boyfriend even though I don’t have a real reason but not sure if I should stay in it a little long to find out.",,,,,,,,
My(18) Girlfriend (18) can’t go out often with me.,"There’s this girl I’ve been dating since middle of December and it’s been 4 months together we’ve only been on 2 dates supposedly her parents don’t let her go out often and that she can only go out once a month with me I’m bummed out of the situation that I’m in she’s the first girlfriend I have and I want to go out with her more often and not just once a month but we spend most of the time on FaceTime with each other but I would rather want to spend it face to face with her I would say every 2 weeks we can go out and not just once a month 
Should I breakup with her and look for someone with more freedom or let things take course and hope they let her out more often with me 
I don’t mind ft her it’s just that I would rather prefer to go out with her than see her on a screen.
 I want to go out more frequently with her but her parents don’t let her I’ve talked to her about me wanting to go out more often and she said that she’ll try to talk to them about it 
I love her but not being able to out with her frequently and calling on ft is tearing me up because I want to spend more time face to face with her.
Not being able to go out with her as often is kind of making me lose feelings towards her and I don’t want that shoud I break up with her or should I hold on strong.

TL;DR: my girlfriend can’t go out as often I want to spend time with her and it’s making me lose feelings towards her.",,,,,,,,
Did I do the right thing by ending a group friendship?,"We’re all the same age (F24) and we all went to the same uni. 

Let’s imagine we all were beans and each of us had a number. I would be bean 2, and they would be bean 1 and 3. I’ve known bean 3 longer than bean 1; I met bean 1 before bean 3 did and whilst I was in hospital bean 3 and 1 became close friends. Then after bean 3 graduated we didn’t speak as much together as a trio and I became close to bean 1. 

Anyway, fast forward to now we named ourselves beans and became a trio. Most of our exchanges are through a group chat on instagram but we all meet up twice a month as well.

So here is where you guys tell me where I went wrong. To preface, I know I went wrong here: I have a history of leaving the group chat… as a result bean 1 told me whilst we were all having drinks that if I ever leave the chat she will never put me back in it again. The first time I left was over a misunderstanding that bean 1 told me I caused. (I can’t remember so I wont revise) The second time was a joke and the third time was this time around, following bean 1’s warning.

I’ll start with day 1 as the whole thing occurred over a few days. During day 1 I got annoyed at both beans and sent a couple of messages at midnight explaining my frustration with feeling invalidated and also feeling like it is insensitive to keep recommending I talk to the “professional” who works closely with me but I don’t trust, even though I was talking to them specifically. (It wasn’t trauma dumping don’t worry) I then unsent those messages, and neither of them saw it. 

Then, early in the morning of day 2, bean 3 sends in memes and I realise that I can’t let it go, but I’m also aware she has work so it’s tricky to explain that I’m annoyed but it doesn’t have to be addressed now. But I manage to explain my frustration with telling me to talk to someone I don’t trust, feeling invalidated and understanding she’s going to work. She replies saying sorry I’m going to work so I can’t read/reply right now. Then she starts replying half heartedly anyway. I let her know that I don’t want to see memes in the chat whilst I’m annoyed. She says “k”. Bean 3 is known as the sweet and sensitive bean, she’s unusually good at avoiding being rude so this was very obtuse from her. In a fit of anger I leave the group chat.

I am aware leaving the chat basically says “don’t speak to me” but day 3 is a big day for me and both beans know that. I put up a story on the evening of day 2, referencing my nervousness for day 3 - a suggestion from my sister. Neither of them see it.

So on day 3, in the afternoon before my “event” I reach out and ask them separately for a good luck. By the evening my story expires. At some point I also put a close friends note up referencing the event (this is just for fun and not their attention). And fast forward to day 4 (today) they both still had not opened my messages, 24 hours later. 

I could make a bunch of excuses for why they didn’t reply but my working theory is they both agreed on it together to not reply.

Anyway, a few hours after the 24 hours are up they still haven’t replied so I unfriend them on all the applications and that’s the end. Was I right?

TLDR: my friends ignored (or ghosted) me for a day together, which is highly unusual, so I decided to delete them off of social media.",,,,,,,,
Thoughts? M18 F18,"I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for the last 4 months and one time when we were on ft with each other I was sharing my screen with her and I had come across a par where it was a model and she told me that her past bf also did this once and that she had him over and when he scrolled through a post like that she had squished him with her legs in which he was laying on her stomach and when I told her I wanted to do that too like come over and hangout with her she told me that she snuck him in without her parents knowing plus she said she didn’t like it when he came over so I asked her why didn’t you tell him no and she said because he forced himself in and when I tell her that I want to come over and hang out she told me she doesn’t want to sneak me in and that she “wants to do it right with me” I don’t know what she means by that and why she doesn’t want me to come 
Over this is eating me alive inside knowing that he forced himself in to her room where I can’t even come over to her home 
P.s he let himself in 5 times and she got in trouble for it by just her parents telling her not to do it anymore 
I’ve talked to her about me wanting to hangout more often and she said she’ll try to negotiate with her parents plus she said her parents don’t like people coming over

I am [F23] losing attraction to my boyfriend [M27] after he cried in front of me.,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years, and 2 days ago we were watching the latest season of You on netflix, and he got a phone call, he still won't tell me who called or what it was about, but im pretty sure the person that called was his father, they talked for like 5-10 minutes, and he got very angry and started yelling out insults and then he just yelled and hung up. I asked him who it was and what it was about and he just said its fine, its nothing, he just said not to worry about it and we'll talk about it later, so we started watching another episode of You, but like an hour later, he was laying with his head on my thighs and he started sobbing crying, and i tried to support him and everything i told him its all okay, he said that hes sorry and he just left to go to the gym but didn't come home until a day later so i think he just slept at his brothers place.

I know i seem evil for this but i just dont feel the same attraction to him after he cried and i really really want to fix this, i love my boyfriend and everything and i feel like an idiot for feeling like this. I dont know why it's happening, like in the 3 years of us being together, i've always had this crazy sexual attraction to him, like super submissive ''yes sir'' attitude, but he's tried initiating sex and i just dont feel in the mood to be close to him like that anymore?

TL;DR: Boyfriend cried in front of me and i no longer feel attracted to him.",,,,,,,,
How do you set boundaries,"TL;DR how do I stop people pleasing

I(f19) have started talking to (m23) he keeps stepping over some of the boundaries I tried to set! I can’t for the life of me talk to him about it as I know he’ll blame himself and be sad. 

I have an impossible time setting boundaries, even when people say let me know if I’m making you uncomfortable I know that I won’t. I’m too afraid of upsetting them or making them mad that I’d rather stay in an uncomfortable situation rather than even consider making someone else feel bad! Why do I do this? It always just leads to messed up relationships and friendships but I don’t know why I continue to do it.",,,,,,,,
Every time I(25F)come back home I’m reminded of how my parents relationship showed me what relationship I didn’t want,"My fiance (26M) and I (25F) are visiting my family,we were supposed to leave tomorrow but my grandma tested positive for covid today,so we’re doing a mini quarantine and then we’ll fly back home. We’ve been here for a week and every day I’m reminded that my moms (46F) and my stepdads (51M) relationship showed me what I don’t want in a man and in a relationship &amp; seeing it and not being able to do anything about it is frustrating. 

Is nothing completely wrong, is just that my stepdad is misogynistic and also thinks he’s the center of the universe. And his ignorance makes everyone annoyed and moody and then when you get mad at him and call him out he gets defensive and plays the victim card.

Example : my mom has been dealing all day with my grandma because she’s having a lot of symptoms plus she’s working from home and my grandma is exhausting,my grandma doesn’t listen and acts like a 6 year old (character wise) sometimes. My mom is stressed and exhausted and my stepdad has been saying “when’s the food going to be ready?” “Where’s my plate?” “Why are you so moody? 🙄” 

Then my mom goes “I’m exhausted and I just want to rest” and he goes “well I’m exhausted as well,i work hard out there and I want to rest as well yet you don’t see me throwing a tantrum”, keep in mind that he got home at 12pm from work and it’s 7pm and all he’s been doing is watching tv on the couch. My mom tells him “why does everything have to be a competition with you,I’m exhausted let me be exhausted” and walks away and now he’s annoyed because my mom is angry. 

I looked at my fiancé and rolled my eyes and told him “I can’t wait to go back home,although I’m always grateful they showed me what I didn’t want in a relationship and that I actively looked for the opposite of what they are”.

TL;DR! My fiancé and I are stuck at my parents home quarantining and my stepdad and his ignorance remind me that they taught me what type of relationship I don’t want.",,,,,,,,
Why would he have added on what he did to his statement if we were just friends? 25 F 24 M,"M

I recently had a really great guy walk into my life, but I’m trying really hard to recover from being roofied, and I know I’m getting better, but still not in shape to be dating. 

I finally decided to tell this guy, what I had been through. He told me how sorry he was for me, and how no one should have to go through what I have. 

I then heard him quietly say “Especially not you” 

It caught me by surprise and I wondered why he’d add that in. We are just friends after all.

I(18F) tolf my mom(40s&amp,F) I would off myself if I can't liveout my career," My(18F) whole life I knew I wanted to be a performer, specifically an actress-mainly. Growing up, many people always compared me to being an actress or I've been told I have broadway-esk type of talent and soul. I can't see myself doing anything else really (besides writing maybe) I've always been very passionate about performing. My heart belongs to the arts truly. I want to go to college for it, I interned at a theatre program. I've done many shows in and out of school and I'm getting ready for a few performances coming soon. 

  My family knows and they are the same ones that have predicted me as an artist. However, they are not from the US or western society at all (Jamaicans) and as I'm approching college and really my career, I want to major performing arts. My mom(40s&amp;F) wants me to minor in something and I'm trying to find something to minor in. She says she refuses to spend her money on unrealistic stuff.

  She knows saying that stuff hurts me because this is truly my passion. Everytime I try looking into careers I could do besides acting. It always go back to the entertainment industry. I know if I can't persue that career, I refuse to continue on living. I've accepted that for a very long time. I'm not afriadof death anymore, I've made attemps: The only thing stopping me is literally performing arts. Performing is the nly thing that makes me happy and is the only reason i continue living. I truly know I have a shot. Many of my teachers/mentor who also perform agree. Although they do also say I'm good at socalizing, team work, connecting, and writing and I could find another career with those skills.

  Today my aunt(55F) called my mother's phone and she was on speaker through the car. I wanted to talk about my act that I'm working on for a spring show and somehow it became a lecture about my hair,(I wear wigs and weaves) following crowds(I simply want to cut my hair), to my career(acting/performing). It got to a point where my aunt said: ""What other careers are you interested in? What are some of your skills?"" To which my mother replid ""she has no skills"", mmy aunt literally had to tell her to shut up because of how rude that was. (And it really hurt my feelings). I endd up immedating that I would kill myself because I don't a life without my passion. My mom said ""well make sure you have my money to owe back before you do it"" My aunt her shocked by the comments and said that, that was not normal. 

  She said she only brought it up because someone in our family daughter(20s&amp;F) went to LA to become an actress and now she does porn an my aunt's husband's(55M) nefew(46M) went as well a long time ago and now barely gets booked. ( I don't even want to go to LA yet, I want to go to college in NY or Atlanta to study acting and do stage acting first) She said it's also dangerous as people can take advanage of me and I'm a black woman. However (sorta sad to admit) I know the industry is quite racist, I'm no longer a baby, I've delt with racism and I'm always going to. I ended up crying which caused my aunt to say sorry while my mom said she's not because she's being realistic and telling me the truth. Now she's sitting around mad at me and tying to take anger out on me in any way even though I'm trying to stay awayfrom her right now. 

  I don't know what to do nw. I'm super frustrated now. I also signed up for ccp for 12th grade so I can have a more higher learning on acting itself so I can improve. 

tldr; told my mom I would off myself if I can't make it to my passion/future career of performing arts after he told me to find a minor and Now she's mad",,,,,,,

My(f18) boyfriend(m18) has really religious parents who are trying to ruin his career for leaving the church/coming out by framing him for something he didn't do,"**TL;DR**: My boyfriend's parents looked up inappropriate searches on his phone (CP) in recent years that they are trying to threaten him with if he leaves the church/comes out because they think he's feminine, and he feels powerless to confront them 

Hey guys. We met in youth group, but his parents were more strict than mine. I have a job, but his parents didn't let him work. I've been helping him apply for his first job, but his parents are refusing to give him work papers among others until he graduates. I've talked to my parents who don't believe that they would even after he graduates in a few months, but I'm writing this because his father is threatening him, and he struggled to open up to me until recently

His parents think he's feminine because he did ballet, and they've been questioning his gender identity too. He is straight, but they refuse to believe it. They took him out of ballet for those reasons when he was 13, but he's kept an interest in it and expressed wanting to go back to it too. However, he never expressed it to his parents. They found out through parental controls that track his search history and I think messages, and they still have them on to this day until he graduates (but I don't believe they'd remove them). They'll probably will keep it for as long as they're paying for his phone plan, and they never allowed him to work/kept papers to prevent him. He's also stretched/practiced at home to upkeep some of his skills over the years, and that led to arguments on top of the search results involving ballet too. However, they are threatening to ruin his career if he stops going to church/comes out upon graduation

His parents had a policy growing up that involved going through his phone whenever they wanted because they paid for it or else they'd cancel the phone plan, and sometimes they'd take it when he was sleeping too. He recently told me that he found a lot of searches on his phone that he never searched in recent years, and many are inappropriate searches such as ""nak\*d teen gymnasts/poses"" that could identity as CP that one of his parents looked up. His father told him that he'd release the search history if he ever left the church or came out as gay/bi, and by release he means make a post about how he left the church and would be disowned for looking it up when he never did. My parents know I'm not religious despite being Christians and are supportive of our relationship, and they hate his parents too. I'm actually an atheist, but I haven't come out, and I don't plan to until I move out. My boyfriend's not a Christian too, but he obviously isn't gonna say that now. We want to move out together, but he's afraid to tell anyone about his parent's threat because he thinks it'll ruin his career/chances of getting a job, so I wanted to ask online for advice on what to do because he feels powerless to leave them with their threat in case someone doesn't believe him",,,,,,,,
"My (27M) best friend (26F) doesn’t think we can be friends anymore, or at least for a while, and I don’t understand why","So some backstory, we met when we both were juniors in college. I developed feelings for her after like a year and asked her out. She said she couldn’t be more than just friends with me for some reasons that I can’t say here, but they are pretty static and still haven’t changed. I really was heartbroken and needed some space from her and told her that. 3/4 months pass and i felt like I moved on, so I told her that I missed our friendship and wanted to see if we could pick back up, which she said yes to. We both eventually moved to different states but still talk every day, from “good morning” until “goodnight”. We both sleep super late so usually just stay up texting each other. 

Fast forward to about a week ago, and we went on a trip together. We booked the 1 room with 1 bed which I admittedly didn’t think would be an issue, and neither did she. Both of us are pretty introverted so we stayed in a lot and just watched TV together in bed. On the day before we left, I wasn’t feeling well so I asked her if I could cuddle and she said yes so we cuddled while watching TV for a couple hours before going to bed. The day after, we say our goodbyes and leave separately. She seemed a bit bothered the day we left but I figured she was just tired because we slept super late.

Overall, I thought the weekend was really fun and I loved spending time with her again as it it had been so long. We were laughing, joking, having a great time, and nothing seemed weird really until the morning we left, like I mentioned. When I got home however, I got a voicemail from her saying that she thinks we’re too close and that we can’t be friends and so she wants to go no contact “for a while”. I called her up and told her that I respect what she wants and that I’m always here whenever she thinks we can be friends again. 

It’s been all of like 4 days, and I’m definitely not handling it well. She was my best friend and a huge part of my support system for dealing with stuff like this. Now I feel super alone, and I miss her more than I thought I could and every little thing reminds me of her. I feel like complete shit, and my chest physically hurts when I think of her. 

I’m now a mix of confused and sad and I don’t know how to deal; we went from literally talking every day throughout the day to not talking at all because we’re “too close”. I would’ve thought that we could just set limits for how much we talk if she thinks we’re too close because we already live in different states anyways. But she thinks we need to go full no contact, and I guess I don’t understand why. Am I missing something here? I want to give her the space she’s asking for but what if she doesn’t reach out? I wanted to wait like 3-4 weeks and then reach out to her to see if we could be friends again. Is that selfish of me to ask? I would appreciate any help! 

**TL;DR: Best friend and I took a trip together which went well I thought. We shared a bed and cuddled for a little and now she says we’re too close and says we need to go no contact for an unspecified time. What’s going on?**",,,,,,,,
Previous girlfriend probably had sex with my dad,"

Hey there. I'm 29 year old guy who lives in the US. Met my ex (40F)  abroad, she's from the UK. My dad might have had sex with my girlfriend with a chance that she got pregnant. Of course I can't verify anything without a DNA test which is rough. Our relationship lasted 4 years.

Tldr: my ex might have had a 2 week-long fling with my dad. Not sure if the child is mine or my dads. Not sure how to move on from being cheated on. I want to heal and move on as a young dad.


Met and started dating a british woman abroad. I came back to the states and was hospitalized for mental health issues, PTSD, mania. Later on my girlfriend (now ex) flew to the US to stay at my dads house while I was getting mental health treatment. She stayed at his place for 2 weeks, sleeping in the room next to his, and they were mostly home alone together. I was freaked out about this. Why? My dad is a serial cheater and before I was hospitalized he told me ""When your girlfriend comes to visit I'm going to fuck her because she's closer to my age."" Charming. He's cheated on his wife and brags about it. 

My ex picked me up from the hospital and we drove 10 hrs to go stay at my dads. We stayed somewhere and had unprotected sex because I'm an idiot and mania. She told me she wanted a kid.l, and I said I did too. On the way back to me dad's I asked her if she drank with him. She said ""We had a bottle of wine, I took a hit of THC from his pen."" I asked what happened after and she said ""We just sat on the couch."" I asked what happened next, and she brushed me off and wouldn't say. I specifically asked if they had sex and she said they didn't. I didn't believe her. The next few days of staying at my dads, she insisted on having me go work a random 2am shift at a warehouse (leaving her alone with my dad). So I did. On the commute she texted me a nude of her laying in bed, in the bedroom next to my dads. 

Guys this has been hell. I've been going to therapy for half a year and it helps but it's hard thinking she did that. I'm scared the child may not be mine. What if they didn't use protection? Idk.

One morning while we were staying at my dads, my ex said she was flying back to UK soon, and my dad sighed and looked all sad about it. He said ""Can't you stay longer?"" 

Also after their potential fling I asked my dad again if they had sex. He said ""it never crossed my mind"" with a weird grin. He says ""go ahead and take a DNA test, I'll pay for it."" He wants it shipped to and from him to have control. Everytime I ask my ex if she had sex with my dad, she blows up and freaks out. 

Btw we don't even need him for a DNA test. Just me, my ex, and my boy. 

As far as suspecting my ex, I found a hidden drawer with a second phone with texts on there of her and another guy (they'd seen each other during our relationship). Found nude videos of other men on her phone. Everything is date stamped to be within the timeframe of our relationship. She says it was platonic, that she never cheated on me. 

So here's what I think is going on. I am probably in the wrong and just paranoid/delusional, in need of further mental health help, I could see that. I'm in therapy still and have received some help with this infidelity/parental uncertainty thing. But at the same time the fear they had sex and that my child is not mine is so strong. It's probably ok, people cheat all the time and he might have had a vasectomy? I hope he had one. 

Why can't she just tell me what happened between them? Then I could get closure but for real I don't think I'll ever get that. As for the child, I Skype my boy once a week and it sucks not being with him but I'll be there any way I can for now. Want to live with him but he's an ocean away. I shouldn't have started a relationship with an older woman when I was manic, I should have got treatment right away. If I'm wrong, I need to apologize. Thanks for reading this, and if you have any advice on what to do, please let me know. 

1) How to forgive them both? 
2) Should I get the DNA test?
3) how do I co-parent when I cannot block my ex?",,,,,,,,
Should he be keeping secrets from his gf?,"
I (21 female) and my ex boyfriend (21 male) broke up a while ago ( we dated for a few months) and he’s recently gotten into a new relationship with someone (20 female)

Him and I are still in close contact and you could just consider us friends now but I’ve also found out that there’s a lot of things that he’s keeping from his girlfriend that she should probably know about

Eg. He has a really shitty past with his his dad and a few “friends”
I’be asked him before if he was planning on ever telling her about anything and he just replied with a “nope”
I asked him why and he said that he’s scared on how he’ll react if he tells her

So is it reasonable that he hasn’t said anything or should him or I bring it up? 
(obviously if I were to bring it up I’d be asking for his permission first)

Ps. I love his girlfriend to bits and Id never want to hurt her but keeping all the stuff I have to can just be a bit exhausting

(TL; DR  So my ex is keeping big secrets from his gf and is scared on how she’ll react if she finds out but is it bad that he’s keeping them? Should someone say something’s about it?)",,,,,,,,
Boyfriend (27m) and I (25f) can’t agree on where to live.,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and moved to a big city together last year to live and work. His work opportunities are far better here than in our home country, and he earns a much higher salary than he would at home. 

One issue we have been having is I would eventually like to move back to our home country, for the sole reason of being closer to my family. I’m very close with my family and love them more than anything. He on the other hand doesn’t share the same close relationship with his family, and thinks parents should “let their kids fly away”. He also doesn’t like to have a detailed plan for his future, and just wants to “see what happens” rather than having a rigid plan in life. I’m not a meticulous planner, but I do like to have an idea of where my life is heading and if we share the same goals.

I love the city and country we moved to, and could definitely see myself here long term if it weren’t for my family back home. He doesn’t want to move back home anytime soon because of the job opportunities here, and I would feel guilty making him move back to our home country just so I could be near my family, if it was not something he truly wanted and just did to make me happy.  

I love him so much and see a future with him, and he loves me too and would like us to get married one day, but this is one big thing that I am struggling with. Is there any sort of compromise that can be made? Have any of you been in a similar position and have any advice? Thank you.

TL;DR: I want to one day move back to our home country to be near my family, and my boyfriend is less keen to move back due to better job opportunities where we are. How can we make it work?",,,,,,,,
(M21) I don’t understand why (F21) women twerk on other women. Why won’t they dance with me?,"I’ve been clubbing for a few months now and the best part for me is when I can dance with a girl. The problem is that it seems a lot of women only want to dance with other women or their boyfriends if they came with one. It’s so crazy. I’ve seen random girls just get behind other girls and smack them on the butt or something and they just start smiling and dancing together. I’ve tried that a few times myself and it’s been hit or miss. I almost got cussed out one time and I got pushed another time. 

I don’t get it. If these women are straight then why wouldn’t they want to dance or grind with a guy. I don’t know if I should just keep trying to get behind girls or smack them on the butt but trying to ask them to dance always fails. I’ve never had it work when I tried to just be polite and ask for a dance. I guess women don’t think that’s confident.

I’m saying this because this is what I keep seeing every time I go. Sometimes girls dance with me and sometimes they won’t but they always dance with other girls. It low key feels like being a woman is a lot more fun than being a man. You don’t really have to prove yourself as a woman. 

Tl;dr women would rather dance with other women",,,,,,,,
I (13F) Think I want to break up with my boyfriend (14M),"I want to start this with I’m autistic and it affects my ability to identify emotions. I talked with him about this before I agreed to go out with him as well as the fact I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and I have prescribed medication for it and he was okay with it all and still wanted to go out with me. This is also my first time posting on Reddit so I apologise if this is a weird layout or it’s not that interesting.

Anyways, Me and him have been dating for about 3 1/2 Months and before we were friends for about 6/7 months and honestly I don’t think I ever have seen him as someone who I would get into a relationship in. I think I liked the idea of him but not actually him but I tricked myself into thinking I liked him. Mentioning this I might of even answered my own question but moving in from that.

When he asked me to go out with him I said yes but as time moved on I don’t think I like him. I kind of dread talking to him, I want to avoid spending time with him (I’ve made excuses not to spend time with him twice out of the 30ish times we hung out and I did try make it up to him after), I hate when anyone finds out we’re together, he’s gotten really cocky recently as well or it could be how he normally acts but just not around me, in addition my friend who was his wingman has also blocked him as he made fun of international woman’s day and was really sexist about it when they brought it up. On another occasion, I got grounded because i missed my curfew and he ended up guilt tripping me to spend time with him and lying to my mum (i live at her house and my parents are divorced) as I wouldn’t be able to spend time with him otherwise and that still doesn’t sit right with me.

Thing is he’s also so really sweet. He gets me my favourite sweets, food, stuffed animals, told his family about me, all his friends about me and has stopped talking to a lot of his female friends for me even though I trust him and the girls but he said he doesn’t want to accidentally flirt with them. He wants to spend time with me and has told me he likes to do anything if it’s with me and when he’s sweet to me I feel so happy but even that feeling has started to wear off and I don’t know if this is normal to feel this way about a relationship.

The biggest problem if we do end up breaking up is we have recently chose our GCSE options and he decided to take 2 of the classes that I also chose one of them because I’m taking it. I have always wanted to do the GCSEs I picked so their is no way in hell I’m switching but both classes are so small that I’m worried that if I break up with him all those classes would be really awkward and I would grow to hate the subjects. I also would even know where to start with actually breaking up with him

TLDR; I overtime i think I realised I don’t want to date my boyfriend anymore or I want to figure a way to fix my relationship with him.",,,,,,,,
Boyfriend making comments on looks,"4 months algo I started seeing a guy(24m) and I am 36f. It was unusual for both but things got really intimate, secure, funny, and I started to heal some parts of me with him. After 2 months he stated telling me how much he loves me, he is really into me and how amazing he feels. I was feeling the same and so happy we were having a nice connection. A month algo or so he started to make frequent remarks about how my skin has some acne ( normal period pimple here and there), how my eyes had some small wrinkles, how I have some stray hairs in my face, how my House is full of cat hair and he is disgusted by It. On the day off his birthday he kicked a balloon directed to my cat Who was sitting comfortably resting and scared her. It was just a balloon, but the intention I didn't like. Last weekend after a loving 2 days together and after just 10 min of telling me he loves me, he tells me he is not confident about me, that people Will think he has a problem because he loves a person older than him, etc. It was very hurtful but I decided It was ending for good. Anyways I feel anxious and I started no contact but my anxiety levels are super high at times and a part of me wants him to regret It.

Would you say his behaviour about my looks was abusive? Comments?

TL;DR;** : boyfriend making mean comments about looks",,,,,,,,
Stuck in a hostile living situation,"(Throwaway) I (28F) want to move out. I live with my older sister and father. I’ve wanted to move out for over five years but each attempt I’ve made to address it has gone horribly wrong. I will admit, my living situation could be described as comfortable in comparison to others. We have a decent sized 3 bedroom apartment, I’m in the master bedroom. My sister cooks meals for us almost every day, but I feel as though I can’t be truly happy here. The reason being is my father. I still love him, but I have heavy resentments I’ve been unable to heal from. I haven’t been given the proper space to make peace with everything and I feel I’ve been forced to bend to his will for for too long. My sister is the opposite. Her strained relationship is with our mother and she is really close with our father. Our father and mother were divorced after we finished highschool. During the whole divorce process we heavily took our father’s side, and now I feel I can empathize with what she went through  since that maltreatment fell upon me. It’s a long story, but the apartment being rented is solely in mine and my sister’s names. He is living with us, he works out of the apartment, he stores all his tools here, and he stores a few project cars here but he also stays half of the week with his girlfriend. I feel like our place is just used as his warehouse. The apartment is digusting, he tried to harass me into letting him use my credit, and we were harassed by court servers and collections because of him years ago. 

My sister is comfortable. We live in a nice area, the weather is very important to her, and the situation is affordable to us. Moving is a hassle and I know she doesn’t want to put in that effort when she feels it’s not necessary. She’s not just my sister, she’s my best friend and I would literally take a bullet for her. I don’t want to be separated. It’s a big reason I stayed this way for so long but I would do what I have to. She’s cool with whatever I want to do, but will not EVER insert herself into the conflict or take a side. I feel like maybe I should be upset with how passive she is but I can’t bring myself to be angry. We went through so much during their divorce. I do not want to live with my mother either.

I’ve asked multiple times to move out throughout the years but it’s gone horribly wrong every time.   My father gets really aggressive. I have to say he has NEVER gotten physical, but he does have horrible anger problems. Yelling, stomping, spamming messages, etc to the point where you can’t function for work the next day (nor can he). Recently he has gotten better. I feel like he had tried to listen the few times I’ve attempted to speak out but the damage is already done. I still really don’t like talking to him, I hold out in my room most of the time until my sister comes home. He did recently bring up that he would be up to moving out since his girlfriend wants help with her rent and to go full time with him. This made me unbelievably happy, but bitter too. It wasn’t because I asked and I know its not going to be anytime soon. He said he still has to fix up the cars and sell them, but who knows how long that will take. He doesn’t hold well to his words. If I left the decision to my sister and father I would be stuck here for so many more years to come.

I want to get out of here. That might be impossible financially for just me and it may fracture my relationship with my father beyond repair. The ideal would be my sister and I living on our own with out having to deal with our parents. This might just be more of a vent, I know I’m an adult and I can force myself out but I’m scared of all the repercussions. 

(TLDR) I want to move out of my apartment, but my father has very extreme reactions when it’s not beneficial to him. I just want options on how I can go about this and to hear other experiences.",,,,,,,,

Why would he have added on what he did to his statement if we were just friends? 25 F 24 M,"
I recently had a really great guy walk into my life, but I’m trying really hard to recover from being roofied, and I know I’m getting better, but still not in shape to be dating. 

I finally decided to tell this guy, what I had been through. He told me how sorry he was for me, and how no one should have to go through what I have. 

I then heard him quietly say “Especially not you” 

It caught me by surprise and I wondered why he’d add that in. We are just friends after all.

Me (F22)and my bf (M21) are having issue with connection,"Me (22) and my bf (21) are having issue with connection

Me and my boyfriend have been having different views on time. 

He works a 8am to 5pm job. I work a 3pm to 11pm shift. He recently got this job- it pays him better than he has ever seen and I am so happy for him because it’s an automotive job (which he is a car enthusiast). I had my job first and it pays me alright as a woman that loves to help and working with people of disabilities. 

We have come to a pickle where, I’ll wake up in the morning and he’s gone for work. When he gets home, I’m at work already. Once I get off - he is already asleep. So I never get to talk about my day or visit with him Monday through Friday. On the weekends he expresses he needs to make time for family and friends. Which feels like to me he prioritizes first. 

I’ve asked to spend a bit more time together on weekends or little as play with my hair to help me sleep once getting home when I have my chronic migraines. He expresses he is being asked to much and I “nag” and I have no respect for his rest or life outside of me. I’ve tried to tone down and let things be what they are but then he says I’m detaching. He starts to not answer my texts through the day and distance himself when he sees I stop “nagging” because if “ I’m on that shit then he is too”.

He has been on the line of breaking up and so have I because it feels like we have “no time” for a relationship. But we both don’t want to be without each other. He has gotten emotional about the importance of each other  but he doesn’t make an effort???

Do I want this relationship more? and do I continue to detach to self prioritize or do I see this through to make a sacrifice for someone I love? 

He also likes to make time to work on his own project car which creates more of a distance between him and I. I am more introverted and don’t like to make useless friends and be friendly with acquaintances- but he does. So I am more available than him but I do it for a desire of him and valuable time together. 

TL;DR He makes me feel like I control him or want to posses him but I feel like I’m asking for almost the bare minimum? Am I being THAT girl?? I can’t ask close friends because they will do the “fuck him girl and move on” but I want HIM.",,,,,,,,
End my relationship or move on emotionally without telling/talking to my partner,"My partner and I are both late 20s, we've been together for a year and a half and 6 months of those are him being depressed/stressed/burned out. Besides that, even on days he is feeling more fine, he isn't sure if he wants to continue being with me regardless of his depression.

I am/was willing to wait for him, but it feels like he has SO much to deal with before even getting to the issues in our relationship. He'll often say he really can't take any more and the last thing he wants to be worrying about right now is us/our relationships/his feelings for me. 

To be honest I've forgotten the good times. How he treated me well, the fun we had. It's all a distant memory now. We barely talk and there is no more emotional closeness or romance. Objectively I wouldn't even call us friends from our interactions, more random acquaintances if anything. But we're still ""together"". 

I've talked to him about it a million times already and he'll just give me less than nothing every time. In the beginning him being distant and cold was so incredibly hurtful and confusing, I tried to understand it, be patient. Now I barely care anymore. When I see him there's still something there between us, I guess that's what's kept me hopeful up to this point.

Like I said I didn't mind waiting for him or supporting him through hard times. I can do without romance, intimacy. I love him. But I can't live like this, without any closeness, effort or interest. None. And I realized I can't be with someone who can turn cold on me like that, because communication means everything to me. 

Now I feel conflicted on whether or no to end it. I'm thinking more about how it will affect him. The last thing I want is to make him spiral and do the one thing he asked me not to. Maybe he doesn't care, I really don't know anymore. Just worried how he'll take it. 

I don't want to date other people either, want to still be his friend and support him. Basically nothing would change from the way it is now. Part of me thinks I should just move on/detach emotionally without really talking about it (part of me feels like he already did as well) and then when the biggest issues in his life are past him we can have that break up talk? 

Is that a horrible idea?

**tl;dr**: My partner has been depressed for 6 months and dealing with a lot of heavy things. We've basically not had any form of a relationship since. My romantic feelings are gone. I still want to be there for him and be his friend, but I don't want to add a breakup to the list of his worries right now. Is it okay for me to move on emotionally and have the breakup conversation later?",,,,,,,,
What does healthy accountability look like?,"A few weeks ago, I (38F) broke up with my partner (34M) of 7 months because he did something to me that I see as an unethical way to treat another person (particularly someone you profess to love). He says he deeply regrets hurting me but doesn’t agree it was unconscionable.

I haven’t seen him since then but we are catching up tonight to talk things through. I don’t think I would be open to reconciling but I do still care about him. Our lives are going to continue overlapping and I want relations between us to be as good as possible - emotionally resolved, I guess.

I grew up in a very codependent family and I have trouble identifying, setting and enforcing boundaries. I want to use this situation as practice. I am angry and hurt and feel betrayed, and I want to respect that part of me for once. 

What would it look like for him to be accountable for his actions in a healthy way? I don’t know what to accept as ‘satisfactory’. He’s already said he regrets hurting me; should I expect him to admit his behaviour was ‘wrong’? Should i expect him to be somehow making it up to me? 

(Note, yes I am emotionally prepared for him to raise grievances against me and I will take them seriously)

Tl;dr my (now ex-)partner did something shitty to me, over which I ended the relationship. What would healthy accountability from him look like?",,,,,,,,
"I (29F) have a choice to make, Harvey (32M) or Jake(24M)?","I met Jake 4 years ago in what some might call a “meet-cute”. We just happened to bump into each other and everything clicked. I have a previous post on here talking about my unending love for him and our crazy history. But here’s the Tl;dr: 
- 20 yo man meets 26 yo woman, we vibe 
- Frequent mind-blowing sex turns into a whirlwind relationship
- Pandemic brings us very close, codependent. We felt empty and uncomfortable when the other wasn’t around. Much love was had by all.
- Mania and drug/alcohol addiction on his side blows the relationship up in slow motion
- Both walk away absolutely destroyed

I couldn’t get over him for a long time, but because of the damage from the fallout of our breakup, I swore him off, and all men his age, and just… got on with my life. I guess I sort of fooled myself into thinking I was over him because of this swearing off. Not the same thing as moving on as I learned.

Another thing to note is that when it comes to financial/education/career matters, Jake and I are far from equally yoked. Jake has no education after high school, and he had a hard time holding down a job. When he had one it was always waiting tables. I work in tech, and I’m quickly approaching making 3 times as much as he used to as a waiter. He makes very little right now because he is unemployed, which I will explain more later.

I hit dating apps and I met Harvey. Like with Jake, we had a lot of fun together. He makes almost twice as much as me so it was a different kind of fun. The tables turned in a big way from Jake to Harvey. He’s very tall and attractive. That along with his income meant he could be selective in dating. He made me feel like Miss Right-Now instead of Miss Right a lot of the time. He could be very critical of both himself and others. He also had a bit of a drinking problem and when he got drunk, he would voice the things he wished were different about me. He said I had a pretty face but he wanted me to be thinner, and more muscular/athletic. He didn’t take much interest in my hobbies. He was a man who knew what he wanted who was disinterested in other things. The reason we broke up is because he “broke up” with me without actually meaning it 3 times. He often made me feel disposable and unimportant. 

With that said, he was very affectionate and cuddly. He was generous and always honest (to a fault sometimes). Harvey and I were best friends. I called him my twin flame. Separate we were candles burning bright but together we were a raging bonfire. Both in tech, we developed software together. He coached me to snag a huge raise and I coached him to develop a game. My favorite thing about him was that he was always growing and changing. He always wanted to be a better version of himself in the future, and I love that energy.

The sex wasn’t good. It was almost clinical. I had a much higher drive than him so I was always hungry for him but came away feeling a unsatisfied when he’d throw me a “bone” (lol). When we broke up, I was actively setting up appointments with a sex therapist to try and have more passion in our relationship.

When Harvey and I broke up, his world, his walls and ego, came crashing down. He didn’t realize until I was really gone how much I meant to him. He misses me terribly and would do anything to win me back.

After Harvey and I broke up I thought “I wonder how Jake has been?” I had wondered this many times but Harvey wasn’t comfortable with me making contact, and I respected that completely. I asked him once and never brought it up again. This time I could actually reach out and ask. Well as it turns out we never got over each other. It clicked just as easily as the first time.

Now I have 2 men that literally want to marry me. 

A few months ago Jake had a massive family tragedy and broke his 2 year sobriety until he started outpatient rehab. He just graduated and I believe he will have another job waiting tables or working in a nursing home in a couple weeks. He plans to start community college after that. The most important development for him is that he was diagnosed with bipolar 1 after we broke up and he has spent the last couple years perfecting his medication regimen with his doctor. The mania is under control. But he has a lot of catching up to do before he’s ready to settle down. He’s done the emotional work and now he has the financial work in front of him.

Harvey is the complete opposite. He has done all the financial work and he has a lot of emotional work in front of him. He’s doing the work too. He’s in an anger management group as well as he’s seeing a psychiatrist, his normal therapist, and a hypnosis specialist (?) He stopped drinking. He realizes his shortcomings and has been obsessively working on them.

I broke up with Harvey 2 months ago and reconnected with Jake 1 month ago. It is FAR too early to make a decision but ultimately I do think I will wind up spending my life with one of them. I know they will both wait unless I tell them explicitly there is no chance we will ever get back together. What should I look out for? On what do I base my decision? I feel like financial stability and intimate connection are both pretty important things for me in a partner. 

Is it wrong for me to be seeing Jake right now? We’ve limited our contact to 1/week phone calls and every 4th week we meet up in person. Still I wonder if it’s immoral. Would it be wrong for me to have a similarly distant relationship with Harvey at the same time?

I really want to do the right thing, both for myself and for each of these men that I really do love and care for deeply. Please don’t judge me too harshly.

Tl;dr - Two of my exes, Harvey and Jake, are both madly in love with me. Harvey is financially in a good place but he has some work to do on himself emotionally. Jake has done more emotional work and needs time to develop financial stability. How do I decide between them, and how should I conduct myself in the mean time to not string them along?",,,,,,,,
How do (M25) I talk to (F25) women at clubs and get them to dance with me?,"I’ve been clubbing for a few months now and the best part for me is when I can dance with a girl. The problem is that it seems a lot of women only want to dance with other women or their boyfriends if they came with one. It’s so crazy. I’ve seen random girls just get behind other girls and smack them on the butt or something and they just start smiling and dancing together. I’ve tried that a few times myself and it’s been hit or miss. I almost got cussed out one time and I got pushed another time. 

I don’t get it. If these women are straight then why wouldn’t they want to dance or grind with a guy. I don’t know if I should just keep trying to get behind girls or smack them on the butt but trying to ask them to dance always fails. I’ve never had it work when I tried to just be polite and ask for a dance. I guess women don’t think that’s confident.

Tl;dr I don’t know how to talk to women at clubs",,,,,,,,
Dealing with my grandmother.,"I am a SAHM, my husband and I have 4 children. My husband is a pipe welder. 

My husband goes to a lot of out of state jobs for turn arounds mostly during the spring and fall and can be gone anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months, sometimes longer if the job pays enough and has enough work. It's usually only twice a year that he is gone on these trips and is usually within a few hours drive it's rare that he is farther away that that. 

This is normal for us, we've been together for 12 years and he's been doing this for most of those years. He is gone currently, he left a few days ago and will be gone about 3 weeks or so. I can hold down the fort, it's fine. I am not in an unsafe area at all. We live in a farm community and I know every farmer around me. It is extremely rare that someone isn't coming over to borrow our tractor or the welder or buy eggs from me. Not to mention having random kids always running around with my kids and having their parents over. I'm rarely ever alone. However there is a road that is about a half mile away and if there isn't anything planted you can easily see into my yard and see if my husband's truck is there. 

The issue is every time my husband leaves my grandmother shows up and tries to spend the night or convince me that it's unsafe or whatever she comes up with to stay here. She isn't homeless she is just the type of person that is very manipulative and constantly needs to be all up in everyone's business. I have never once allowed her to stay. 

I cannot stand my grandmother, every thing is backhanded with her. She constantly has something rude to say about this or that with my home half the time she shows up here she is with a friend and expects me to put up my dogs that protect my chickens and goats or she will throw a fit because a chicken gets too close to her ( none of my animals are mean). It's just constantly something with her. She also constantly has something to say about my marriage but she's been married 7 times. She shouldn't be giving anyone marriage advice. 

She does this to everyone in the family but I was her ""favorite grandchild"".

I do not let my children alone with her because she is either going to manipulate them into giving her information on whoever is her target at the moment or she gets too touchy. Specifically the touchy thing, she used to force me to sleep in the bed with her when I was little and to this day it gives me severe anxiety that she may do that to one of my children. I do not trust her at all. 

She also has a lot to say about my children because I couldn't have biological children. She constantly reminds me that she birthed 6 children before she was 30 and asks me when I'm going to give her real grandchildren. The only time she pretends to love my children is when she brings her friend then they are her favorite great grandchildren and she likes to talk about everything they do and all of their accomplishments that she's never shown up for. This is really the only thing that infuriates me and she's learned not to let me hear anything she says about my children or to let me see her messing with my children. Everything else is just annoying but not infuriating. 

This has been years in the making and I've told her hundreds of times to stop, I'm not nice about it. I don't pretend it's okay. I stone wall her most of the time but nothing works with her. She simply keeps doing it. If I locked the gate she will simply park and walk and then throw a fit that I dare to lock the gate and she is in so much pain walking so far. If I force her to leave she throws a fit ( again she does this to everyone). 

I'm so sick of this. If my husband is home he normally curses her out and she huffs and leaves but I am not someone that can treat someone like that, I just can't. 

What should I do?

Tdlr- my grandmother is an awful person and I'm tired of dealing with her.",,,,,,,,
My (21f) mum (47f) is threatening to call social services on me and my boyfriend (22m) for having my sister (16f) over?,"Tldr; my sister isn’t allowed to meet with me but my mum because my mum hates me. I’m 32 weeks pregnant and she’s wanting to call social services on me?

To start we have a bad relationship because I remind her of my dad who she hates. He was a criminal and I went off the rails as a teenager causing her to hate me even more.

She’s with my step dad who’s my sisters father and my sisters amazing and even my step dads better than my mum. 

I moved out at 16 and lived with my boyfriend and his step dad. It was the first time I felt like I belonged in a family and we had a great time. We were both pretty messed up at the time but his step dad was well nice and helped us through. We both now have jobs and yes we don’t have the most money but my boyfriend got lucky for a job with no degree and we live together in our own small house and are expecting our son soon. We’ve gotten our lives together and are happy and in love.

I’ve been getting in touch with my sister recently as she’s old enough to go places without our mum now and it’s been great. I’ve loved talking to her and she’s told me I’m not how she expected as my mums set her against me. She’s tried to instil classist views on my sister that poor people are violent and unhappy. I’ve proved that untrue. She came to mine and my boyfriend’s house and my mum followed her by tracking her phone. My mum let herself in because I hadn’t locked the door, she shouted at me, shouted at my sister, called me a danger to children, told me I shouldn’t be having children and she’d call social services. My boyfriend heard this so he came into the room shouted at her and told her to get out or he’d call the police. She left and I just started crying and I’m now scared she’ll find a way to take my son away from me. I don’t know how to cope so I’m giving Reddit a try?",,,,,,,,
M(29) F(26),"Girlfriend doesn't like dancing with me.

Hello I have a girlfriend that I have been with for a out 4 months now.. she has been dancing with her male friend for years at a country dance salon. Now I knew that when she told me and said it was fine. Since we started as bf and gf I thought well she can dance with me and her male friend like a 50/50 where she still gets to dance with her male friend but also dance with me her boyfriend evenly. I didn't think that was asking to much or being unfair. 

But when I told her she started crying acting like I told her she couldn't dance or hangout with her friend anymore. She told me that, going to the country salon dance hall was her and her friends thing and she didn't want it to become a thing with me and her. She would get mad when she danced with me more then him. She told me that she doesn't get excited when I go and have to dance with her because she gets less dancing time with her friend. The one time we went by ourself without him she was not excited at all and just wanted to sit down.  would tell her let's go dance and she would say no, until iI convinced her to dance and even then I could tell she was not enjoying it at all.. Am I in the wrong for getting mad and upset? She said she was being selfish and doesn't care. I told her well I just won't go with her anymore so she could dance with her friend and she started crying?? I thought that's what she wanted?? I offered to take country dance classes so I could get better but she said thanks for the effort but no thanks. Now of course I got hurt after hearing her say that doesn't want to dance with me at all and while trying to put effort into learning to dance better but she pretty much said even if you got better at dancing I still would not dance with you, and much rather dance with her friends. 

TL;DR: Is there something I'm missing? I need outside opinions please. Other then the dancing part everything else is fine.

Thanks",,,,,,,,
I[M23] developed incredibly serious feelings to me FWB[F31],"It started about one year ago when we were at a company delegation during a party. Both of us are smokers then we had a lot of opportunities to talk together. When we went out last time at the end of the party, she asked me to bring her to the hotel room. When we went there, I don't exactly know how it happened, because I was drunk but become from the goodbye kiss, we started kissing and then had sex.

I felt awkard after this, but she explained me that was just sex, and nothing bad. We were pretending that nothing had happened. After few weeks, she invited me to her home. I was extremely excited about this, I visited her, and we had a lot of sex. We have had very much of metings like this.

The point here is our physical relationship with a her made me develop incredibly serious feelings to her. I have 23 years and she 31. Should I tell her about what I feel?

Me(20M) and a “friend”(20F) are falling away from each other,"Me(20 M) and a friend(20 F) started talking back in September of ‘22. Things started to pick up gradually between her and I. We both agreed on the “3 month rule,” (basically you stay in the talking stage for three months to see if you get along well, also it is known that people start to show their true selves after about 3 months of dating) our three months would have been in early December. The day before our three months was over she tells me we should go back to being friends for a while, although she never told me why. I didn’t sleep for two days because I was trying to think of every possible scenario where I might have done something wrong. About two weeks later we are hanging and being just friends, I take the opportunity to ask why. She responded with, “I am dealing with a lot of mental issues right now, I get manic out of nowhere and I don’t want to take my episodes out on you.” When I heard that I automatically thought the classic “it’s not you it’s me” bs that people like to pull in order to not hurt your feelings. She assured me that she was being truthful and she just needs time to herself for a while but that we could still be friends. 

Now I understand having mental issues and them causing the end of relationships and friendship’s because my sister was the same way. I went along with it, now there have been at least 4 times that I can think of that her and I would be hanging out and she does things to get “close” to me(putting her head on my chest, giving me the “I want you smirk,” etc.) and I know that’s what she was doing because she’d admit to it. On top of all of this we have been in two major arguments in the past 3 months because I have always done something wrong, but anytime I mentioned something she did that hurt or upset me she’d excuse it or dodge the topic and blow it off. I still have feeling for her and care about her even after everything, but I feel like the best thing for me and her both is to distance ourselves from each other. What do you guys think?(there is a lot more info to this than what I posted so I can answer any questions in the comments)
TL;DR- Girl and had a relationship, she cut it short without telling me why.",,,,,,,,

I'm (M17) losing my Girlfriend (F16) and I can't handle it,"My Girlfriend confessed to me last night that she doesn't think that she loves me anymore and that she has wanted to break up for a while, she also told me that she doesn't find me attractive anymore. This has broken me and I am currently at the lowest point that I have ever been and I need you all to help me as best you can.

My Girlfriend has always been a fiery and strong willed Individual, so much so that I had to fight to get certain things to change that she did during our Relationship because they seriously bothered me and affected me mentally. Things like how she sleeps nude in a house where her entire family walks into her room whenever they want at any time and pull the covers off of her and walk in on her changing clothes without intention to do so but nonetheless it has happened.

During our Relationship we have had arguments and fights about many things. I made her sleep in at-least her bra and pants, I made her wrap her towel around her completely whenever she got out of the shower as she would crookedly hold the towel over her back which left her entire front exposed and she would walk around like that. I made her understand that I will never permit her to have Guy friends because I know of their nature and what would most likely happen between them. I also made her stop using TikTok because of the amount of Pornographic Content on there that would appear on both mine and her FYP's, we both stopped using it.

I have always been Insecure about myself and my body and due to this Insecurity I have made Rules but I have always made sure to not be extreme and try to make things as easy for her, but she has told me how she hates not having her freedom and said that she's sick of it. At first when she originally told me this I made changes and tried to be more lenient but asked her to be respectful of me and how I feel which she pretty much didn't and it really fucked me up.

Last night I wanted to speak to her after not talking to her since the night prior since I had to sleep early for a Driving Test I had early today to get my Licence to drive to see her. To which she told me she's playing with her friend instead of wanting to spend time with me, I then asked her why she isn't interested about my Day and why she doesn't want to hear how it went because I had good news to tell her (I passed my test).

She then proceeded to ask me to ""fuck off"" when I asked her why she thinks it's okay to prioritise her friend that she doesn't even know over me during something important. After her telling me that she just doesn't care I was deeply hurt and decided to lay down and just clear my head, and then I decided to check who she was playing with and it turns out it was a guy who she knew for a while before meeting me and I'm almost certain they had a history of flirting/relationship.

She had lied to me about who she was playing with and purposely hid the fact that the person she was prioritising me over was a guy and she instead wanted to voice call with him and play with him instead of me, this completely destroyed my trust and hit me like a freight train. I then confronted her and that's when she told me she doesn't think that she loves me anymore and thinks I'm not attractive anymore.

We haven't actually broken up yet, last night she told me that she wants to break up and be single again and to which I asked if we could try and change things up to see if there's still things left because if it's going to end with her leaving me then I want to try regardless and she responded saying she's not sure.

Please can you all help me out, I poured my soul into our relationship and losing her would be the worst thing imaginable for me right now. Please give me your advice and thank you for reading.

Am I[F22] the one in the wrong for dating a guy[M21] that one of my mutuals[F21] from High-school dated for a long time?,"My boyfriend has an ex who openly hates me. Her and I used to be mutuals on social media because we went to the same HS. We never interacted irl, would only occasionally hype eachother up on IG, and our only notable interaction is when we both ranted about our exes together on IG dm, because we just so happened to be going through breakups at the same time. Her ex now being my boyfriend. I did not know her ex, only by name, never interacted with him before, and only met him at a party 3 months later through mutual friends. We just ended up really liking eachother. 

After word got out, she sent me a hateful message on instagram calling me a b!tch and saying karma is gonna get me and I’m a snake in the grass. Okay. I’ll take it. I responded saying “I’m sorry, I had no intentions of this happening, and I’d probably be just as upset as you”. Nothing else was said. My boyfriend then took it into his own hands to say something to her along the lines of “hey man, relax, live and let live”. Verbatim, live and let live. Remember that. 

So it’s now been a year+ of us being together, have not heard anything from her since. Up until last week. He got a notification that his ex liked his photo on instagram. They do not follow eachother, so clearly she was doing some snooping and liked his post about him and his accomplishments at culinary school. He told me it made him uncomfortable, and he blocked her. We both maturely discussed it, and chalked it up to her seeing he’s doing good and wanted to show some love. But me being me, I decided to look at her twitter to see if I could find out more. Low and behold, her most recent tweet said “Getting hard to live and let live out here babes”. Directly quoting the last thing he said to her. That cannot be a coincidence, since it was tweeted right after she liked his photo. I did more of a twitter deep dive - she clearly misses him and is still upset. 

Anyways, I have a TikTok, with quite a few followers, and I decided to make a post joking about how “my bf’s ex liked his picture”. Immature, sure. But no harmful intentions. I’m a young woman who’s audience is young women, so I figured it would be relatable &amp; funny. No names were dropped. Got a couple likes and laughs. The next day, I get a comment from someone I do not know saying “no one wants his abusive good for nothing ass” referring to my boyfriend. This comment came from a friend of hers. Abuse is a serious allegation, and although I do not know what exactly happened in their relationship, I do know there was cheating done on both parts, and he just pretty much did not show up for her the way she wanted him to. He has never said one negative thing about his ex, and seems to fully take accountability for being a dumbass. Teenage immaturity it seems, since they dated all through out high school. And their most recent breakup was mutual, btw. 

My boyfriend has not shown any abusive tendencies in the year+ we’ve been together. I have been in abusive relationships. He is not an abuser. So I took it into my hands to reach out to her and ask her not to send people over to my social media to make allegations like that. I also said how she’s tweeting about missing him, liking his picture, meanwhile sending her minions out to say he’s an abuser. She then responded basically telling me I’m the reason she is suffering and that I “play the victim on the internet” but that “I know what I did to her” in reference to dating her ex 4 months after they broke up. She also says she doesn’t use social media but some how my stuff always ends up being sent to her… like why do you have people looking at my accounts for you? I really cannot tell if I am the one in the wrong or if she is now dragging it out way too much and is causing problems. Any advice or input? I’m willing to take any feedback, lol. 

TL;DR- my boyfriends ex hates me for dating him and is now sending people to call him an abuser on my social media, meanwhile she tweets about missing him and likes his instagram posts.",,,,,,,,
How do I (24M) have a productive conversation with my gf (24F) about her finances when she struggles to do difficult things?,"Tl;Dr gf is in a bad financial place with jobs, I’m in a good spot, and I don’t know how to give her advice because she has a hard time doing difficult things


Met a year ago. We don’t live together. We don’t have shared finances. I’m currently 3 hours away doing an internship where I’m making $30/hr and don’t have rent. She works at a preschool making $14.50. I’m in a comfortable financial situation in terms of habits, awareness, and savings. She has next to no savings, lives paycheck to paycheck, and is constantly in a stressful financial situation anytime an unexpected expense comes up or she has to miss work. 

Her current pickle is that her family has a trip to her dads home country, and her work said they can’t give her the 11 days off, even though she requested it 3 months in advance. When she was told she can’t have the time off, she said “okay, I won’t go then. I can’t really afford to miss that much work anyways.”  (Also side note: it seems like she was denied having these dates off because “too many people had requested it off” but then found out later someone else was given the same time off after he request was denied). Her mom said that she has to go, the plane tickets are already bought; that if my gf doesn’t go, she owes her mom $1000 for the ticket (which is a bit silly because her parents are wealthy; $1k is pocket change to them, but it’s more than my gf’s rent) So my gf was trying to figure out what to do for weeks, and kept putting off talking to her boss about how she’s in a tough spot and needs to take the time off (she said she would send an email explaining that if she can’t get the time off she would have to quit to avoid owing her mom $1000; she procrastinated sending the email for weeks and it’s still not sent) 

Long story short, her mom finally said that my gf can go or not go, it doesn’t matter, and she won’t owe any money for the ticket. 

So that weight is off her shoulders a bit, but all of this made her realize how shitty her job is (she loves the work, loves the kids, but the pay isn’t good, and the fact that she has such a struggle with her boss regarding time off (another side note: my gf gets sick semi regularly due to being around kids, and last time she could hardly breathe and didn’t want to get the kids sick and she called in to work, the boss asked her what her symptoms were and trying to convince her to come in because they didn’t have enough people), so even though she’s off the hook with this trip as far as the ticket goes, she still feels she needs to find a different job; and she still can’t afford to take nearly 2 weeks off from work, not to mention she’ll probably have to pay for stuff on the trip itself like food and whatnot. 

It’s worth mentioning that my gf has an incredibly hard time doing difficult things. I don’t know anything about adhd, but she says that’s the cause. She stopped going to school after about a year and says she’s “bad at school” and doesn’t want to go back. She refuses to do any budgeting (she says “my system works for me”; yet for example she had a $17 subscription she’s been paying for since 2021 that she just saw, so clearly she’s not very aware of her finances). She’s had, in the year I’ve known her, probably 5 different “oh shit, i can afford gas or groceries or bills, but not all three” moments. One time her parents had to help her pay for stuff. Yet each time these moments occur, she doesn’t make any major changes to avoid it happening the next time. She’s talked about getting a new job when these things happen, but then doesn’t continue. She says she can’t handle a desk job, but knows that the type of job she has now (interacting with kids) doesn’t pay enough. In essence, she’s constantly in a tight spot financially but each time she gets out of it, continues on in more or less the same way. 

So we plan on talking about this trip dilemma later today on the phone because she’s really not sure what to do. I really don’t know what to tell her. My advice each time she’s in a tough spot is essentially to suck it up, research good paying jobs she could go to school for, humble herself and ask her parents to help support her in this journey by paying for school or letting her move back in or something (I think this could work because her dad has quite literally told her that she needs to try harder; it’s clear he wants effort out of her above all else; he has savings for both of his children, im sure he would be okay with her using that for improving her situation by getting an education). I say this a bit more diplomatically to her but this is putting it all bluntly. I see school as the best long term avenue (although it doesn’t solve her immediate crisis, but that fact that she has crises all the time means something needs to be done), but I’m also biased towards school because that’s what has led me to the place where I’m at, which is quite comfortable. I also encourage her to start budgeting, to become aware of her finances. But she refuses. 

I’m not sure what I can say to her when we discuss this later. All the options suck for various reasons because every time she had reason in the past to make a change, she refused to.",,,,,,,,
I (25m) am confused after coworker (21f) showing strong interest for a bit then act indifferent,"
So there’s this girl at work (21F) which I (25M) clicked with right away when we first met. We’re talking here and there but nothing special going on. Few months go by, I suddenly develop strong feelings for this girl. It was quite sudden and intense. At one point it got so intense I decided to tell her about it - she turned me down. 

No big deal, then we keep talking like normal, but now we gradually start talking even more and get closer in the process. We’re both rather fun in nature, we just have fun in the boring workplace. However, I am no longer going in with any romantic intent/expectation. She’s just a cool person at work that I like to talk to and with whom we have many things to talk about and whom I have interest to get to know better (as a person). 

Then few months later, suddenly out of nowhere she began showing a strong interest in me for about 2 weeks, perhaps 3. I was riding the wave and enjoying the ride, but I also started developing those strong and intense feelings from before, again. I fell quick and I fell hard. But after those 2-3 weeks, she started to, not slowly but rather quickly, by the day, show less and less interest and attraction, and now we don’t really talk anymore at all. But those 2 weeks felt so so real, it felt like teenagers being in love in high school. It felt so real 

Whole thing threw me quite off guard really, but the thing that annoys me the most is I have no idea why that last bit happened. And how should I best proceed from the current situation? I am aware that this person(or soul) has some really really special role in my life, I just can’t quite figure it out, and this I am confused about my next move(s) and general direction even. I would much appreciate some guidance/advice.


TL;DR - Fell for a girl at work. Told her about it, she turned me down. No big deal. We kept talking, I no longer had romantic expectations or intentions. We start talking more and we get closer, then she suddenly began showing strong interest for 2-3 weeks then suddenly began acting completely indifferent - now we don’t really talk anymore. Idk how to interpret the whole thing, *especially* that last bit.",,,,,,,,

My (24F) ex-situationship (23M) sent me an unsolicited half-naked video. Do I tell my current boyfriend (26M)?,"I've been with my boyfriend for a little over 2 years. We live together, have a strong bond, and I love him very much and have no interest in anybody else. 

This morning, I woke up to a snapchat from an old flame I 'dated' (rather, it was more like a situationship, no title, but it was the most traumatic romantic and sexual connection I've ever experienced.) We are not even friends on the app and never were so I don't know how he found me. I debated whether to even open it but curiosity got the best of me, as he hasn't reached out a single time in the 3 years we've been broken up, despite sliding me requests on social media that I've declined. I wondered what he could possibly be saying.

The snap turned out to be a video of him shirtless, flexing and making what I guess were supposed to be seductive faces. There was no caption, not even a greeting. I felt violated, did not respond, and immediately blocked him.

The problem is I feel guilty for having even opened it despite doing nothing else wrong. In addition to that, I've been feeling on edge  because, even though this was not nearly as extreme, that kind of agressive sexual behavior is exactly what traumatized me in our past connection. I'm torn about whether to tell my boyfriend or not, because on one hand, the snap made me uncomfortable and he is my committed partner and confidant, but on the other hand, I didn't entertain my ex at all and don't want to put any unnecessary worries in my boyfriend's head. 

TLDR: Ex-flame sent me a semi-nude video unsolicited, I didn't entertain it and blocked him. Should I still tell my current boyfriend or not?",,,,,,,,

Anyways, T’s ex (20m) and him are still good friends and they keep in touch through stuff like discord and Snapchat because they live in different states. T broke it off about a year ago (might’ve been longer idk the exact timeframe they’ve dated), and T and I started becoming “more than friends” around September/October having met in July. Anyways, the two of them sometimes still voice call and overall hang out on discord, except when he brings it up like “I called with (ex’s name) this entire morning” when I ask what he did, I can’t help but feel self conscious. I feel guilty for feeling this way since we aren’t even official a couple. What really bugs me though is T does stuff with his ex he doesn’t want to do with me, like watch movies over a discord call. When I propose we maybe watch something, he is always reluctant. Granted, we live close to one another and see each other a few times a week. 

Am I wrong to feel jealous, and how can I stop feeling this way? Also, I am quite certain there are no more romantic feelings between the two of them, they just have a good friendship bc T helped his ex through a buncha trauma like he’s helping me rn. 

I don’t know how to bring up my concerns to him because I don’t want to seem controlling, but I guess it really affects me mentally sometimes (especially that he does stuff with his ex he doesn’t do with me). Like I said though, we watch movies in person together and hang out in person often and I know his ex realistically doesn’t even pose any risk to our relationship cause T is the one who broke things off. 

TLDR: feel self conscious and jealous of my kinda bf’s ex even though they’re just good friends",,,,,,,,
"26F found out my boyfriend, 23M was cheating on me after being together for over 1 year in the most unbelievable way","I, female (26) and my boyfriend male (23) were in a serious, committed, and exclusive relationship for over 1 year. 

We started talking in 2019 when he was (20) and I was (22). And at the time he wasn't interested in marriage so we didn't continue to talk. However in 2022, we reconnected and this time he said he was serious and ready for marriage and stated that he wanted to get to know me for the purpose of marriage. 

We are both Muslim, Pakistani, and raised in the GTA. 

On March 14, 2023 I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. 

The way I found out sounds almost unbelievable. 

He came from the University of Toronto (Mississauga campus) to pick me up from my place after I finished work and we went to the McDonald's near my house. 

We were at McDonald's sitting at one of the booths drinking our iced coffees. A little boy named David started playing peek-a-boo with me behind my boyfriend's side of the booth. 

After a while of playing my boyfriend seemed visibly annoyed with the little boy. I found the little boy very cute so I asked if he wanted to sit with us for a bit. He sat next to us and was such a sweet kid. He later returned back to his table behind my boyfriend's side of the booth. He peeked over again to play peekaboo. However, this time David looked shocked. He said miss, miss, he's looking at pictures of other girls. 

And I laughed and said what? And he said yah he's looking at pictures of other girls that aren't you! I turned to my boyfriend. David came back and sat next to us. And I asked him can I see your phone? And he said the kid is lying. I said okay lol. And then David replied miss I'm not lying, he is! I said, honestly you know that children don't lie. Can I see your phone? And so after a long hesitation he handed me his phone. On his snapchat I saw a few women snapping him constantly. Maybe 100s of snaps in the last 24 hours. So I opened one and it's pictures of a naked girl. I kept opening them and it was more and more explicit pictures of the same girl. 

I opened other snaps he was sent and it was the same thing but different girls. When I showed him his phone and said dude wtf? Who are these girls. He replied and laughed and said no dw it's just porn, probably a bot account. I replied saying that you added on Snapchat? And he said yah they requested me and I followed them back. I said but you're saving all the videos she sends you? And he said yah so I can watch them later y'know. I asked him, do you think that I would think that's okay?? He was silent. 

I had a random gut feeling and asked him to show me his Instagram account. And he said no. I said why. He said I deleted it. I said redownload it. Redownload it rn. I took his phone and downloaded it and made him sign in. After a lot of hesitation he signed in. 

I don't have Instagram. I've never made one. I'm not sure how to navigate the app. I asked him where are the DMs? And he pointed at the arrow, I opened them. I was shocked. He wasn't just talking to 1 or 2 girls. So many girls in the GTA. He was messaging them first. He was asking them to hangout. He was meeting them at their house. He legit met one girl the same day he saw me and rushed me that he needed to go? He met with girls while I was here in the GTA and when I attended a destination wedding in Thailand. He was talking to these girls while we were in a serious, committed, exclusive relationship. 

I asked him why? What did you do with these other girls? And when he said nothing. I asked him. Did you meet up with them? He said yes. I asked him again. What did you do with them? And he replied nothing. He even tried to gaslight me that it's not that big of a deal because it happened a couple of months ago? 

I wasn't having any of that and that's when I realized he's not going to tell me the truth. 

So I took his phone and walked outside of McDonald's and proceeded to walk home which was about a 25 minute walk in -3 degrees Celsius without a jacket. He followed me. He kept saying can we please talk! And I kept calling him an a******. He ran back to his car. And then continued to follow me in his car shouting my name and asking can we please talk? 

I called my brother. I told him it's an emergency and to come pick me up from the street I was walking on. He came within a few mins of me calling him. My boyfriend saw my brother pull up and so he sped off and ended up going to his evening class at the University of Toronto (commuted from the Mississauga campus to the Toronto campus). 

I proceeded to call his older brother (he's an Imaam or like an Islamic priest) on my boyfriend's phone and tell him everything that happened. I was really distressed so I was basically just screaming that he's cheating on me and we're supposed to introduce parents soon and continue marriage talks in May??? His brother apologized on his behalf. I ended up hanging up. 

I had plans with my friends to go to the movies after work. So outside my house my friend was waiting in the car. I left my brother's car and went into her car. We drove to the movie theaters (Winston Churchill Cineplex) to meet up with my other friend. And we were returned our movie tickets. 

We ended up going back and forth between Oakville and Mississauga. 

And I decided I'm going to go to his house and tell his parents what he did. He lives in Ancaster which is so far out but my friends were willing to drive me. 

I have never met his parents. He is scared of his parents. And I knew that. He has never told his parents about me. He had only recently told his brother that he wanted to marry me and needed his help to tell their parents. 

So I drove with my friends to his house and ended up conversing with his family about what he did. They asked me so many questions about myself and what I was doing here and what I want in terms of next steps. They wanted to confirm with me that I no longer want to be in a relationship with him. They advised me that I shouldn't be with someone that behaves this way. We left from their home and drove back to Mississauga and I was dropped off at my place. 

When I got home I realized because I had his phone. He was emailing me the entire time asking to meet up to talk. 

However, in person earlier when I asked him why he did it, his only response was I thought we were going to break up in December so I didn't think it mattered anymore? When I asked them why the f*** would you think we were going to break up in December? We were so good? Like he was buying me flowers. We were going on dates? We were seeing each other frequently and talking all day. 

And it's because in December he came clean to me about lying from the start of our relationship. He lied that he was going to graduate in December, 2022. The reason that lie is significant is because when we were getting into a relationship i didn't want to date someone who wasn't done university and wasn't currently working. FYI - I have three university degrees: two undergraduate degrees and my Masters and I work full-time. However he told me he had a plan, and he was on track to graduate by December and he should have a job by then as well. 

However, he was failing all his courses. And in 2022, only passed 1 course out of all the courses he took. So he was well aware he wasn't graduating. Yet he continued talking about proceeding towards marriage. We even went engagement ring shopping. And so he thought when he came clean and told me the truth about lying about his grades and graduation I would just break up with him. Because it would take a long time for him to graduate and he still wouldn't have a job in our initial agreed upon timeline. 

However, I forgave him because I saw how genuinely and deeply sorry he was for lying to me about his grades and graduation. I guess he didn't anticipate for me to forgive him? That still doesn't give him the right to engage in romantic conversations and sexual activity with other women because he is planning to break up with me anyways in December. So it's okay to cheat from Sept - Nov. Like I'm not in the know. I am not aware. I had no clue. So I don't think it's justified but that's how he justified it to himself. 

For me - cheating is unforgivable. 
To him - telling his parents or even going to his house was unforgivable. 

He crossed my boundaries and so I crossed his. 
Because clearly he lacks the capacity to empathize with me. At this point with all the lying and the cheating, what more does he want me to endure? Like you pushed back all our timelines? Our future is very uncertain right now. It's all dependent on whether or not you get your s*** together. And genuinely I've been helping him through everything. With assignments, work applications, being a source of encouragement, and literally being his best friend. 

He also had so many opportunities to come clean to me in December. I even told him if you've been lying about anything else or if you've been cheating on me cuz usually lying and cheating go hand in hand. Please tell me now and I'm willing to forgive everything and we can move forward. 

And he said no. I promise that's the only thing that I lied about. And I said okay we can continue our relationship. 

I wanted input on the following: 
I don't know if what I did was okay. 

My friends are telling me that: 
1. He had clear intentions of cheating on me. 
2. He planned it by messaging other girls and meeting up with them. 
3. His motive was sexual in nature.

And all of that is unforgivable and it's not a mistake that just happened once. 

My brother still has his phone. His parents are coming to pick up his phone today from my house. Because they want evidence of what type of sexual activities he was engaging in.  

I don't know what's going to happen to him because I know he comes from a very strict religious family. 

I noticed both his cell phone lines (US and CAN) were cut off. 

I'm going through mental turmoil. 

I literally hate him and I can't forgive him. At the same time I never got any closure or any real understanding why this happened. 

I can't sleep, I haven't eaten anything since Monday night, I'm not able to focus at work, and my mind is scattered, and I feel betrayed and heart broken. 

I'm lost.


TLDR: summary here

My boyfriend and I dated for over one year. He comes from a strict Muslim family. He cheated on me a couple days ago. I took his phone. I ended up going to his house and telling his family. I still have his phone. His parents are going to come pick up his phone soon. I don't know what's going to happen to him and I don't know if what I did is wrong. I got absolutely no closure.",,,,,,,,
Is my friend fake or am I?,"
I (31-F) recently realized my best friend (33-F) wants everything that I have and I’m not sure what is bothering me so much about this.
She’s a great friend and is really supportive of everything that I do, she’s present and lovely to be around and has helped me through a lot, but whenever I have a new gig aligned; mentorships I start doing; life paths to be choosing etc, she wants in on it too and is very upfront about this.
I was already somewhat bothered every time I started a new gig and she would ask me to refer her right on my first week, because of the timing of things, but now what’s been bothering me even more is the fact that not only is she really good at everything I start doing, she doesn’t exactly “share” with me or think of referring me so we could work on things together either.
It sometimes feels like a one-sided collaboration and this makes me really sad. 

I don’t know how to talk about this with her in a positive way, and don’t even know if I should, but it has been bothering me for the longest time and I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR! - I don’t know if I’m being a crap friend",,,,,,,,
Should I (25F) keep talking to my ex hookup's (26M) close friend (26M) or leave the situation altogether?,"I have this friend that l've hooked up twice with, one sort of recently &amp; It was never anything serious. While we've only actually ever hooked up twice, we have made multiple plans to hook up. A few times, I realized that he was secretly in a relationship and was contemplating cheating on his girlfriend with me. We were supposed to get together recently and it happened that it never came to fruition. I guess he must've gotten another girlfriend, so he's fallen back for now. 


NOW, he has a guy friend (also 26 M) that has been interested in me and we even talked a few years back, before I knew they were friends, and things just never went anywhere. We just started talking again and he's a great guy, but there's a voice in the back of my head saying that I would be wrong for starting something with this guy since l've slept with one of his good friends. 


Guy A and I hooked up long before Guy B was in the picture, but it still feels like I'm messing with ""Guy Code."" If things get serious with Guy B, I do plan on telling him, but is that too late? Should I tell him now? Should I even be entertaining him knowing that l've been intimate with his close friend? Am I overthinking this whole thing? HELP. Thank you for any advice. 


TLDR;

My (25f) bf (25m) keeps putting me down everyday and making me feel bad about myself,"He calls me everyday to say I'm doing nothing with myself and I'm not doing enough regarding getting a job (i'm currently unemployed after quitting my toxic job) when i'm literally doing my best l've had two interviews already and I'm looking for jobs everyday but he says l'm doing nothing since I sit at home all day and don't go out asking places if they are hiring. He threatens me and says this won't work out and he will leave me if I don't get a job. Makes me feel bad to the point I start crying and get called dumb for crying. After my two interviews he asked me what I told them in interviews and said I'm not saying the ""right words"" to get the job. Idk what to do anymore at this point. I'm depressed and told him this and he basically says ""get over it you have to work quit acting like a child.""

"He said he doesn't feel a ""spark"" is it a bad idea to date casually?","I (28F) started recently getting to know a long time friend (32M) more and we've been casually dating for just over 3 months. He's a great guy &amp; he treats me well &amp; we are good friends together. I decided we needed to have the DTR convo because I was starting to notice myself catching feelings. He basically told me that he really likes me, enjoyed spending time with me, &amp; could continue to date casually for a while, but that if there was ever a time that I wanted to commit he couldn't do that because there was just
""something missing"" for him. Essentially I can be “Ms. Right Now"", but never ""Mrs. Right"" for him (not his words, but that's basically what I gathered).

I don't want anything serious (marriage, living together, kids, etc) right now either, but I also don't want to make the mistake of ""wasting time"" on a relationship that will never be more than casual. However, there is a part of me that believes even though I know it will end, it still will be fun and I will gain experience and deeper interpersonal skills. Especially since I'm still somewhat healing from my last long term relationship. 

I'm looking for advice/experience on navigating a casual relationship with someone who has made it clear they don't see themselves long term or taking next steps. The good and bad. 

TL;DR: I’m dating a guy who doesn’t see a future with me even though he likes me. Should I keep dating him casually or end things?",,,,,,,,
You say we’re just friends,"You say we’re just friends

We started when you were already with someone. But we were just kids. And we were friends. Really, truly, just friends. I never thought I’d ever think of you like that. We just talked on the phone one night. And we just clicked. I found myself telling you about random things and we just kept talking. But we were definitely just friends. I liked someone else and you were dating someone else so we were really just friends. Then we got closer. We started talking a lot more and your girlfriend (who I used to be friends with and who I even encouraged to date you) suddenly had a problem with me. And I thought she was crazy? I would never like you like that. You weren’t my type at all and I liked someone else a lot. But then idk what happened. Really slowly and really gradually you just crept into my life. You were suddenly a part of my everyday. We just *clicked*. There’s no other way to describe it. We became so close, closer than any other friend I had. We had secret conversations and we thought no one else would ever understand us. We were unique. We were *different*. We were us. We were just kids but you were the first person I said “i love you” to (even though you said it first and all I replied was a polite thankyou). We became so close that you were the only person I liked taking to. I told you everything and you told me things you’d never told anyone before. You eventually broke up with your girlfriend (I thought I had nothing to do with that but she still blames me for it). When high school ended and my plans for my dream college shattered (couldn’t afford it and had to go to a cheaper school closer to home), you were there for me. You stayed here when all my friends moved far away. You were my constant support system. We met almost everyday. We were still friends but we started crossing some lines. Friends don’t usually say “I love you” every night. Friends don’t usually sleep on FaceTime or on the phone. Friends don’t usually hold hands and linger too long for hugs. Then my life hit rock bottom and you were the only one there for me. Friends don’t usually have phone sex. But at that point, we’d crossed enough lines that this felt natural. It felt comforting. We always said we’re friends. But we were “best friends”. We made promises of forever. We said we’d always love each other more than anyone else. You were mine. I was yours. 

I stayed in that rock bottom phase of my life and you were my life boat. But you had to move to the opposite side of the country. We still made promises of how it’d work. Long distance friendships work. It worked for 8 months. Phone sex and sleeping on the phone lasted 8 months. Then you found someone. You started dating her. My heart shattered into a million pieces and I can’t explain why. Or maybe I can. I just don’t want to. It breaks my heart that you’re dating someone. I know we were just friends but You were mine. Only mine. Idk what to do now. 


You say we’re “friends”. But this was more than friendship. I just don’t know what to say now. Or how to say it. So I’ll cry myself to sleep.

Tldr: Friendship situationship is now breaking my heart once the guy is moving on",,,,,,,,
"Am I wrong 22F wanting to go somewhere cheap for my B-day, but my BF 20M wants to take me out somewhere expensive","

My birthday is coming up, and we had original plans to go to a fine dining restraunt, but some financial things has happened and kinda scrapped that plan, but he still wants to take me out to something that fine dining, but not expensive, but a little pricer than other restraunt. 

I keep to suggesting that we shouldn't go and save money and just stay home, but I felt like I pushed it too much and now he said its annoying about me not wanting to go out.

"BF lied for 6 months about seeing another woman, should I let it go?","Alright. So me (19 f) and my bf (20 m) have been dating for close to 3 years. We have had our fair share of issues as any relationship does. But in October of last year, we decided to go on a break because we were having some major issues that arose from his dealing with legal matters. He was very stressed out, and naturally, I wanted to be there for him and offer any support that I could. Throughout the break, we were still in contact occasionally, and I asked him often about the situation but at some point, he stopped sharing the details with me and said that I couldn't understand what he was going through. He began to act very secretively, whereas before we shared everything with each other. After finally realizing I should just give him space, I stopped asking. I'm a college student and I felt I should just focus on my studies. From there, his legal problems were resolved and honestly had the best possible outcome. We began talking again and got back together. Fast forward to about a week ago, he finally admitted to me that during that break he had slept with another woman. He says he knows this woman from the past. She got a boyfriend soon after they had sex so it was a short-lived situation. I was absolutely crushed and still am. We talked about it, his story is that she made the first move, and he never intended for it to go there and that it was a very unfulfilling experience. My main concern was the fact that he lied for so long about it. To date, he still has no explanation for lying for so long. He has promised to be better and to cut out the lying behavior. It seemed genuine, but I could just be blinded because I'm still very much in love with him. It just really hurts that he could lie for that long. It makes me question my worth and the last 6 months of this relationship as a whole. So, my main question is, should I attempt to continue this relationship and rebuild trust?

New relationship (m28) and (f29),"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 months and it’s been amazing. I dated an abusive and toxic ex for 8 years before. So this relationship has been completely the opposite. We haven’t had any big fights and there’s plenty of communication, honesty, etc. 

There’s one small problem and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. At first it was fine and I’d joke back. However, it’s beginning to bother me. My boyfriend has a habit of constantly responding to me by saying “rude” or “that’s not nice” or “quit being mean to me”. Even when I’m not being mean. So I started getting upset and he apologizes and truly feels bad. But what really crossed the line for me, is when we were with my dad and he tells my dad to tell me to “stop being mean to him and calling him names”. Which I didn’t. I called him out on it yesterday and he said that he was sorry and it was his attempt at flirting. He hasn’t had any healthy relationships before me, so I don’t know whether to believe that it’s truly his attempt at flirting or what. Am I overreacting?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

(She isn't a model per se, but several of the runners in the competition were asked if they wanted to do a photoshoot, and my daughter said yes.)

Fast forward to this week, the photos are finally released on social media, including the school's Instagram page. Many of the comments were fine, including several who told her she ""looks great,"" etc. But a few of them were borderline inappropriate, including one from a teacher who wrote that her ""body looked rocking"" or something to the effect.

My (22f) bf (25m) said my friends are rude and is annoyed after meeting them,"My bf and I have been together over a year but most of my friends who live nearby have been away for uni so he hasn't really met many of my friends. One of my friend invited us both to hers for a few drinks and then to go out to a bar then a club. I thought it would be a good chance for my bf to meet my friends so I mentioned it to him and he was excited. He can be quite socially anxious and shy/quiet in groups and especially meeting new people. 

When we get to my friends, there's me, my bf and 2 of my friends. My friend and I start catching up and she's talking about mutual friends and I try explaining to my bf who the people are that are being mentioned so he can keep up with the conversation and feel involved. My other friend spoke to my bf for a bit, asking him questions and being friendly and it looked like he was more comfortable. The friend I was catching up with didn't seem to talk to my bf a lot and mainly spoke to me then we went out to the bar and club and after about an hour my bf wanted to leave. I could see he was annoyed or upset so we left. 

The next morning I asked him what was wrong and he said he felt like an outsider all night and that every time he attempted to make conversation with my friend, she's either give him a one word answer or change the topic of conversation to yet another person he didn't know. He said she was rude and it felt like he'd been invited just to be ignored. I'm not really sure what to do but I can see that it's annoyed or upset my bf. Does anyone have any advice?

Is it reasonable for me (34F) to ask working boyfriend (36M) to learn how to cook before we get married and have kids.," 

Throwaway account, as he knows my other account.

Been together for almost 5 years. Moved in together 6 months ago. 1 year ago my health rapidly declined, through testing and procedures, we finally know what's going on and I have a consultation with my surgeon this month. Recovery will be 2 months. So I had to stop working as I had a chronic illness out of control. He started a new job 6 months ago, which require us to move. He knew because of my condition I wouldn't be able to contribute financially for a while. I was uncomfortable with this because I've always taken care of myself, but he insisted. One is because he wanted to prove to himself and me that he could take care of a household and also because the place I was at was aggravating my illness. Talked about potentially moving in together for a whole year, so here we are.

I knew my BF didn't know how to cook and clean because his place was always really dirty, like filthy to the point I wouldn't go over his house. I told him when we moved in together he would have to learn how to clean up after himself, as I keep a clean place. Moved in together and the truth came out, he didn't know how to properly clean, (even basic cleaning), as his mother hired a maid for him and his able bodied brothers. He was VERY embarrassed but was open to learning. Showed him the ropes and now he gets up on Sat and deep cleans with me. As I keep it clean throughout the week since I'm home.

Here's where my question come in. I hear a lot about if one partner is working and the other is home. The one at home should cook and clean. I cook 99% of the meals (he's attempted to cook 2 times, my bday, and valentines day over the course of 6 months), and I clean 96% of the time since we moved in. He doesn't know the first thing about cooking. He comes home, food is cooked, house is spotless. My concern is once we get married or have kids, he won't know a basic life skill. Cooking. I want to teach him, as after recovery I will go back to work that can require me to be gone for weeks, and sometimes months. Even if the project is local, I can get home at 3am.

Is it wrong on the weekends to require him to start cooking meals with me to learn, since he's the one working throughout the week? He will do it if I ask with no problem. But am I being unreasonable for asking? I grew up with a dad who worked and a stay at home mom. But my parents split chores and cooking. So I look at it as a normal request.

TL;DR!

Got ill, had to come off work. Bf and I moved in together for the first time together 6 months ago in a different city and he understood I couldn't not financially contribute until after surgery. He works on weekdays, get's home at 4:30. I cook 99% of the meals and clean 96% of the time. Taught him how to clean (he didn't know how), he helps deep clean on the weekends now. I want him to learn how to cook with me on weekends. So when we get married and have kids he will know how. But don't know if it's reasonable as I'm currently not working for health related reasons.",,,,,,,,
My ex broke up with me because he can't handle a serious relationship. Should I (21F) see my ex (20M) occassionally or fully move on?,"My ex (20M) broke up with me (21F) a month ago. We dated for 8 months. He broke up with me because he wants to be single and not have to consider another person. He admitted how scared he is to fully let go and love another person-- the lack of control over himself and his emotions, the inevitability of being hurt because he thinks that at this age we're doomed to break up at one point so why not control when he gets hurt and just break up now. I think that he feels a lack of control because before me girls would be obsessed with him, and not that I'm not obsessed, but he shows his love more than I do and I think he has the impression that he loves me more than I love him. A week before the break up he got really scared and upset because he thought I was gonna break up with him (but we wound up having a really good, emotional conversation where he told me how deeply he cares about me. and he later started feeling really uncomfortable from his public display of vulnerability). From all of our conversations, I really think he can see me/wants a future with me but he doesn't want to stop experiencing life while he's young because he's in a relationship. Despite this, I think he truly does love me but with his lack of emotional intelligence and his ingrained selfishness he would rather have the freedoms offered to him by being single (which I'm sure also includes hooking up with girls) than be tied down. (tbh I think that a lot of boys can cheat on their girlfriends and hook up with girls while they still love someone. the selfish one's at least). He's not a bad person, but he has a lot of growing up to do and because of this I do NOT wanna get back together right now. I think he has to change in a way that only happens with time. I'm honestly happy being single and being able to do what I want without the responsibilities of a relationship, I think this is an important period of my life where I might be missing out on fun experiences and doing what I want that I'm not gonna get the chance to do when I'm older.

The issue is that despite his flaws, he was really my best friend. I love him and I know he loves me, but I don't think this is the worst situation because I've also had a lot of fears about missing out on my youth because the choices I make affect another person. I want to travel, kiss who I want to, and have wild, spontaneous moments that turn into stories-- not have to sacrifice my youth because of a serious almost codependent relationship.

I know that he would be okay with this but I need advice outside from people telling me I deserve better and what he did was fucked up (which I do deserve better, but he never cheated or lied and he's allowed to not want to be in a relationship, even if it hurts me.) I don't want him to never be in my life again, I definitely need more time to solidify the breakup, but I would like to see him occasionally, maybe once or twice a month or less than that or more, in a way that is far from friends, but I still get to have him in my life when I decide. I would only do this once I'm really comfortable being single and I am talking to/hookingup/hanging out around other guys. I know this will change and I will probably meet someone else and be happy, but I don't see myself in a relationship with someone else. I have a few other ex's that I deeply loved and did for a long time, but I have never felt this way about someone else, certain that this is the kind of man I want to marry and be with in the future. So, Should I see my ex occasionally or move on and go no contact?

TL;DR My boyfriend broke up with me a month ago because he can't handle being in a serious relationship; he wants freedom without the responsibility of a relationship and he is afraid of being emotional and being hurt. Being single is probably what I need at this point in my life, but we love each other and I would like to keep him in my life. Should I see him occasionally when I decide or take a clean break?",,,,,,,,
"Does having mental health issues make someone ""immature"""," I (35f) was talking with my brother (33M) the other day. We were talking about when we were kids. Out of nowhere, he said, ""You were a lot more mature when you were younger, compared to now. Back then, you did exactly what you were told with no questions, you obeyed me, and did everything to please me. Now, you have all these ""mental heath issues, (I only used quotes because he doesn't believe in mental health issues. He says that they're excuses) You're always worried, and paranoid, and you do what you want to do, even if you know that mom and I have a problem with it.""

Those were his exact words to me. Even at our age, he still tries to control me. He (and our mother) got upset when I dyed my hair. He said that doing so made me immature because I didn't follow their orders. They treat me like a child, and he's younger. He knows that I have a lot of mental issues, and that I am constantly paranoid / worried, and he said that because of that, I am immature, and act like a child. I was speechless after he said those things to me. I told me mom what he had said. Her response: He always says things like that to me. I kind of agree with him. You were a better daughter when you just did what you were told, and stopped trying to defy us."" Did I mention that I am *35* years old? So infuriating! 😠

TL;DR: My Mom and brother called me immature for having mental health issues, and not obeying their every word at 35 years old.",,,,,,,,
Me (M22) said to a girl (F22) that I like her but unsure what to do now," 

I have met this girl online through language exchange and as time passed I started to fall a little bit in love with her. Our conversations were usually pretty casual and flirty but romance was never the main topic in the first place since we both were focused on learning a language and I didn't want to do something inconsiderate.

One day we talked about her favourite romance shows and talked about relationships etc. and she mentioned that she might end up in a second LDR but isn't sure about their standpoints since they have never met and she doesn't want to be with someone she has never met before nor who can't meet her.

I jokingly said that ""I guess I'm unfortunate because I have no chance now"". She was confused and asked if I was flirting. I indirectly answered yes but at the end I said that I like her and would like to get to know her more personally but since she is already ""dating?"" the unkown mentioned person above I told her that I'm fine and respect that, if she doesn't want to date me now. At first she thought that I was sarcastic but then she realized that I was more serious but didn't really reject / turn down on me?

We were more discussing about why or what I like about her, about her past relationships. She has probably very low self-esteem since she said to me that why someone would like her because she has no special traits and that we haven't talked about very deep topics yet and so on.  
( Note about LDRs: I don't have any problems with this kind of relationship since I work 100% remote and can very much afford to travel multiple times per year or even move to another country ).

I'm also not sure, if she is just shy, not interest, doesn't know how to answer, busy ( time zone) or it's just the language barrier sometimes since she gives me short replies occasionally ( She actually speaks my language at a good level). She has read yesterdays message but hasn't replied yet.. I might want to give her some space maybe since I don't want to look like clingy or needy

I'm not sure how to move on or what to do know and would like to get advice how I should deal with this situation.

TLDR: I confessed that I like her but she didn't turn me down. She looked in my eyes a little bit confused, unsure and has low self-esteem. Unsure what to do know or how to deal with this situation.",,,,,,,,
Me [26M] with my girlfriend [22F] shared some of my traumas from the past,"Hey, I don't really know why I have the need to do this but my brain is playing with me so here it is. I am in a quite short relationship at the moment, both me and my new girlfriend are quite into each other and we have been together for 2 weeks now. We talked about our pasts and our experiences that we do not want to happen in our relationship. Everything is just going really good and I like her quite a lot. I did learn quite a lot about her that I like and she learned quite a lot about me that she likes. I have had really bad relationships in the past and those have played a big role for me to not hop into a new relationship pretty fast so I was single for almost 3 years now. Yesterday I had a really bad day for some reason and today when we saw each other I decided to go a bit deep into my traumas. One of those is trust issues, and I wanted to let her know that I do have problem with that but for the duration of our relationship I never had any of those thoughts, I do have a lot of trust in her and I don't really know why I had the need to do that but I did it. Her reaction was at first worrying but I reassured her that with her I don't really feel the same way and it is all good. I really don't know why I said it but there we go it is too late now to go back and change it. I did it because I trust her and I feel safe with her. At the same time I am working on fixing everything with my mental health and I go to therapy as well. Second thing, I hate it when I need to wait for a response for 4-5 hours on the texts, I understand it when I know that for example she studies and I know that she studies, or has uni or work or anything, that is really not the problem. I started laughing when I was telling that because I sounded controlling and she started laughing with me and told me I know what you mean don't worry. I felt dumb and annoyed with myself for telling that the way I told her but here we go. She reassured me she understands it and I have nothing to worry about. I hate it when I don't get the answer when I know she doesn't have anything and basically sits home and plays with her dog for example. Then I asked her would you be okay if I answered you 4 hours later and you know I had nothing beside me sitting by the PC playing games and she said of course I wouldn't be okay. 
I felt good when I told her all of this but at the same time overthinking kicks me in the butt now.

---
**tl;dr**: So basically I told my GF that I have trust issues, but none with her and that with her I feel safe around and I trust her so that's why I told her that. I hate late answers (4-5 hours late answers not 3 hours or less) when I know that both of us are free. She reassured me that everything is fine and that she is happy that I shared all of that with her and made some jokes later during texts about all that. Am I overthinking for no reason?",,,,,,,,
showing strong interest for a bit then act indifferent,"So there’s this girl at work (21F) which I (25M) clicked with right away when we first met. We’re talking here and there but nothing special going on. Few months go by, I suddenly develop strong feelings for this girl. It was quite sudden and intense. At one point it got so intense I decided to tell her about it - she turned me down. 

No big deal, then we keep talking like normal, but now we gradually start talking even more and get closer in the process. We’re both rather fun in nature, we just have fun in the boring workplace. However, I am no longer going in with any romantic intent/expectation. She’s just a cool person at work that I like to talk to and with whom we have many things to talk about and whom I have interest to get to know better (as a person). 

Then few months later, suddenly out of nowhere she began showing a strong interest in me for about 2 weeks, perhaps 3. I was riding the wave and enjoying the ride, but I also started developing those strong and intense feelings from before, again. I fell quick and I fell hard. But after those 2-3 weeks, she started to, not slowly but rather quickly, by the day, show less and less interest and attraction, and now we don’t really talk anymore at all. But those 2 weeks felt so so real, it felt like teenagers being in love in high school. It felt so real 

Whole thing threw me quite off guard really, but the thing that annoys me the most is I have no idea why that last bit happened. And how should I best proceed from the current situation? I am aware that this person has some really really special role in my life, I just can’t quite figure it out, and this I am confused about my next move(s) and general direction even. I would much appreciate some guidance/advice.


TL;DR - Fell for a girl at work. Told her about it, she turned me down. No big deal. We kept talking, I no longer had romantic expectations or intentions. We start talking more and we get closer, then she suddenly began showing strong interest for 2-3 weeks then suddenly began acting completely indifferent - now we don’t really talk anymore. Idk how to interpret the whole thing, *especially* that last bit.",,,,,,,,
Boyfriend of 6 years does not want to own a house together.,"My Bf(31) and I (28)  have been together for 6 years now first net when we were both broke students doing our Masters degree. Since then, we managed to graduate with myself managing to land a good-paying job and a rental 1 bedroom apartment before he also got referred into the same company and moved in. We have been living together for almost 3 years now. 

I started discussing with him plans for marriage and buying a house as now we are both financially well enough to do so. His response has been to shut off and distance himself from the conversation. . Like puts his headohones on and walk out of the room. I have brought this conversation up multiple times and it has been the same response almost every time. 

  Only thing I managed to get from him as a reason is that he does not want to be in debt for the rest of his life to a bank. To him, there is nothing wrong in renting a house till end of time. For me, if we can afford paying the rental money every month, we can afford paying a mortgage. Especially with a very good joint income that we have together. 
I feel like am running out of time. I want to get married for a year or two, buy a house, live for a couple of years till we can further afford getting kids, and then go for that, but by this state, it seems that by then, it would be already too late. He is very much aware of my stance on this. 

I just need some advice on what to do and what could he be thinking? I really dont know if there is a compromise in such a situation that would make us happy
 
Thank you

I {18M} caught my girlfriend {19 W} with her ex on her phone.,"So me and my girlfriend were on the train to class and I looked over and there was a snap text from a unrecognized name. (for context he is the only guy she has had a hard time with because she has bpd and he left her). He was under another name (she said he was always under this) He texted her that he will be in town tomorrow and that he has to talk to his friend about ""it"". She told me at first that she never texted him and he did this out of the blue. among further talking she said he texted her at the saint paddys parade and that he wanted to see her but she told their mutual friend she didn't. she was very apologetic and I am incline to believe her. I want to wait and see if it happens again, but I'm not sure what to do? (She also has 100's of pictures with him on her phone.

"I (19m) flirting with two people 19f, 20(f) while single, didn't agree to be mutually exclusive with either, but feelings still got hurt.","

So I 19(m) was talking to two friends, we started flirting casually back and forth. I'm naturally flirty, so I wasn't aware that I gave off the impression that I was romantically interested in them. Well, I discussed beforehand with person A, that I didn't want to do long distance, unless we could see each other.
We were also regularly communicating about the people we were matching with on bumble, tinder, and who we were attracted to etc.

They brought up the idea to visit, and I Essentially said ""sure why not"". Well, a person I've been friends with for a long time finally confessed that they were attracted to me, we exchanged a few NSFW images, and I confessed my attraction towards them.
I felt like I should tell friend A, so I did.  They seemed upset, and I'm assuming for a valid reason. I shouldn't have lead them on, I guess. 

It's difficult, because I really valued person a as a friend. Just didn't see  us becoming romantically involved.

Fuck, this is stressful. I feel super guilty, but I'm not sure if it's misplaced or not. What should I do going foward?
tl;dr flirted with two friends, ended up getting involved with one, other person got upset.",,,,,,,,

So i posted on here yesterday about how I accidentally overstepped the boundaries of my gf, here’s a quick recap. We have been dating for almost 2 months and the other day when we hung out I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes and we started kissing. I ended up getting on top of her and we started kissing then, she seemed to have enojoyed it at the moment. The next day she told me she fet uncomfortable during it, I had no way of knowing, if she had told me I would have stopped. She kind of became distant after that, I called her today and we talked about how she would rather keep dating for a little longer instead of rushing into a relationship. Obviously it was the moment of uncomfortableness that made her rethink, and of course it is my fault. I communicated with her and told her its okay I would be fine with dating for a little longer and would let her take the lead when it comes to stuff like that. I just don’t know how to feel at this point. What should i do/feel?

I (F32) need help deciphering a text from a past guy I dated (M29),"Hi!

I dated ""Bob"" last year at the beginning of the year. We dated for three months until he told me he wasn't interested in me anymore. He gave the most random excuses. He said he doesn't like where we eat, he likes to take risks, and something else I can't remember.

Today I get a text message out of the blue asking me what I have been up to. I just told him a basic answer and then asked what is up? I wanted to know what he wanted. He tells me something reminded him of me and wanted to check-in.

Why would he care? The last I heard from him was last year. We do not live in the same city because I would think he was looking for a hookup if we did.

Update: My Boyfriend Ruined My Milestone Celebration By Inviting His Friends Without Even Telling Me,"Here's the link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11r5qkk/my_boyfriend_ruined_my_milestone_celebration_by/


TL, DR: my(f38)  now ex ( m40)destroyed  my dream career milestone celebration by having his friends tag along without consulting me. They ate all the food, crashed in our tent and  basically had their own party without hardly acknowledging my presence. I left alone and later on, he accused me of being self centered.


I talked to him and he denied all wrong doing. He only focused on his needs during the conversation. How I made him look stupid in front of everyone and how I left him  stranded and so on. He never apologized, didn't even mention it was my own special celebration. I mentioned my needs aren't being met in this relationship and he said I'm being too finicky. That I'm asking to ""see blood"" only because he made the mistake of thinking he had equal footing in  the relationship and bringing people that are important to him to the campout site. The more I tried to reason with him, that it's not about his friends, but rather sneaking them upon me and the occasion, the more he resisted so I gave up. I said I no longer want the relationship because I feel humiliated and that I don't have an actual representation of my needs. 


He blew up on me. He said I was testing his patience. That I'm just ""like the others"". That I was never in it to help him or actually invest in what he wanted to build but that I'm full of ego and unwilling to listen. I told him to grab his things and leave but he refused.


He called me about three times after our argument. He was angry and said some awful things, like I need to straighten up my behavior because no man will ever stick around like he did. That basically, he's doing me a favor by being in a long term relationship and that he was gonna propose but I just made him change his mind. I blocked him everywhere, grabbed all his personal stuff and canceled the Airbnb we were staying at. I left all his shit at his best friend's. I'm refusing to take calls from unknown numbers because it might be him. My head is a mess right now. I'm staying at a hotel and thinking about getting a new temp place out of the area. I don't trust him, especially after what I saw in his face during our argument. 


I feel as hurt as when I broke up with a very snobby ex who poverty shamed me but now this is a twisted reverse situation. Right now, the only person who knows this is my ex boyfriend who's been very supportive and treats me like family. At least I know he doesn't want anything from me. I don't wanna burden him with my stuff because I don't want to abuse his good will. 


Regarding my new break up, I just wanna get away from him. Another thing, while arguing, his sister's engagement came up. I'm getting the vague impression that he promised his family a wedding at a high end Airbnb that I guess would ""happen"" during one of my stays. I could be wrong but his insistence about not breaking up and continuously saying "" sister just got engaged"" was weird. 


Thanks everyone for your support. And to everyone who sent me DMs. I'm gonna take myself on my own celebration for a do over like someone suggested. ",,,,,,,,
My (40M) Wife (39F) wife tells me she’s grossed out by my lack of expertise in one area of sex and she says that she will never let that change. I don’t know how to feel about it.,"Ok, not sure where to begin on this one since it involves a lot of relationship backstory but I’ll do my best. I (40M) have been married to my wife (39F) for 10 years and together for 4 years before that. We have, in almost all ways, a good marriage—an beautiful home, happy and healthy kids, fulfilling careers, independent hobbies as well as shared interests, good conversations, a good set of friends whom we entertain at our house, and in general love and trust. As the youngest kid is getting better, our sex life is also improving to look a bit more like it was pre-kids (though of course we are more tired, busier, and less carefree, and that just comes with the territory of being a parent).

I’ve always had some insecurity around sex. I was an overweight and shy teenager; didn’t lose my virginity until I was 20; and only had a couple of medium-to-longer term relationships before W and I got together (at a point when I was just beginning to feel confident around women). She came into the marriage much more experienced; I recognize that caring about body counts is pretty silly and sexist and I’ve worked to get over insecurity about that in particular. One way we’ve done is by talking through some prior experiences and trying to make that exciting. 

But there’s a lingering issue that is causing me to experience what feels like an intimacy gap and it just seems unsolvable. Early in our relationship i went down on her a few times but she wasn’t enthusiastic about it and didn’t want it to be part of our routine. At the time she explained it as just being something she didn’t enjoy. When I later learned that she’d had relationships with women, I was a little more skeptical but she then stuck to her original answer. More recently, she admitted that that wasn’t true, and that receiving oral sex had been a significant part of her past relationships but that she just didn’t want to do it now. I felt hurt by this, particularly the lack of honesty. 

She later tried to explain it as just something that she didn’t want sexually from men, but even more recently owned up to the real explanation which is just that she didn’t think I was good at it early on, doesn’t like the idea of teaching me, and now has feelings of revulsion associated with me and that act in particular that she isn’t interested in getting over. Most recently, she told me that it would never happen with me but that if I pressed it she would let me do it and lie and say it felt good. The possibility that it’s something she could help teach me how to do in a pleasurable way is categorically off the table. 

This has triggered some pretty deep seated feelings of insecurity in me (I recognize that those are my responsibility and not her fault). And TBTH I don’t care that much about this particular sex act. Nonetheless, I’m having a ton of trouble getting past the fact that my wife finds my lack of experience in our area actually repulsive and she wouldn’t entertain the possibility of trying to making me better and thus more able to feel like I can make her happy. The only “solution” she’s offered so far is that I could go sleep with other woman and get more experienced before she’d be willing to try (she has pretty flexible feelings about monogamy though we haven’t opened up our marriage) but I’m not particularly enthusiastic about that option for various reasons.

The upshot is that I feel a gulf of intimacy between us. It’s such a small thing, yet it’s really hard to get past the idea that my wife just finds me sexually gross due to my lack of experience in this way and is totally unwilling to and interested in making it better (and that I’ll be lied to if I press it again). It just makes me feel less close to her and that I have no prospect of ever having the kind of closeness I want. Again, this is not really about this specific thing—it’s about what it conveys about how she feels about me. 

So, with the caveat that *I know* my insecurities about my own background are my own problem, is it still fair for me to be hurt by her? And what if anything should I do about it either way? 

tl;dr: Wife admits after years of marriage that she doesn’t let me perform oral sex because she’s too grossed out by my early efforts and she would never consider working with me to make it better. I feel hurt and insecure and don’t know how to handle those feelings.",,,,,,,,
Draining friend,"&amp;#x200B;

This will be a rather long post, but I hope some people will take their time to read it.. Cause boy do I need advice

I'm f21, and used to have a big friend group, going out for coffee or a beer for that sake during weekdays - and would be out every weekend. Because of some dumb reason they all turned their back against me (this was a bit over a year ago) Today I know they regret how they handled the situation, but I never got back in contact with them.

Long story short, I met this girl half a year ago (f25) and she introduced me to a lot of people and I was back to the person I used to be, going out every weekend and meeting new people. But our friendship quickly started to drain me, and a lot of people told me to cut her off, and still do. Let's call her Sarah. Sarah and I quickly became each others best friend, but with that a big responsibility came. I had to constantly reassure her, that she was pretty enough, good enough, had a great personality and bla bla bla, you get the point. This would occur everytime we went out, and the whole ''vibe'' would be based on how insecure she felt that day. (Which most of the time were awful) she was the ''leader'' of the group, and things had to go her way.. so you can imagine how it is with a bad vibe. She would often lie, to get things her way, or be jealous/insecure when we went out since she always compared herself to me or sometimes others. This would make me feel bad, and I reassured her that people don't want me - but her. Her responds would always be ''You have to say that since you're my friend''.. But would still ask me to reassure her.

For a while I stopped, because I knew I would just get snarky responds but that would offend her

One night I just got enough of her bullshit, I had told her I wanted to go to an event for the longest time (Note I actually already had planned to go with a friend, she wanted to be invited so I did:)))))) and she reassured me that ''yeah ofc we would go'' But ofc she had to show off her new job, and when I asked when we would leave, she said ''yeah maybe later'' This girl wanted to go somewhere else because a boy she liked was there, I got told by one of our mutual friends who was with us that night, that Sarah asked her to tell me she didn't have money enough so that would be an excuse to not go LITERALLY TO THE GIRL I HAD PLANS WITH FIRST. Which hurt me and pissed me off at the same time, so I left and she got annoyed and started texting me. My response was that I got told these things, and she said it was a lie - I offered her multiple times to meet me outside so we could talk but that just got brushed over, at one point I texted ''I can't be friends with people who lies all the time'' This was not only her, but the whole group I was talking about and she knew that - she decided to block me on all social medias and refused to give me my stuff back. This was after we've been friends for about 4 months. I was very depressed at that time, not only had I lost her but the whole friend group.. I was back to square one and questioned myself, am I the reason why I'm losing friends all the time? I tried to keep my chin up, but my heart was hurtig lol.. 2-3 months later she hit me up on facebook, she apparently left the group since it was so toxic and met a guy while traveling, her reason for contacting me was she missed me, and our friendship.

We became friends again, but this time it was just the two of us - and long distance. I'll try to make this short but everything again has to go her way, we wanted to move and start traveling together, ofc to the country where the guy she met lives because she felt at home. Me being me I followed her and we traveled to London - we decided that we would go again, though I needed some time since I had an exam and couldn't book anything before. She only had to wait ONE FREAKING DAY, but she decided that right here, right now she would book everything and I told her multiple times that I couldn't just throw everything out of my hands and just leave, and that I'll book tomorrow. She got mad for me not understanding, and said my reaction isn't fair because she has a lot going on and she would just go with a friend. She said ''Everything is not about you, I have other people in my life!'' This was about a week ago and these words still kinda hurt (Note, it was our dream to get a job together in London) We haven't texted that much since she's in London right now, but when we do it's about her all the time, I told her today I got offered a job interview, her response was ''yay!'' And quickly changed the topic back to her and how she's going out bowling with other people tonight.. I'm thinking like.. okay :/ what do you want me to say? It's like this all the time and at this point I don't know if I'm jealous, or just annoyed there's so much more but I'll make a list cause this is.. too long

* Everything has to go her way
* Very bipolar, and has psychotic issues. tho this shouldn't stop someone from being friends the bipolar is just.. a lot
* Knows how to make you feel bad and will do it on purpose
* Once said her friend thought I was hot, and that she liked him but in a friendly way.. Few days later she took him home and had sex. I wonder why? :)))
* Gets jealous if someone likes me
* Recently got mad because I talked to this guy at the club, who she liked (she literally has a man, tho not official) And we went downstairs to get beer, note how she never told me she liked him since we literally met him THAT night, and he doesn't even like girls
* Her problems takes up a lot of time, and I feel like I'm only here for her to vent
* Proceeds to go back to the guy she vents about, and I just feel like my time is wasted ngl (We sometimes chat for 3 hours about this whole problem)
* Gets mad when I don't respond when online and spam
* Gets mad if I skip over her question, or don't hype her up
* Will ACTUALLY stalk u, and see if you're online if you don't respond

Now you may ask ''Why don't you just cut her off?'' And the thing is I love her, and I now she loves me. For the first time I feel like I found a best friend, where I'm also theirs. Most of the time she makes me feel included and would do mostly anything for me. But I do feel drained at this point, but I'm also scared to just cut her off and be alone, what if I'm just the problem? Would love to hear u guys opinion

Idk what to do, or how to feel - I feel like everything is my fault

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* My friend is draining me, I hate myself for it and I don't know what to do",,,,,,,,
Is it okay to ask a guy out as a girl?,"
Had what I thought was a good phone call with someone I met off a dating app. We had been speaking for some time and I suggested it. He then suggested we can meet instead but unfortunately our timetables didn’t work out today so he said we can call today and plan for a meet up later. Is there anything I should say after the call? I don’t want to be the only one initiating things

TL;DR: 28F want to meet up with someone I met off a dating app who I’ve been talking for a few weeks but don’t want to be the only one initiating things",,,,,,,,
"Should I [26 M] stay with my GF [26F] of 5 years,"," 

I have been with my girlfriend for over 5 years now, and she has been asking for me to pop the question a lot, especially lately. We don't have a lot of problems, we have been to couples counseling before for arguing, but almost everyone we know refers to us as a dream couple. We have the same hobbies, we do pretty much everything together, we live together, we have the same sense of humor, etc.

So whats the problem?

Part of it is, and there is no way to say this without seeming like a bad person and being vain, but I am just finding myself less and less attracted to her. She is not bad looking by any means, but physical attraction was never what made us get together and she was never my type, I was just amazed by how chill and fun she was and how well we normally get along. The other part is things shes does have been annoying me more often than they used to and becoming harder to overlook. She is a very headstrong and type A personality, so I pretty much always have to let her lead otherwise conflict arises. This has lead to a dent in my confidence as I feel less ""manly"" and ""in control"" sometimes even though I know that is ridiculous and somewhat misogynistic. It just kind of feels like what she says goes and if I argue I will always lose, so I just don't speak up sometimes which leads to internalized problems like these.

We still have sex slightly less than weekly, and its normally pretty good, but she doesn't get me going as much as other girls have in the past and the excitement I feel seeing other girls never went away. I was with dozens of girls before, and it was when I was at my most confident. Obviously that lifestyle shouldn't be permanent but I feel if I had to date again now would be the time as I'm more than halfway through my twenties and if I wait too long it seems to only get worse.

Logically, it makes almost complete sense to marry her. We have built a pretty good life together, we live together, we have a cat we both adore, we have both become fully immersed into each others families, I already know what ring she wants, we do everything together, etc.

But would I be making the worst or best decision of my life if I didn't marry her, which would I guess mean leaving her? I can not imagine leaving her and this life we have, but I can't imagine marrying someone unless I have complete confidence in the decision and I just don't right now. She has been waiting for years so the pressure is only getting worse and I don't know how much longer she can wait.

I have been feeling this awful indecisiveness for over a year and it is eating me alive. I truly do not know what the right decision is. I have even considered things like polyamory but I doubt she would ever go for that. Do I suck it up and marry someone that mostly makes sense and would put so much less strain on my life, or do I risk it all for the excitement of dating again and the possibility I'd be happier?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My GF wants me to propose ASAP and I am more scared than excited on if I am making the right decision",,,,,,,,
Does he even like me?,"So I 35(f) am engaged to my 35(m) boyfriend of 12 years. We have not been doing well romantically and intimately and are in therapy together to try to sort things out. I feel like he’s holding on to our relationship with a death grip, because we are pretty codependent and now have a young child, but it has been feeling increasingly like he doesn’t actually like me as a person. I have always felt like I am just a terrible and annoying person, because of an abusive upbringing, so any time I felt this from him I felt like I understood why he wouldn’t like me or would think I’m annoying or too much to deal with. Now that I’m healing my trauma it seems more and more like I chose a partner who is in a lot of ways similar to my caregivers as a child who really messed me up. He is not abusive but I feel emotionally neglected all the time, manipulated and that his love for me is at times conditional. I have tried everything I can possibly think of to get him to stop taking me for granted, to show him there are issues that need his immediate attention and that my love for him is slowly dying. 

It took him over a year of constant fighting and me pleading, to agree to couples therapy and he says he thinks it’s helpful and valuable, but I feel like there’s been hardly any significant changes and several of the changes I have seen have not been consistent. In a lot of our sessions I feel like he just wastes the whole hour creating untrue narratives about his part in the issues and then we end up going back and forth about this made up narrative and are not really getting anywhere. 

I feel so exhausted. Every time I try to tell him I’m at the end of my patience with xyz happening, he then seems to somehow make it all about me and how I’m not sure I want to be in the relationship anymore and that’s why there’s a problem. Every time I tell him when he hurts me emotionally he makes me explain it in excruciating detail and it feels like I have to argue why what happened hurt me. I feel neglected and alone so often it contributes heavily to my depression and self esteem issues, that I have been working really hard on improving. Any time I call him out for , what feels to me like gas lighting/ manipulation or lying , he just tells me it was not his intention and so it’s not actually gas lighting or lying/ manipulation. 

I told him recently that looking back it hurts me that he has seemingly never supported any of my ambitions and in some cases did the opposite of encouraging me. I just keep looking back at past and more present instances where the way he has treated me, if he were anyone else, I would assume they do not like me fundamentally. 

I think the most depressing part lately is that he waited for 12 years to propose to me and we have been engaged for almost a year. Neither of us want a big or expensive wedding, but he won’t set a date. I have told him numerous times for almost our whole engagement I wanted to get married at the end of this year on a specific significant date and he doesn’t seem to care and has given no indication he has thought about it in any significant way.

I promised I would stick with therapy and not just walk away without warning, but I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I feel myself slipping back into a deep depression where I just cry all the time and can’t seem to enjoy anything except sleeping. I have talked to him directly in therapy and outside of it about pretty much all of this and nothing seems to change.


TL/DR my fiancé doesn’t seem to like me as a person but likes our relationship and life together. I am feeling depressed about the thought he doesn’t like me as a person. Therapy and direct talks do not seem to make any difference. Am I misreading the situation maybe because of my mental health? Am I wasting my time waiting for things to get better? Or am I rally just an insufferable person who should be thankful to have a relationship at all? Am I looking at this all the wrong way?",,,,,,,,
Am I (26f) being dramatic for being upset at my bf (28m) for what he said ?,"Please excuse any mistakes I'm dyslexic.  I'm gonna try to keep this short
 I have been officially dating my bf for a year and 7 months.  We were shopping and just joking when we walked past flowers for sale.  He jokingly said ""do u want flowers, if u do u have to buy them yourself.""  I knew it was a joke he's bought flowers for me before I said ""does that mean I have to buy myself flowers on our anniversary.""  He said ""yes bc idk when it is.""  I kinda guessed he didn't know so I wasn't really mad.  I asked ""him do u want a clue and u will get it straight away.""  He said ""no I don't want to know when it is.""  I went quiet and he knew I was upset.  When we got back to the car he asked me what's wrong I said nothing.  When we got home I was tired and upset and I can't eat when I'm upset.  My bf begged me to at least have dinner and when I refused he was pissed at me.  I went to bed anyway.  This made me feel like he didn't care about the relationship, he's never made me feel like that before.  Am I being dramatic for being upset?  And what do I say to him?

TL;DR: my bf said he didn’t want to know when our anniversary was. Am I being dramatic for being upset? What should I say to him?",,,,,,,,
am i (19f) paranoid about 20m guy Im dating?,"I've been seeing this dude for summe time now and hes pretty cool. I am, however, worried about some of the boundaries he had with his woman friends. I dont know if Im being paranoid or if im valid in this concern, but some of the things he does towards some of them in particular rub me the wrong way. The first couple times we were hanging out he told me a bunch of his woman friends are after him but he isnt really interested in them like that. Comepletely unsolicsited comment by the way. We were in the middle of talking about chickpeas. He sprung that on me out of no where. He has admitted to me having crushes on some of his woman friends in the past as well. But he remains platonic with them today. Theres this one woman who I think its kinda obvious he likes, though I havent interacted with them both in the same room enough to tell. I do know his reactions to her when talking about her or when shes not around makes me slightly uncomfortable even if they, in isolation, are nothing glaring. One time he saw her car parked and got really excited and rushed to park right next to hers. There was one time he was talking about her tattoos and how he admired them and how he wanted to get tattoos similiar to that. One time we were hanging out and he said he remembered her saying she wanted some soup earlier that day, so he called her while we were on our date and asked if she wanted the soup she wanted earlier cuz he wanted to pick some up for her. Then there was the time he was showing off this cool tshirt to me he really liked. Come to find out the tshirt was her handmedown he brought off her. 
I brought it up to him and he hasnt spoken to me in a week. I dont know if I was overreacting and that turned him off or summn. How should I approach him again? 


Tl;dr guy Im seeing has weird boundaries w some of his girl friends. Idk if Im overreacting though.",,,,,,,,
