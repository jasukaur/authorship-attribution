       "'[\\'The Chinese economy could shrink for the first time in decades because of the coronavirus, according to a report by the International Monetary Fund. The virus has killed more than 1,000 people in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain and is believed to be causing respiratory illnesses there. The IMF warns that the economies of those countries could be stunted, as well as other countries in the region. Chinese exports to the three countries could shrink by around 10% due to the virus, the IMF said., the country\\'s top economic planner said Wednesday.  The economy could contract by up to 3 percent this year and by another 1 or 2 percent in 2016 if the coronavirus continues to spread, said Deputy Premier Zhu Guangyao.  \"The Chinese economy is not just based on the growth of exports and investment, but also domestic consumption,\" Zhu said in a speech in Beijing. \"If the consumption side suffers a setback, the growth of exports and investment will also decline.\"  Zhu said the Chinese government was taking \"all possible measures\" to contain the virus, which has caused a global health emergency.  The deputy premier\\'s comments are the first time a senior government official has publicly warned of the possible economic consequences of the coronavirus.  The World Health Organization has said the virus could cause up to $5 billion in economic losses this year, and more if the virus spreads to other countries.  Zhu\\'s comments suggest that Beijing is already taking the economic risks of a pandemic into account as it plans its response.  China has been a top donor of medical aid to the WHO and has dispatched teams of health experts to help contain the virus.  The Chinese government has also said it will provide financial aid to people affected by the virus.  Zhu\\'s comments come as the WHO issues an update on the global response to the pandemic.  The WHO says the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus has reached 10,000, with more than 4,000 people dead.  The WHO is urging countries to ramp up their response to the pandemic and has called for more funding to help fight it.\\']'"
