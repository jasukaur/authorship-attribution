       "'the 30 most troubling lines from donald trumps latest news conference on coronavirus the 30 most troubling lines from donald trumps latest news conference on coronavirus cnn in a photo op with irish prime minister leo varadkar on thursday president donald trump took a series of questions about the coronavirus pandemic and his administrations handling of itit was really something i went through the transcript of his remarks and picked out the lines you need to see theyre belowin each episode of his weekly youtube show chris cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics click to subscribe1 i see theyve canceled their big soccer games their championship games and a lot of other games theyve canceled a lot over in europe and all over the world so this is a big world problembig world problem  president trump on a global pandemic and away we go2 we took the original boldest step of all when we closed very early with china that helped us save thousands of lives and we went very early with europetrumps focus  as it has been since nearly the start of this virus  is on proving that he did the right thing by limiting arrivals from china and as of wednesday night from europe as well as for his claim that his moves have helped us save thousands of lives that is a very hard thing to factcheck3 but itll be  itll go very quicklytheres no indication that coronavirus will go very quickly none4 well be discussing some other moves that were going to be making and i think its going to work out very well for everybodywell im convinced5 and theyre  theyre doing a very good job they dont have very much infection at this point and hopefully theyll keep it that waythe united kingdom to which trump is referring here has 373 cases according to the world health organization thats many more than other european countries where trump has banned travel6 well we get along very well with the european leaders but we had to make a decision and i didnt want to take time  and you know it takes a long time to make the individual callsworld leaders have long mocked each other with trump they mean it  the washington post7 in the case of european union ive consulted with many peopleliterally what does this mean8 and the same people then they say oh he closed too fast why did he close  most of them said why did he close with china that turned out to be a great moveagain trump wants to ensure people know he deserves credit for closing travel to china thats the key takeaway here not the impact the coronavirus is having in the united states9 when you think of what happened to europe because it was very fast and very furious10 you know you see whats going on and so i just wanted that to stop as it pertains to the united states and thats what weve done weve stopped itnarrator voice we havent not even close11 we have a big one in tampa all sold out we had over 100000 requests for tickets but i think well probably not do it because people would say its better to not dothe question here was what trump planned to do about campaign rallies given the warnings about the need to avoid large crowds in spreading the coronavirus the president turned it into a chance to brag about how many tickets were requested for a rally so yeah12 and what is the number as of this morning is it 32 you could tell me is it 32 deaths steve around thatthe president of the united states is unaware of how many americans have died as a result of coronavirus indefensible at the moment 38 people have passed away in the us from coronavirus13 i mean think of it the united states because of what i did and what the administration did with china we have 32 deaths at this pointits 38 and it was 38 when trump said this14 other countries that are smaller countries have many many deaths thirtytwo is a lot thirtytwo is too many but when you look at the kind of numbers that youre seeing coming out of other countries its pretty amazing when you think of ityes he is patting himself on the back and yes he is wrong about the number of deaths and yes this quote is literally whatever the opposite of empathy is15 we have very strong emergency powers under the stafford act and we are  we havent  i mean i have it memorized practically as to the powers in that actthe stafford act allows among other things a president to declare a disaster a move that frees up federal resources to deal with something like the coronavirus it is 192 pages long  president trump has it memorized16 i have the right to do a lot of things that people dont even know aboutwell this isnt ominous at all17 look were in  were in great shape compared to other places we are in really good shape and we want to keep it that way thats why i did the ban with respect to europetheres little value to european travel restrictions poor use of time  energy earlier yes now travel restrictionsscreening are less useful we have nearly as much disease here in the us as the countries in europe we must focus on layered community mitigation measuresnow  former trump administration department of homeland security adviser tom bossert18 you have to remember the stock market as an example is still much higher than when i got hereas of noon eastern time thursday 83 of the gains the stock market had made since trump came into office had been wiped out by fears over the pandemics effect on the world economy according to the new york times peter baker19 we love the irishokeydoke20 people have  you know we call it cases how many cases do you have well relative to other countries we have very few cases relative to certain of the  of the major countries that really have a bigger problem than uswe call it cases21 lets put it this way im not concerned okin which the president dismisses questions about the fact that he was photographed over the weekend with a brazilian press aide who has been diagnosed with the coronavirus sure ok22 they have a million tests out now theyre going to have over the next few days theyre going to have 4 million tests out and frankly the testing has been going very smooththe idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it were not set up for that do i think we should be yes but were not that is a failing it is a failing lets admit it  dr anthony fauci today23 were doing it the opposite were very much ahead of everythingsimply not true24 well i think the democrats wont be having rallies but nobody showed up to their rallies anyway so what difference does it makevery modernday presidential stuff here very25 my rallies are very big theyre very big rallies and well be making a decision at the appropriate timeright you said that already26 and i dont want people dying thats what im all aboutwhen people ask me what i am all about in the future i am going to say i dont want people dying thats what im all about27 so i had to make that decision and frankly the people that are professionals praise the decision and its something i had to do and i think youll see the end result is very good because of ittrumps decisions are according to trump a praised by professionals and b will look even better sometime very soon28 i used to be in the real estate business as youve probably heard they built some really  and i  i built beautiful buildings and theyve built some really beautiful buildingsso canceling the olympics in japan would be bad because of all the beautiful buildings that had been built as always laserfocused on whats important29 some areas have no problem whatsoever in our country and others do30 you see what theyre doing in new rochelle which is  which is good frankly its the right thing but its not enforced its not very strong but people know theyre  theyre being watched new rochelle thats a hot spotyeah this feels like a good place to end'"
