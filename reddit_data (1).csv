Cmv: I don't like mandalorians. They're a savage group. And I don't like how popular they are.,"That's exactly what I said. They're a savage group who follows blindly a set of values that have got them into trouble. I mean, just because a demon looking Zabrak with force powers won a fight, everyone bows to then and lick his boots instead of shooting the bastard?

When there isn't an external enemy they just fight each other, making their planet not have one single tree up because of wars - resource mining and battles making creation of wildlife impossible.

Not to mention they're expansionist and only stopped doing that because they got bigger problems. Or else they would just dominate other planets, because they're violent.

And each time they get rightfully obliterated - because they're dangerous - they get more extreme. Can't take your helmet off, can't do this, can't do that, like a damn cult.

How the hell am I supposed to like a culture, a group of people, who are based on violence?

And is the average fan just so much into them for cool armor and cool looks, not realizing they were warmongers and violent people even before the equally warmonger and violent Empire?

Change my view."
CMV: AI-powered dating app bots that get you dates are ethical,"Got tired of wasting so much time on all my dating apps just to scrape together a date or two a month. So as a passion project, I decided to build an AI-powered dating app bot that could do all the swiping and chatting for me to get numbers. Using dating apps I found that once I actually got a girls number and could call her, I could usually build enough rapport with my charisma to schedule a date.

It was important to me to make sure the bot only swiped right on girls that were actually my type. It was also crucial that when the bot chatted with my matches it sounded like me and used as few possible back and forths as possible to get the number. Once I got the number, I would call the girl, build rapport and schedule a date. This wasn't easy to build. The bot is designed to learn my preferences based on my previous matches, allowing it to understand my type of girl and engage in meaningful conversations that are tailored to my interests. This was built using a fine tuned version of GPT-3 trained on 5k conversations that got a girls number and MobileNet V3 for classifying my ""type"". 

The results have been astounding. In the first month, the bot scheduled 13 dates for me, all of which were with girls who matched my preferences and had similar interests to mine. I no longer have to waste time swiping aimlessly or struggling to come up with conversation starters. What's important here is that when I call the girl, I explain to them that they were talking to a bot on the dating app. So far, every girl has laughed it off and been impressed that I could build such a thing. 

We're living in the Cambrian explosion of AI, excited to see it improve our lives in more areas."

CMV: Movie critics should stop reviewing MCU movies,"Ok now this isn't necessarily a fully-formed opinion, but I think there's something here so please hear me out and help me poke some holes in it.

Many critics of the latest few Marvel/MCU movies (e.g. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thor: Love and Thunder) have left reviews along the lines of ""there are too many Marvel movies, the tropes are tired and the beats are predictable"". 

Is this a valid opinion to have? Yes, of course. 

...Is this a useful criticism of the 35th installation in a superhero movie franchise? I would say no.

My opinion is that MCU movies reached a point (probably after Infinity War) of being nerdy enough that the only people in the public still watching them, are people that have watched all/most of them, enjoy the superhero trope, and appreciate the weird universe-expanding format.

At this point it's like a comic franchise... imagine if critics reviewed each new Marvel comic by saying ""there are too many superhero comics, the tropes are tired"". That's not a fair criticism of a Marvel comic, so should it be of a Marvel movie?

The critics' Rotten Tomatoes score of Quantumania is 47, and the audience's score is 83. This to me perfectly illustrates that the consumers of Marvel movies are generally much more bought into the format, than the average critic. People who are sick of superhero movies are no longer watching these movies, and will not go see the next movie depending on critics' opinions.  

So to round up my opinion, I think that most critics should stop reviewing most MCU movies. Maybe some stand on their own as fun stories and can be watched in isolation, but the more world building weirdness there is, the worse this will get, and at one point critic reviews will be completely useless."
CMV: I don’t think there is anything that is not okay to joke about.,"I recently had a debate with someone who thought that certain things are not okay to laugh at and I completely disagree.

I think EVERYTHING can be funny if the joke it told the proper way. I would even say I’ve probably heard/seen something funny about every serious, sad, horrific and distressing subject matter.

There is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about. 

* Time &amp; place: I don’t think unsolicited jokes will be received well and that’s understandable. In passing, on the street, at work, at school or even among friends. If someone comes to a show or chooses to watch/listen to media with jokes, I think that those are the few places where *everything* is okay to joke about. Telling a sexist joke to someone while they looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time. 


So given the proper time and place, I think everything has the green light. I am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way. I’m not saying no one will be offended, doesn’t make it less funny for some either. 

There is nuance, there is talent when it comes to jokes. Not everyone can write and or perform them as well as others.

So let’s see if you can come up with something that I have not found humorous."
CMV: making DeepFake pornography illegal is ableist.,"Some people can visualize their thoughts better than others. Some have wider imaginations and some have better abilities to draw pictures than others.

Using an app to draw something isn't any different than paper and pencil, and neither is applying a filter while drawing, or grabbing an object to throw in your image that you didn't draw yourself, see where I'm going with this? I don't think inputting my own thoughts into software that draws the image for me is any different.

If I'm taking care of my own business and I think of a celebrity while doing that (obviously without their consent) is that illegal? What if I write erotica to read about them? or draw that erotica? or make it with a computer (DeepFake)?"

CMV: I dont have any respect for people’s religious beliefs or gender identity,"I try really hard every day to have respect for both of these things but it’s getting harder and harder as the days go by 
people have use religion for some of the most outlandish shit I’ve ever seen 
whether its praying a disease away
Banning media because it goes against your beliefs
discriminating against your own family 
to torturing children
Religion is a plague on our planet and just like any problems in front of me it should be removed violently and with the most amount of effort possible and I don’t see how anyone could possibly tolerate it
Like I get the whole or give me the people need something to believe in but that’s bullshit considering this is going on underneath religious services people need to learn to stop believing in general and just accept reality for what it is so that they can improve it in the future responsibly
In terms of gender identity i’m really trying  to understand bro like is it that important like does it really matter what gender you are besides when you have to go to the public restroom or for reproduction purposes
 I don’t know Its just was kind of blown out of proportion for me  like people take this shit so seriously dude i’m talking about the people Who make there sex or gender about their entire lives are some of the most shallow people I’ve ever met  And it’s like I hear about it so often wear to the point where it’s like I don’t give a fuck and I don’t know if that’s like a bad thing because when I look up online and even when I interact IRL it’s such a big fucking deal to be an “ally“ but I truly do not care so I can’t really consider myself this “ally” especially since I don’t know what’s really going on Underneath all the banners and flag waving."
"CMV: If You’re Struggling With People Not Using Your Pronouns, It’s Probably Your Fault","EXCEPTIONS: If you are dealing with people who knew you pre transition and if your pronouns AREN’T she/her or he/him.

If you are transgender, you should put in the work to pass as the gender you feel connected with. Even Mike Tyson could pass as a woman (albeit a very ugly one) with the right makeup, hair, and outfit. 

As a trans person, if you’re constantly struggling with new people not respecting your pronouns, the issue is likely with you. If you truly identify with the opposite gender, then you must recognize that your inherent features look masculine/feminine and that you have to put in extra work to make them less apparent than someone cisgendered. And if you’re not willing to go that extra step, then I’d question whether or not you’re really trans.

At the end of the day, gender is a social construct. If you feel so strongly with one manmade social construct over another that you would be willing to undergo permanent life altering surgery to be recognized as that other gender, then putting in the work to look the part should be easy. 

If you think “no matter how I look, people should accept, respect, and acknowledge my gender identity” then that’s fine and well, but pretty much the sole component of the social construct of gender is your physical appearance. Genders are, at their core, physical archetypes. Nobody can see your chromosomes and behavior dictates nothing. If you don’t care to put in the work to change yourself physically, then you’re probably not trans."
CMV: I don't agree with my poop being turned into fuel-bricks,"In my country, when you drop a turd it goes to the treatment plant where the toilet paper is ground into the poop and a chemical is added to make them bind completely. The matter is then formed into brick shapes and has a burning time and measured energy output to it.

These poop bricks (without my permission) are sold by the guberment to shady companies all around the world to operate random things. I feel kind of bad my poop is fuelling machinery that makes things used to harm people, e.t.c There is a crony using my poop to make money and counting his cash and laughing, while a cigar hangs from his mouth. 

I also heard that these poop bricks are supposed to be ""good for the planet"" as recycling waste for energy, but when you burn them don't they make pollutants? What is going on here and why are they stealing my turds and think it is OK."
cmv: sex is fundamentally gross,[removed]
cmv: I don't understand on why pronouns mean so much to transgender people.,"So  I tend to not judge people for how they feel. I have always been able  to accept two gay males or two gay females loving each other. Or even a  male transitioning into a female and a male transitioning into a female  because people who can transition to another gender scientifically is  possible.

But the whole  identifying people are ""they"" ""them"" with their pronouns is the most  ridiculous thing to me with this whole gender war happening in the world  today especially in the USA today.

You  can live life how you generally please. Females don't need  to be child  bearers. And males don't need to be this masculine male that people .

So  I don't understand why someone feels the need to be addressed with a   particular set of pronouns. To me, it's like ok, I can call you that,   but then it seems to me that you're just doubling down on the idea that  rigid gender differences do matter. Which I don't think they do. You're   just you, an individual person. And all this crap people give with he  and she since it is what we've been using for a long time, so I don't  see how a different  pronoun will change anything that matters.

With  the logic from this it means that i can identify as a turkey sandwich  or a 99 year old female because the same concepts apply to what gender means to these people.

I don't mean to sound rude to people but scientifically it has never at all made sense to me so"

"CMV: Debating about ""robots rights"" outside the realm of science fiction is ridiculous","I love robot stories. I think it's really interesting to think about how robots would be integrated in our society, from the most basic ones to complex IAs that could perfectly mimic human behaviour. It's an interesting thought-experiment that can also serve really well as social commentary.

But that's what it is for me: fiction. I can't take the idea of robots having rights seriously. A robot, no matter how advanced, complex and human like, would be nothing more than a home appliance. It would be a human creation, just like cars or microwaves, not a human, not an animal, they wouldn't even be sentient, just lines of codes mimicking human behaviour and thinking, depending solely on our tendency to anthropomorphize non-human things. Giving robots rights is no different than giving an intelligent blender rights.

I often see discussions about robots popping up here and there, with some fervent defendants that they should have rights as long as they reach the point where they ""act just like humans"" (which is a problematic view for whole other reasons, like ""what does acting like humans mean? So less intelligent robots that couldn't pass as humans wouldn't have rights? Why not?""), but for me a robot with human like intelligence still holds less value than a fly (of course, I'm talking about the ""value of life"" here, not monetary or personal importance)."
"CMV: I believe that U.S. Organ Donation Should be a soft Opt-out system, not opt-in."," 

This argument was probably already said before. But organ donation is something I feel like everyone should do. I know some hard opt-out policies infringe on individual body liberties and choices(government taking) and also religious complications. It was stated that 95% of Americans are in favor of organ donations, but only 58% are actually registered (Donor Network West 2023). So how do we get the 37% of people to register to donate? A Soft Opt-out organ donation system, where everyone is defaulted “presumed” to want to be an organ donor. Those who do not want to donate would be able to opt-out easily through a nationwide website registry. Under this opt out policy:

* Those who are above 18 will be automatically added to a donor registry
* Those who are under 18 will still need parental consent to be added to the donor registry, but will automatically be added once they are 18.
* Individuals who are unable to make their own decisions will still be added to the donor network registry, but their Next of Kin or legal guardian can opt-out for them.
* To be added to the registry you need to be a US citizen or have a SSN
* Anyone during anytime can opt-out of becoming an organ donor
* During a death of a patient who did not opt-out, a representative from a donor network will talk to the family and “authorize” the default of donation in terms of the status quo. This gives the family an opportunity to ensure the potential donor’s preferences are regarded, in the event they have not opted out for whatever reason.

I feel like this is similar to the current opt-in system. Where if someone dies, whether they are a donor or not, a representative from a donor network still goes and asks about organ donation. But in the opt-out system, a representative goes and authorizes the default decision of organ donation if the person did not opt out. This principle goes on the assumption that people will just go with the default choice on what society normally does. By normalizing organ donation, we can increase the number of organ doners.

It can make the Next of Kin less stressed during this time because they do not need to think about what person actually wanted, because if they didn't want to donate they would have opted out. In the event the Next of Kin does not want to donate(and the deceased did not opt out), then we would go by what the Next of Kin wanted (similar to the current organ donation process). I feel like this would be the best of both worlds policy. It may increase the organ donation pool in a sense that people will want to go by the status quo, but still take into consideration family and religious views, so they can opt out for the deceased.

Would there be any downsides to this policy?"

CMV: There is nothing wrong with using AI for schoolwork," I believe so long as you don't plagiarize and have it complete your work for you, there's nothing unethical about using AI to assist you with homework. I used it to give me an idea for a thesis statement, noted sections of the book where the concepts where spoken of but wrote the overall paper on my own and as such it is my work.

To me this is no different from using a calculator, the internet, or going to the library and getting help from a librarian. Like it or not AI is going to become a mainstream tool and we should be embracing the tools that will be used as society progresses. 

So if AI assist people in learning, banning it from usage means you just want to make things harder rather that assist the person in learning to me."
CMV: It’s not people’s individual fault they’re obese.,"I know this is gonna ruffle some feathers. The obesity epidemic is real. The top 3 most used medications in the US are for diabetes and high blood pressure. 

I used to be obese. I’ve lost almost 90lbs. There is a strong narrative that people who are fat are lazy and it’s all their fault they’re fat. If you just eat less and exercise more that you’ll be thin. There’s an extreme amount of scrutiny and stigma around weight. I’d even say there are few things in society that’s seen as worse than being fat.

The thing is I don’t believe it’s people’s personal fault they’re fat in over 90% of cases. I’d argue almost all obesity is caused by metabolic disease and malnutrition in our regular diets. Some people react more poorly to that diet than others genetically. I think there are some more prone to metabolic disease. Why can some eat candy and KFC be just fine and others not? 

Metabolic disease is caused by sugar, white bread, pasta, white rice and other processed carbs. Metabolic disease causes Constantly high insulin levels and fat on the organs begin WAAAY before anything shows up as off on regular tests from a doctor. You can have high insulin for 25 years before you’re diabetic. Id wager almost all obese people have pretty high insulin levels, even if they think they’re healthy now. 

What happens when your insulin levels are high? Constant hunger, malabsorption of vitamins, and the body quickly packing on fat as the metabolism can no longer turn calories into energy. Cells become damaged. Like a viscous cycle the more you eat, the hungrier you feel, the higher your blood sugar, the hungrier you are, the less your body can absorb nutrients and so on. As someone who’s experienced it myself it feels like you’re dying, you’re starving to death. Your brain is in panic, screaming to eat. Yet you’re becoming fatter and fatter.

Much like famine, obesity is very much an issue of the government and politics promoting a deadly diet. Think of Victorian diseases like rickets or scurvy caused by poor diet and poverty. Do we shame them the same way?

Our food is pumped full of sugar and processed to the point it’s leeched of all nutrition. Corporations like nestle started the trend of added sugar in the 80’s from the fat free fad, other corporations added sugar to keep up competively in the market. Because sugar tastes good. 

If you look at nutrition labels you’ll be SHOCKED how much carbs and sugar is in almost everything. Doctors rarely give helpful nutritional advice because they aren’t trained well in it. There’s very few resources and very little education. 

By the time you’re obese you have to be extremely strict, you can’t go out to eat with friends, you have to focus most of your life to weight loss. It is extremely difficult, and very slow. 

Obesity is complex. It is not calories in vs calories out most of the time.

Even if someone is overeating it’s not their fault directly. But the fault of addictive food, and hormonal issues that make the brain go haywire and disease. It’s the fault of no education, the fault of poverty. The fault of big sugar (a food that has zero nutritional value) yet is in almost everything from wheat bread to pasta sauce. 

I can guarantee is it was easy to not be obese no one would be. Everyone who is over weight would press a button to be thin if they could.




No one wants to be fat, no one is happy being fat. You are told 24/7 you’re worth less, deserve less and are unattractive. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves. 

If everyone could just be thin, they would be. 

The problem is our food. The amount of processed food and sugar is insane.

CMV: Economic systems have negative impact on society... but that's not really their problem.,"I've been reading a lot of CMV complaining about how Capitalism has a negative impact on society. Things like a decrease in general mental health, an abused work force and etc. And I agree with all of it! 

The thing I'm on the fence about is ... I don't really see how that's something we can blame on our chosen economic system since... well it was never it's goal in the first place.

Isn't an economics system sole goal to dictate how goods are produced and distributed and attempt to maximize the output? All the economics system I know of have some variance on how this is achieved, but the goal remains the same. The mission statement isn't ""Make everyone happy"" it's ""Make as much product/money as possible"". So that's really the only reasonable criteria upon which  we can criticize capitalism - ""Does it maximize production?""

It doesn't seem reasonable to blame a fruit tree for making a shitty tasting fruit... well yeah, it's goal was never to feed you in the first place... it's goal was to spread it's seed. Can't fault it for making a fruit not edible to humans.

I guess ultimately - my POV is : you can't blame XYZ economic system for being shitty based on societal issues, it wasn't designed to handle those issues.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : You can't blame Capitalism for being shitty to people, if it's goal was never to \*not\* be shitty to people."

"CMV: ""Trumps"" Banking Deregulation was NOT a bad thing","I've been seeing a lot on Reddit that Trump caused the recent banking failure because he passed the 2018 Economic Growth Act, and that he was deregulating banks which caused this crisis. It seems most people didn't even read the bill or understand why it was recommended by researchers at Harvard Kennedy School (people much smarter than that orange baboon). This was done for reasons outside MAGAland.

Since the Dodd-Frank Act got passed all banks with more than $10 billion in assets were treated much the same way; this is good right? All banks get regulated? Well, there were more second-order effects than regulators realized; these banking regulations were applied to tiny, regional, and commercial banks even though they had nothing to do with the MBS shenanigans that resulted in the financial crisis. 

**Regional and community banks had nothing to do with the financial crisis.** These are the banks that service communities and sectors that high finance regularly avoids. They did not have capital markets desks that traded MBS or speculated in OTC derivatives. They were focused on lending to mom and pop shops and helping fund their local communities in rural, more agriculture focused areas. For example, over 50% of small business loans made in the US were serviced by these community and regional banks and over 70% of agriculture loans were issued by regional banks. These banks only hold **20**% of the total capital in the financial sector. These banks focus on places that JP Morgan and Goldman don't give a shit about. 

Regulations were killing small banks' ability to compete and were leading to a rapid concentration of wealth among the biggest banks; 

JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, etc. 

Regulators and researchers feared that having most of the wealth in the country concentrated in these banks would lead to increased wealth inequality as the regional and community banks were the only banks available in low-income communities, historically disenfranchised communities, and agricultural communities that did not have access to these financial giants.

The regulations crippled small banks' ability to compete with large banks in a number of ways: One is that the vast number of regulatory compliance that Dodd-Frank enacted required massive compliance departments and legal teams that banks like JP Morgan could stomach the costs for, while a smaller bank would be completely gutted by. For example, hiring just two compliance officers **reversed** the profitability of a smaller bank. 

JP Morgan has over **4 trillion** in assets. *A smaller regional bank would have less than 1% of that.*

The SVB debacle was caused by rising interest rates making the bank's HTM securities hit badly; SVB wasn't trading Dogecoin or some other random nonsense; it was holding GOVERNMENT bonds. This was a Black Swan Event not caused by simple deregulation, but rather a lack of analysis by the government and poor management by the bank caused by a decade of low rates and optimism. SeekingAlpha and short seller Marc Cohodes rang the alarm on SVB months ago, why did the government not step in a long time ago, isn't that their job? 

LCR requirements were on banks of over $75 billion in assets, shouldn't their liquidity coverage ratio have triggered alarm bells for regulators? Other risk-based capital ratios were also required and SVB was not going under the radar as it WAS a category 3 bank. **This was not a regulatory failure.** 

The SVB case would be an entirely different post, looking at their HTM portfolio, balance sheet, and how it created a prisoner's dilemma in which Peter Thiel would trigger a bank run. It wasn't a 2008 situation where the bank did some goofy NINJA loans nonsense and went under. 

Big banks WANT regulators to pass more bills and restrictions on regional banks; it hurts their competition and makes capital flee to the big banks. Hurting commercial and regional banks hurts the little guy, and in many ways it might even hurt you, dear reader.

Reposts are good - or certainly ok - for these users because they can just scroll past stuff they’ve already seen and they’re less likely to miss good stuff that they haven’t seen.

CMV: Relying on citations and studies ruins discussion,"To be clear, I'm more specifically referring to discussion about topics related to politics, economics, social issues, etc. I'm not saying citations and studies are completely worthless in these areas, like if you are writing a research paper, you obviously need to have these things. I'm more so talking about general discussions. There are a number of issues with relying on citations and studies. 

(1) No matter how hard academia tries to pretend these subjects are scientific, they just aren't. Attempts to use the scientific method for the humanities is honestly kind of a joke. For one, the studies conducted in these fields aren't always concrete or reliable. They are often heavily flawed in the methodology and can pretty easily be manipulated by biasses and agendas. Data can also pretty easily be misrepresented and misinterpreted. Generally speaking, people don't form their opinions on these topics based on studies. Rather, they form their opinions and then look for anything that confirms their bias. 

(2) The majority of people who use citations and studies in more casual discussions are disingenuous in how they go about it. They don't do deep dives into these studies and really analyze them properly. Usually, they just look for something on Google and spam the link. In reality, it takes hours and hours of labor to actually properly understand a study, and nobody is actually going to do this in a casual discussion. Not the people who are providing the citation, nor the people who are being provided to. 

(3) It's just not persuasive. When it comes to more casual discussions, throwing a bunch of links at people is never going to actually change anyone's view or genuinely persuade someone. Logic, rhetoric, personal experience, etc. are much more persuasive. It's fine if you want to incorporate some statistics into your argument, but you need the other things to actually get through to people. Simply saying, ""ahkshually, this study says...."" serves no purpose other than an attempt to one up somebody and likely annoy them. There's a reason why most politicians don't just get in front of a podium and give voters a reading list of academic peer reviewed studies. 

(4) It's just boring. A discussion that devolves into a Google search contest isn't engaging or interesting."
CMV: Society shouldn't view that real girlfriends are better than waifus as it creates gender inequality,"&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

You get to choose what she's like

She can be your motivation

She won't reject you

Won't cheat

Cons:

Rejection

Most girls expect you to be a mind reader

She can cheat on you

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a Waifu &gt; Gf post, rather I listed out the pros/cons as an outline for what I'm about to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

People often make the argument that a waifu, a fictional character in your imgination can't do real life stuff with you. 

All your ""Pros"" are essentially something that you imagine is a common argument I seen. 

However the claim ""Real girls are better than waifus because with a real girl you can have a ""real"" connection. 

Many people while making that claim don't realize that their warrant is ""Real life things are more important than digital things."" 

Have you guys, who say that claim ever considered the reality, versus the digital world?  


In real life, you have no control

Girls in real life are playing the digital world game. They're the one choosing while you're the one chasing.

What I'm trying to say is, in society men don't get the choice. Once you go into a digital world, you \*experience\* what a girl experiences in real society. It becomes much easier to date whoever you want which is what a girl experiences. 

Essentially, your warrant falls apart because in reality, you're playing the game but digitally you're the game's master. 

Girl's are inherently the game's master when it comes to dating, they have the rules, they have the ability to change it. People say waifus are bad because realistically they don't want girls to lose the title of being the Game's master. Once men start to prefer wiaifus over ""real gfs"" girls switch places, they will become a player while boys become the Game's master. 

In the age of equality between gender, we should no longer give females all the admin powers in dating. When society starts to accept waifus as a legitimate relationship it will help us achieve the equality in dating we been looking for. GIrls should have a standard to compete for, and waifus are perfect. Society might not accept the truth yet, but the fact is that men spend thousands on Gacha games just for waifus, rather than on a real girl."
CMV: we should not be blaming Tems for obscuring people's views at the Oscars with her dress.,"Social media was crazy this morning blaming Tems for her huge dress which may have blocked the views of people behind her. And people are being really aggressive about it on Reddit and Twitter. This aggression, in my opinion, is unfounded. What's more, I think it is premature to blame her at all. Here's my reasoning:

1) If she was given the design beforehand, there is no reason to assume that she knew better. This is her first year being well known, whereas previously she was an unknown musician from Africa. I don't know anyone who has ever worn a dress that has a collar higher than their head. It's not exactly a common thing. So would the average person be able to immediately see from a design that that would be obstructing someone's view? Hard to say. Especially if you are not used to wearing performative pieces and going to events like that. If you were exceptionally tall, or usually wear hats, then maybe you would think of it. But as it stands, I have yet to be convinced that the average person would anticipate this.


2) Once she got the dress, if she noticed it was too large, that would have been too late. For the most part, actresses do not wear dresses that they own to the Oscars. They sign a contract with a designer to showcase a dress. Often these dresses cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make. So at that point she couldn't have just not worn it and could even have been sued for doing so. 

3) Lastly, some people have commented online that Tems should have pushed the dress down or changed seats. You don't know if either of those were actual options. Changing seats probably would have been impossible for an event like that, and pushing the dress down could have damaged it. Plus, it's not even clear that the people behind her even _mentioned_ to her that they could not see. That is just pure speculation at this point"
CMV: TikTok is more detrimental than beneficial to nursing as a whole.,"TikTok has since it’s inception been more detrimental to nursing as a career than helpful in my personal opinion. I understand that devils advocate will utilize the educational TikToks but other platforms are more helpful in education (YouTube) as they offer more time to go in depth over concepts. The disadvantages far outweigh the benefits. As someone who’s spent over a decade trying to advocate nursing as a career; seeing those in overly tight scrubs acting dramatic; doing dances ect seems more like a desperate cry for attention than wayward nurses trying to connect. Influencer culture as a whole is toxic and gives adults and children completely unrealistic outlooks on what’s acceptable and unacceptable in and out of the workplace. It’s profoundly challenging to tell society respect me for my mind; then a new grad doesn’t wear underwear while twerking on the clock. It’s hard to tell patients to respect us when we act like children talking about Icks in OB, crying over a patient dying for clout in the ICU or making fun of pediatric GSW patients. All 3 of these scenarios were nationally and some internationally publicized. I really want to know why nurses aren’t more critical about their colleagues filming TikToks that damage the career as a whole. I think we need to hold ourselves and peers more accountable for society’s perspective on us. Any to those saying they’ll judge anyway; why actively give and condone more fuel for the fire?"

CMV: People make too big of a deal about tipping culture,"I get it, you’re already spending seven dollars on a coffee but if you’re doing that you probably have a dollar or two more to spare, however that’s not even my main point.

So often I hear people saying, “tipping culture has gotten out of hand.” I don’t agree with capitalism or the way we currently treat service workers and agree that businesses should 100% foot the bill to pay employees a living wage. However, that is not the system we currently live under and in the real world today, most service workers do not make a living wage and rely heavily on tips.

Here’s my thing; nobody is making you tip. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But it irks me when people are anti-tip but try to spin it into being a workers rights thing. No, you’re not tipping because you believe employers should pay their workers more and you think they deserve a living wage. You’re not tipping because you simply don’t want too. That’s fine, but don’t try to make it sound like you are some kind of pro-worker amazing person. When you don’t tip a server you are essentially screwing them over in the current system because nobodies rising up to change how restaurants pay them. 

I get it more for other businesses but again, nobodies making you tip. I think it’s good that more businesses are offering tip options. Should it be necessary? No. But in the system we live under I think it’s great that there’s an option, option being the key word, for a barista or cashier to make a dollar or two more during a transaction. 

If you feel like it do it, if you don’t then don’t. But when people just outright dismiss tipping as a whole it makes me think you just don’t want to feel guilty for not doing it and you put that higher than the positives it can bring for the worker. I think it’s good in todays system for there to be an option for people to make a little more money."
CMV: Progressives and LGBT people are just as fanatical and dogmatic as evangelicals and conservatives.,"Much of the debate/culture war on Reddit and elsewhere seems to be between pro-LGBT progressives and evangelical Christian conservatives. However, it seems to me that many progressives claim to be ideologically neutral and base their beliefs on science. But science only tells us facts about how biology and chemistry function, science doesn't tell us how to think or feel about anything. I've got the argument several times that I ought to be an LGBT ally because science. Science doesn't dictate what political causes or ideology I support.

I keep mentioning LGBT because it seems that if you're not religious nowadays then your sexuality and gender identity that defines you. Why? Why is that so important? Isn't that arbitrarily dogmatic?

Like isn't the attitude of ""thou shalt be an affirming ally"" or ""thou shalt be pro-choice"" just as dogmatic as an actual religious commandment. Why do I owe anyone solidarity? Is there some kind of pro-LGBT deity I don't know about?

Also, if there us no God or deities, then why should I have any morals? What is right and wrong then? Arbitrary cultural concepts. One nation's taboo is another nation's normal. It's not like there's a good or bad afterlife to worry about.

Speaking of afterlife, my last point of contention is that modern progressivism is like the secular equivalent of Calvinism. People who are a part of some oppressed group are among the ""saved"" and those who are not allies ought to be ""damned"" through social scorn and maybe doxxing their workplace and blacklisting them from finding another job."

CMV: Both Political Parties are Equally Responsible for the Division in America and We Need More Civil Conversation,"I would like to first clarify that I identify as an independent. And no, before someone else says it, I am not just a Republican who wants to skip church and smoke weed. For me, it’s more about recognizing that we are all multifaceted individuals with unique experiences and opinions that can not be defined by a single word.

We live in a society where disagreement is inevitable. It is perfectly normal to have different beliefs, values, and ideas about the world. However, it is becoming increasingly common to see people resorting to personal attacks and demonizing those with different opinions, and I find that unacceptable. This does not foster healthy discussions and debates, but instead only fuels division and animosity towards one another.

There is a great divide in this country. It seems as though nearly every post I read on social media creates a narrative about how the other side is evil, corrupt, and driven by sinister motives. It is important to understand everyone has a unique set of experiences that shape their opinions and beliefs. The reality is that we are all human beings who believe we are doing what is right.

Republicans call Democrats unintelligible socialists who want to destroy America. Democrats call Republicans heartless insurrectionists who want to destroy America. It is important to recognize there is a broad spectrum of political ideologies, not two groups of people who fit into a stereotype. No matter which side you voted for, half of the country disagrees. I can assure you from my experience as an American, half of the country is not evil. The truth is that we all are just people. People who care about our family, friends, neighbors, and country.

Even when we disagree with one another, it does not make the other side bad people. We need to show civility in our approach to changing the perspectives of others, even to the people who hold views we find abhorrent. Vilifying people who hold different opinions only serves to further entrench our differences and diminish our opportunities to solve problems.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the complex problems we have in this country. Having civil conversations is the only way to gain a better understanding of each other’s perspectives. It allows us to explore the nuance of these issues, find common ground, and identify where compromise is possible. When our beliefs are being attacked, it is easy to become frustrated and angry. But a willingness to learn with an open mind may help us realize that our disagreements are not as irreconcilable as we first thought. We may have more in common than we realize.

Let me end with this: When was the last time you had a civil conversation with someone you disagreed with? When was the last time you listened to what they had to say, rather than just waiting for your turn to speak? For many of us, I suspect it has been a while. Not everyone will be willing to hear you out, but we should still strive to engage in productive conversations that promote understanding and mutual respect.

It's important to clarify that my intention is not to promote tolerance towards racism, homophobia, misogyny, or xenophobia. Rather, I believe that we should work towards changing these harmful perspectives but do so in a way that does not involve attacking or demonizing individuals who hold these views. The Civil Rights Movement, Women’s Suffrage and Rights Movements, 1920’s Labor Movement and LGBTQ+ Rights Movement all found some success through peaceful protest and conversations. People can change their minds, but only if you allow them an opportunity to."

cmv: I think that the existence of closed spaces exclusively for people of a marginalized identity is not inherently a bad thing.,"There is this ongoing discourse about the existence of closed spaces for members of specific marginalized communities and a lot of progressives will say this is “self-segregation” or regressive. Let me say that I know there are people who, because of trauma or past experiences or honestly because sometimes people are just shitty, are way too eager to turn the tables and exclude the people groups who previously excluded them and I agree that insofar as that is the motivation, it is not something I support.

However, there are plenty of legitimate reasons why marginalized people would want to have spaces primarily or even exclusively designed to cater to their needs and shared experiences because the wider world is still not safe for them. 

People from more mainstream identities (read: cis/het and white) may get legitimately upset by feeling excluded (exclusion is an ugly feeling), but they inhabit a world that is mostly built to cater to their needs and shared experiences so it’s not like they don’t have anywhere else to belong. Plus, a lot of times these spaces will welcome people outside their in-group so long as the guests don’t take up too much physical or emotional space in them. Maybe the most I am willing to sympathize with their perspective is that closed spaces not be intentionally hurtful when establishing and protecting boundaries.

I think a lot of the discomfort from (mostly) white, cis/het progressives is that they are afraid that bigots could use similar rationalizations to try to re-establish whites-only, or straights-only spaces or whatever, but truth is:

1) these things already exist (how many Black people do you see at country clubs, or how many gay people can be themselves openly at evangelical churches?) 

And

2) marginalizing someone because of their identity is NOT the same as having a space that caters to people who share a common experience of marginalization."

CMV: Humanity doomed itself the moment it accepted slavery as a viable concept,"It's my opinion that humanity is doomed to fail at some point. If you look at it as a game, we lost the moment we decided slavery was okay in any form, but especially in a systemic form. There are ways to achieve and construct things by treating people fairly and not using others as machines or animals. Slavery showed human's darkest instincts and behaviors. These things are clearly still in us and it's why we won't ever conserve this planet to our benefit or even escape it to another. Racism is just one issue, but it's more about the lack of trust we have in each other. The damage caused by slavery is still felt today and it becomes part of our identity because these instincts somehow still live in us. We would have to permanently transcend our darkest impulses to ascend to a sustainable existence of peace and trust, but when trust is broken it can often never be rebuilt."

"CMV: It doesn't matter which economic or political system we use to try to manage humanity and civilisation. So long as there are humans involved, we will corrupt it.","There is no such thing as a perfect (or likely even near perfect) system for the governance of human populations which is directly managed by humans that doesn't become significantly corrupt over time. 

I have had many arguments with people who believe that communism would be a better system for managing large populations but what these people never seem to take into account is that so long as it is a system managed by humans, it will inherently lean towards corruption to one degree or another. 

I believe the best system we can create is one that manages to dissipate the negative impacts of centralised power, thus creating a society that leans towards corruption as little as possible, while also recognising that regardless of what system we implement, this tendency will always be there so long as the system is run by humans. 

Case in point, I feel like democracy and capitalism do a reasonably good job of achieving this. It distributes elective power to the people while also distributing economic power through free markets. Yet what we see happening now is the corruption of this system due to the consolidation of political choice due to very limited party choices in most western countries along with economic consolidation caused by corporatism which is rapidly taking over capitalism. 

I believe a possible, if highly risky, solution to this is to allow highly intelligent AI to manage our political and economic systems as this takes humans mostly out of the question. But of course, which humans program the AI and give it its aims and goals then becomes the issue, yet this solution, I believe, still has the best possibility of helping humans to thrive as a species."

cmv: Protesting against drag show for kids on its own doesn't makes you a Nazi.,"I am angry. Angry that the conversation about drag shows for kids has been reduced to a black and white discussion of either supporting them or being labeled a Nazi. It's not that simple. There are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed, and it's unfair to dismiss them as merely rooted in transphobia.

1.Let's start with the fact that children are not capable of fully comprehending adult themes and concepts. Drag shows are meant to be subversive and push boundaries, but that doesn't mean they're appropriate for kids. As adults, we have a responsibility to recognize that some activities are age-appropriate, and drag shows don't fall into that category. It's not about hating or fearing trans people; it's about protecting children's development and well-being.

2. I have is the exploitation of children for political purposes. I worry that some individuals are using drag shows aimed at children as a way to indoctrinate them into certain beliefs and ideologies. This is not okay. Children should be allowed to develop their own beliefs and values, not be forced into a particular ideology. It's a form of child abuse to impose political views on them.

3.safety is a legitimate concern. Drag shows can attract individuals who might not have the best intentions towards children. Allowing children to attend such events could put them at risk of encountering predators or other dangerous individuals(you know who I mean but I don't think that p word is allowed here). It's our responsibility as adults to protect children from harm, and allowing them to attend events that could put them in harm's way is not acceptable.

Labeling those who voice these concerns as Nazis or bigots is unfair and unhelpful. It's important to have open and honest discussions about these issues without resorting to name-calling or insults. We need to acknowledge that there are legitimate worries about the safety, well-being, and development of children when it comes to drag shows for kids. It's not a simple matter of either supporting them or not.

That's not to say I agree with what the right side is doing. They are explicitly against drag show for all kids. I don't agree with that. I can understand if you think that your child would expand their horizon by witnessing diverse community like drag shows.lets say The same way you have reasons to show your kids in the drag show i have reasons to not. I however am not against what you do with your ward and i expect the same from you."

CMV: The new prevalence of remote work is bad for anybody who doesn't WFH,"I live in North Idaho, in a city that used to be almost entirely blue collar. Rural lifestyle, conservative politics, all that. It's always been a bit of a resort town, and then a few years ago a huge number of celebrities bought vacation homes here and drove thousands of people to move here.

I'll preface the rest of this by saying I am *not* a Conservative and my ideology aligns with very few of my neighbors. I'll also say that while I'm specifically talking about my city, this has happened to any notable city in the West, including Montana, Wyoming, Utah, smaller cities in Washington and Oregon, and so on.

In my area, there's always been a general dislike among locals towards people who move in from other states, namely California, Washington, and Oregon. A lot of that dislike was/is based in the idea that people from blue states would somehow corrupt Idaho's politics, which wasn't, and isn't, the case.

The other reason people have been wary of outsiders is because we know they're bringing big money with them. Even before the pandemic, people were selling their homes in California and building McMansions worth five times the median home price here. Obviously that helps the economy of the city and state, but it has driven a huge increase in the wealth gap here for over a decade. 

However, it wasn't a *significant* problem until 2020, when the widespread adoption of work from home policies led droves of people to move to more ""affordable"" cities, especially those with excellent outdoor access and reasonable proximity to bigger cities. I'm sure part of that is driven by the new-ish trendiness of ""wellness"" and the general fetishization of the aesthetics of outdoor, healthy life. There's a cryotherapy spot downtown now, a few vitamin IV places, countless juice bars, and *so much yoga.* I'm not saying I hate these things, but nobody I know who's from here is into that stuff. I also don't hate the people who move here - I totally understand (and unfortunately now empathize with) the idea of moving to a more affordable city.

Anyway, my rent has literally doubled since the pandemic. My parents' house's value doubled. Hotels were booked out because people trying to move here were waiting for a home to buy or rent. Several friends and coworkers were priced out of the city (population 55,000, I might add). Property taxes have become untenable for some. The second an older home goes on the market, it's bought and flipped. There's no opportunity for upward mobility for almost any local. There's no affordable city to move to within a few hundred miles, because people from here fled to them and most of them were equally affected by the crisis.

I know that work from home isn't the sole reason for the housing crisis (which has affected most of the US), but I strongly believe it has played a leading role in the problems we now face. People like myself, my family, my friends, my neighbors, who used to be able to lead a comfortable, affordable life, have been squeezed out of the middle class (which, I know, has been shrinking for decades) to the point of near-poverty. The income gap here is unbelievable now, and I'm sure it's the same in many other cities. Remote work made up 61% of work in 2020, and now sits at 29%."
CMV: Being popular in high school / college is actually important,"Sometimes, I hear people saying stuff like high school / college popularity doesn't matter in the real world. I honestly think this is copium from people who weren't popular. Obviously, there are some people who peaked in high school or college, and others who were losers that end up becoming successful later in life. However, generally speaking, being popular is an important part of development and learning, and you are missing out if you weren't one of the popular kids. 

First of all, generally speaking, popularity comes from having good traits, such as being attractive, having good social skills, having a good personality, being good at sports, being funny, whatever. Being popular in high school and college is like the equivalent of smart kids getting good grades. It's a reward for doing well in certain areas. 

Second of all, being popular is an important part of development. You honestly learn a lot by having a ton of friends and an active social life when you are younger. It helps you develop even better social skills, which will continue to help you out later on in life. The earlier you start developing these skills, the better and more experienced you will be going forward. 

Third, it's helpful to start building a social circle and network of people you know early on in life. Even though you will drift apart with people over the years, it still provides a good foundation if you get the ball rolling early. The more people you know, the easier it becomes to meet new people. It's like a snowball effect. You start off by being popular in high school and college, and you will continue meeting more new people and making new connections than you would have otherwise. Even if you end up with completely different friend groups later on, it all traces back to having a lot of friends early on. Plus, in many cases, friends you made back in high school and college often become lifelong friends. 


Fourth, it just makes those years more fun in general. High school and college are some of the easiest places to make friends, and it's at a time in life where you most likely aren't a parent yet, and most of the people you know aren't parents yet. This is a great time to just have fun and enjoy it. Later on in life, people usually become busier, less available, plus more worn down in general. 

Overall, I'm sick of hearing some people pretend that popularity in high school / college isn't important. Obviously, grades are important too, but popularity is just as if not more important than getting good grades. As long as your grades are decent enough, you're good.

"CMV: Post-materialist political behavior is self-defeating, mis-directed rage against the machine, and will ultimately be viewed by future historians as a regressive social phenomenon.","Disclaimer: I am, in the spirit of the sub, presenting the most hard-line, shorthand version of the position. 

With that out of the way:

I posit that the steady subversion of traditional ""bread and butter"" political cleavages (in which lines are drawn largely along economic interests) by contemporary [post-materialist](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/54294170/j.1559-1816.1996.tb00085.x20170830-2804-1lttpw9-libre.pdf?1504128721=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DIngleharts_Materialism_Postmaterialism_C.pdf&amp;Expires=1678658213&amp;Signature=e~269xTD1XLfBXogcCRoXQgjOV4lWIqb8UsAs51ERckUh96p0m61mosJNF3pTynrMfish42A~N1r3QFdT-SZ4Y98QZ6mBYquvJzQjtptfafjjXcvfTd0siat~PP92wmABVNpIRkuw6P-QNLkNem4Hpx~y6QdPpL94DUnJyNhvuSqQP6zp69iAf4We6SQV06WGXVRH0yhXpIZm9NjCWeV1KU1UlOdB2OH3sUbw5gr30Tt8jZ6r5k7o7BqxttYEVtVZwa0r7FRWUq7Oj0RBDjBFyI11qcUZ9zUxoUoMX1~pvhqaZ4AHL2-UpBxHXYgoUvNd3o9558fn8rZoJvI9MCd9w__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA), identitarian, values-based politics ultimately detracts from the debates that matter in an essentially zero-sum fashion. By directing political attention toward social fractures and neglecting systemic rot and economic issues pertaining to material conditions and democratized public welfare, participants are perpetuating the very conditions of uncertainty which till fertile ground for the sowing of social division and group in-fighting to begin with.

The primacy of post-material political identities allows political and economic elites/entities to continue engaging in transitively reciprocal activities (commonly referred to as ""influence-market-style corruption"") without citizen oversight or attention, and creates an environment where political capital can be won with ideological window-dressing rather than by demonstrating integrity of representation or even minimal competency at pushing for actual progress.

Obviously, this view is heavily vested in some utilitarian/quasi-Rawlsian thought, and more broadly in the basic assertion that social progress follows economic conditions (hell, everyone from Adams to Marx made this point in some capacity), but also in more idealist notions about social cohesion and the habituation of shared norms as being critical to the health of the polity. Additionally, it rests on more contemporary conceptions of racial/identity-based tensions as a illusion of projected, superficial divisions over what is, under the surface, [a class hierarchy or caste system.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/magazine/isabel-wilkerson-caste.html)

In broad strokes, my argument is this: If voters, and citizens more generally, would focus on and vote according to their checkbooks and holding the power-literate accountable rather than engaging in superfluous social infighting, they'd actually get to their value-based goals more efficiently. In a context where government is forced to uphold its end of the social contract, the resulting gains in material conditions, solutions of coordination and collective action dilemmas, increased stability of economic welfare, and reduction in the accelerant tensions of scarcity and disparity would allow for the freer and more efficient sharing of social norms and ultimately greater tolerance, acceptance, and mutual dignity (most romantically, a beautifully diverse, yet deeply unified, shared identity). 

Please make an argument either for the utility of contemporary post-materialist politics, against the power of general welfare to smooth out social cleavages, some combination thereof, or catch me in one of the 7 other holes that are in my argument."
CMV: I'm a real life mascot.,"You know, that pretty looking dude who cracks jokes and that everyone around even patpats on the head, genuinely likes to have around, invites to parties and other things friends invite friends to go? Someone who gives a good vibe and people cherish when they're around?

That's me.

But what's the problem in all of this?

Perhaps it's because my social circles nearly have no single girls, but I think i'm seen as a mascot. Childish, potentially. But people like me. So i'm a mascot. Everyone is dating except for me. I'm often jealous of my friends who have nice girls to build a life together. I've given up on sex totally - with guys or girls. I'm bisexual. It doesn't interest me anymore after years of not having anything at all, not even a kiss, and when I was lucky, it was a mess because I ended up with people with no experience like me and it was just messy due to the lack of experience of us both and therefore not satisfying to neither.

What do I have to do? Get a sign on my head that says ""i'm single""?

So this is why I say i'm a real life mascot. He's pretty, he's cool, he's nice to have around but he is undateable. ""unsexualized"", unable, simple as that."

CMV: Having children is selfish.,"A) Human consciousness can be painful in the world as it functions today, there are so many unsolvable sicknesses in human culture. These issues are unsolvable because there are simply too many people in the world that would need to cooperate and understand and respect each other. Humans were absolutely not equipped to become so populated. We have people feeling isolated, unfulfilled, manipulated. We can’t connect with how many people are actually involved in the structure of our way of life. The network of function is too big. Ideas are strongly divided because our realities are strongly different. 
I don’t see that improving anytime soon.

B) Overpopulation contributes to many social, economical, environmental, and mental damages.
I recognize that many people have children simply for the experience of raising a family, it’s what we were created to do, biologically, to love and to create and to build beautiful memories. But this is what seems selfish to me, choosing your own version of happiness over the improvement of the world.

"CMV: Politicians, the news Media, and even social media mods do not do enough to remind people that disliking/hating a foreign government should not be applied to citizens of those nations.","I am Chinese. I came here when I was two and grew up in this country. I went to school here. I work here. I pay my taxes. I do my part as a human of this planet to give back to charities and organizations that better the community, the world, and the earth.

What I am currently seeing by way of political rhetoric is that China is bad. And I recognize the US and China have had economic competition for decades but it seems now things are more tense than ever. I see it both from the left and the right. On Reddit, I often see 'fuck china' this and 'fuck china' that - even for non-political posts. It's pretty intense.   


Given the political climate, and angry rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum, along with some of the shit I have seen on Reddit, it has created some level of anxiety in me - both for traveling purposes and just being more apprehensive about acknowledging a part of me that is outside my control. I guess we generally use 'fuck (country)' colloquially to mean fuck that country's govt but now it seems that phrase has expanded to create a suspicion and hatred towards Asians.

I've travelled to different parts of the country and in predominantly white states, I get stares but I have not explicitly experienced any racism or prejudice - so far. That being said, I am a bit more apprehensive and cautious more than ever about traveling to certain parts of this country due to the rise of Asians being targeted with assault, etc, so it's definitely happening.

I'd like to think most Americans can separate hatred of the Chinese govt from Chinese citizens or Chinese people living in this country but I am not always confident in American exceptionalism due to some of the angry rhetoric I have seen in the news and media. Culturally, I am assimilated into the American experience with minimal exposure even to my own background, but no matter what I say or do, I ultimately have no control over my physical ethnic traits and how strangers might perceive me based on their own political views.

I fear that the lack of constant reminders from the news, politicians, social media platforms, means more people will blur the line or end up holding irrational prejudices against Chinese people - especially in America where people sometimes struggle with separating personal political values from an individual - sometimes even deliberately targeting Asians due to one's own political views. Even if one does not personally hate Chinese people, using language like 'Fuck China' seemingly only risks potentially extending that hatred beyond politics. We have seen this quite a bit with members of other minority groups. Since East Asians are distinctly and noticeably different compared to Caucasians, it is not easy to simply ""blend in.""

I suppose hating the CCP isn't anything new and there are many reasons to not like the CCP but with the rise of media coverage on Asian people being targeted, and politicians not seemingly doing enough to remind people to separate govt from the people, there seems to be an immediate negative reaction when people drop the word 'China' and often people can find it difficult to separate hating 'China (the govt)' from hating 'China (the people)'

My take is that both the left and right politicians are not doing enough to remind people to adopt rhetoric that might be more appropriate such as expressing hatred towards a political part instead of a country. 

Saying 'Fuck China' and 'Fuck the Chinese' seemingly encompasses the people, the culture, the good **vs** 'Fuck the Chinese Govt' or 'Fuck the CCP' 'Fuck Xi' which makes it far more clear that one's discontent is not with the people but rather only with the government.

Politicians and the news media can do more to help change the rhetoric and remind all of us to separate politics from the people. We all say we know it but it doesn't seem to be emphasized enough. I believe we should adopt an approach with the way we use our language that minimizes risks of people letting their political views against a government transfer to become prejudice or even racism against someone who might be from a certain country. Not just for China but with Iran, with Russia, or any state that we have deemed to be antithetical to America's values.

Some may argue free speech but I'd challenge these people if we can be more precise in our language if it means it can minimize potential fueling of hatred and racism, etc.

CMV: I think I’m smarter than I really am. All I do is just write halfway decent (and that’s maybe too much credit).,"This might be a bit of an odd change my view, but it’s something that I’ve been wondering about and struggling with. For this CMV, I’ll refer to conversations on Reddit since this is what got me thinking.

When it comes to expressing my opinions or ideas, I often find myself on the receiving end of a negative reaction, whether it’d be in real life or on the internet. And, often times, I find it rather strange because, many times, I agree with the person I’m talking to and describe why I do as such. But then I’m still told that I’m wrong, or on Reddit, continue to get downvoted, even with a minor disagreement. I’ve seen more incendiary takes that still get good amounts of support and positive feedback. But I often get drilled for expressing, what I think, is pretty much the same opinion, with maybe some trivial differences.

After thinking about it, I think this is because, subconsciously, I probably think I’m smarter than I really am. I use that I think best conveys my thoughts and opinions. But, in all honesty, it’s probably just a way to sound “intelligent” when making a dumb thought or opinion. I don’t do this consciously. It’s just the way I write or speak. But it seems that no one understands what I’m trying to say, and instead, try to tell me what I really think.  So, often times, I wonder “What is the source of the disagreement? Because we agree with pretty much everything, maybe just a minor point. [On Reddit] Why does this person continue to downvote me and continues on points that I didn’t even bring up?” I’ll reread over and over again what I had said and if I was being understood. But, in recent discussions on CMV, it seems that even after going through my comments and seeing that I did, indeed, tried to explain my view in the best way I could possible, I’ll still get downvoted, even when I’m 99% agreeing with the other person. Ultimately, I think this is because I’m writing I’m writing in a way that I think is both intelligent and understandable. But really, I’m just not that smart but I was trained to use big words and expressions, yet can’t connect them into coherent ideas.

Maybe I just need to stick to shorter sentences and paragraphs that are my level to being understood by others.

So, let’s see if you can change my view."

By setting limits on this it opens up what has been gated from most of society. When the land may not be monopolized by some oligarch, we should be able to distribute it effectively without being forced to live in these compounds called towns, and cities.

By setting a $5 million cap on individuals, as a well as, let's say three houses, and three cars/vehicles.

You should use headlights when driving on rainy / stormy days. I see people driving gray cars the blend into the road/rain with no headlights and I'm like ...what are you thinking? 

It literally involves a flick of the finger, extremely minimal effort.

CMV: I consider Christians to be frauds if they haven't read through the Bible at least once throughout their life.,"I've recently started reading the Bible (usually to fall asleep at night) and have made it halfway through Genesis. Whenever converse with Christians, it seems that many Christians have not delved deep into their religious text beyond simply reading scripture during Bible study. 

I am an agnostic, so I'm still exploring my own beliefs, but even if I were to believe in God, I don't think it would necessarily align with the Christian conception of a deity. Another reason I am reading through the bible is that many video games and media entertainment have religious references. For example, Assassin Creed: Odyssey and the God of War series made me more interested in studying Greek Mythology. I started to study Christian Mythology and have encountered interesting stories like Paradise Lost and the Tower of Babel, which had created a lot of insightful discussion with experienced Christians.

The Bible contains material that is fundamental to Christian belief, and it's generally considered important for Christians to read the Bible at least once in their lifetime. Many would argue that it's a crucial aspect of their faith. I estimate the Bible to be the length of about two Harry Potter novels, and many people in the world have read the Harry Potter series. 

Anyways, if they truly have faith in a deity, then why wouldn't they invest the time on learning about such deity? It doesn't make sense to me."

Instead, they are fixated on — almost obsessed with — transgender people, pronouns, critical race theory, investigating Dr. Fauci because they think he single-handedly created a worldwide pandemic etc. 

Banning books and passing anti-woke bills does not help any of us economically. Are public schools even teaching critical race theory or are the republicans passing bills to ban things that are not real? What does it even mean to be “woke”?

"CMV: All this AI tech is good, actually + AI art is real art.","Disclaimer: I don't think it's okay to steal art in order to build your AI. Privacy is important.

I see a bunch of CMVs about how all the new things about AI aren't that bad, implying that they think it's bad, just not \*very\* bad. Me, I think it's not bad at all. I actually think it's \*good\* and I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.

This is not the first time we see people lose their jobs or worry about losing their jobs because of new technology. It happened with the Industrial Revolution when dozens of farmhands got replaced by a single tractor, and countless of other examples out there.

It's not the first time something gets called ""not art"" because of how a machine was involved in its production. Back when photographs were new, people were malding about how photographs aren't real art, you just pressed a button and hurr durr I'm an artist. Nowadays we know better and professional photographers who do the photograph thing way better than I can exist and are paid for it. Although someone who can paint a picture manually tends to still be, to me, more impressive (when it comes to their skill) than a photographer who managed to take an outstanding picture.

See that previous paragraph? I believe AI artists work the same way. It's not easy to make AI art -- I've tried to do it and by god, is it tough. You need to choose the right words, find the right prompts, pick the right seed -- sometimes even different AIs (compare a different AI with a different camera) because NovelAI is good at a specific thing while, say, character dot ai is good at another -- and then you have to comb through several pictures. Like with being a photographer, it takes effort and it IS fascinating to see what people can do, \*even\* if manual pictures are still more impressive. ...Just like fabric, too! I love me some industrial clothings, but if my mom makes something I can buy on the store with her own hands? Holy smokes.

I don't think people losing their jobs for AI is an actual bad thing at a societal level; sure, it sucks for them and it'd suck for me if I were one of those people, but it's necessary. I'm not losing my job yet as a programmer but I eventually will, just like cars did to horses, and that's alright. Humans need not apply."

CMV: People shouldn't care so much about their gender identity,"For the record, I'm not only referring to trans and non-binary people. I'm also talking about, for example, men who are super obsessed with being manly, who make being a man such a huge part of their personal identity. Being this obsessed with gender is honestly just cringe, whether you are trans, non-binary, or cis. The idea of revolving your personality around gender identity is just kind of ridiculous. It really doesn't matter, and it's a silly thing to revolve your personality around. 

The way I see it, it doesn't really matter whether you are a male or a female, or a man or a woman or whatever, at least when it comes to your identity as a person. If I magically woke up tomorrow having the body of the opposite sex, I honestly wouldn't give a shit. I wouldn't complain about how I'm trapped in the wrong body or whatever, I'd just carry on as normal. 

Obviously, people do get treated differently and have different experiences based on their sex and/or gender, but at the end of the day, there are way more similarities than there are differences. We still eat the same food, we live in the same cities, we have access to all the same hobbies and interests, etc. It's like when you play an RPG, maybe there might be a few quests that are different for different classes, but 90% of the game is still the same either way. (For the record, I'm specifically referring to 21st-century Western countries). The differing experiences between sexes and genders aren't enough to justify revolving your personality or identity around it."
CMV: Low iq people should get mandatory disability benefits,People that are low iq from 70 to 89 should get mandatory disability benefits without getting denied. I have a low iq.

CMV: Hetero Women have just as unrealistic standards of romance as men do,"there have been many discussions and studies done on how men are affected by porn consumption. from sex addiction, to mirroring problematic behaviors, to normalizing aggressive sex. while I think the situation is not completely similar I find it interesting how little I see women examine their biases and expectations when it comes to dating.

there's no problem with preferences of course but when there are increasing concerns of low birth rates, low marriage rates, and young people having less sex than ever I think both sides should be critical about whether what they want is reasonable to expect. I'm sure there are plenty of women who want completely doable things in their relationships but how many women unknowingly are ruining their romantic lives trying to live up to some idealized version of romance that doesn't exist outside of fiction? 

especially when you consider the onus is still primarily on men to engage and push romantic relationships forward it's just exhausting to constantly be trying to gauge what the person sees as romantic or what they want out of a partner when I know the standards are so skewed towards perfect men who are charming, confident, assertive, and masculine in all the right ways while perfectly avoiding any and all red flags that simply come from living in a patriarchy. And of course the women in question are free to ghost and ignore anyone not to their standards, inadvertently making the problem worse as they continually reduce their dating pools looking for a perfect man that doesn't exist. even lesbians have noted how difficult it is to date women for presumably similar reasons.

this is by no means a woman hating post nor is it an excuse for men to be emotionally unintelligent or manipulative but i genuinely feel there's a huge gap in expectations that ruins many relationships. men, do you find this to be true in your circles/relationships? women, do you feel your standards have been unknowingly shifted due to all the romance media we have created? are women aware of how exhausting it is to be a man trying to live up to these ""reasonable"" standards?"

CMV: there is no argument that sufficiently overrides a students rights explaining why a student(in the USA) must recite the pledge of allegiance.,"im going to start by addressing some of the primary arguments for it

1. its to honor people who died for you/ your country.

the students in no way likely compelled or asked said people(soldiers) to die or fight in a war. additionally most wars in modern history fought by the us have not been fought for the sovereignty or preservation of the USA as a country but rather for political gain and posturing. compounding this the student in question(assuming they are a k-11) has no ability to directly change political policy or if a war is fought or not. lastly the person in question could have easily have been born anywhere else and did not willingly decide to be born in a specific country or location.

2. its respectful

it is inherently disrespectful to mandate that a student say any set of words or phrases against their will especially if they are of a different religion and do not agree with the under god part of the pledge of allegiance. to further back this claim the pledge of allegiance is allegedly a symbol of american values/policies like ""freedom and the constitution, given that the constitution contains the first amendment its disrespectful and mocking to the student to utilize such a symbol as a method of depriving said student of the rights said symbol represents.

lastly punishing students for not reciting it is essentially punishing a thought crime."
"CMV: Nurture has a much bigger effect on people than Nature, on all aspects of life.","This has been a topic of interest for a very long time &amp; have been researching it for a while. When I say ""research"" I mean watching documentaries on serial killers upbringing. Listening to neural scientists &amp; psychologists speak about their experience/opinions on this topic and reading articles.

To be clear this topic is heavily debated in psychology/neural science. However it seems that the more modern the studies are, the more it points to environment being the biggest factor. 

Explains why almost every serial killer (if not all) has had a very troubled past. Even ones that people used to believe had a normal upbringing, like Jeffery Dahmer. Turns out after looking into what he claimed was ""normal"", was actually twisted. 

Explains why criminals of all degrees were usually forced into their life due to environmental factors (such as poverty).

Explains why in American style prisons the return rate is 76%, while in Denmark where they have much different prison environments, the return rate overall is only 27% &amp; in open prisons the return rate is 19%. Denmark figured out that if you treat people like humans/give help while in prison &amp; more importantly out of prison. Then those people are much less likely to commit crimes. 

Explains why when there was a case of identical triplets being separated at birth (documentary is called Three Identical Strangers). Even though they were all genetically identical, raised in the same country/state (which is a big deal actually), they all came out very different. I mean people were really trying to force them to seem alike &amp; even then it was clear how different they were personality wise. One of the brothers specifically was so damaged from his past, that he ended up committing suicide. 

Explains why depending on the country you were born in, that your IQ varies. I mean it varies by A LOT, even just a 15 point different in IQ is huge. Yet as it turns out, countries with IQ average above 95 are mostly wealthier nations (compared to the world). While countries that are very poor, rank low in IQ, many in the low 80/mid 70 IQ range &amp; a fair amount in the 60 range. Some countries like Nepal and couple others were in the 40 IQ range. 

Source: https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country/





Please include this specific point when providing a counter argument:

Also something that has to be explained if the belief that genetics plays a bigger role than environment. That something is the IQ gap not only in poorer countries, but minorities in America vs White people. There is a significant IQ gap between the average Black American vs a White American. If the the belief that genetics plays a bigger part than environment. Then by default the explanation for IQ gaps are due to genetics, therefore you would also have to say that minorities are less intelligent than white people genetically. 

With the big racial discrimination implications aside, I find that explanation hard to believe. Because even asian countries like Nepal scored very, very low on IQ tests, as well as African, middle eastern and so on. What those countries &amp; the minorities in America have in common is their wealth (aka environment), not genetics.

Source: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-black-white-test-score-gap-why-it-persists-and-what-can-be-done/amp/

So again, I believe that the environment plays the biggest factor in peoples outcomes, compared to their genetics. However I am always challenging my views &amp; am interested to hear why you may believe the opposite."

CMV: Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election,"I am not a fan of Donald Trump and if I had my way, neither Biden or Trump would be president. 

However, I think Trump has a very good chance of a) securing his party’s nomination and b) winning the general election in ‘24 if he runs against Biden. 

Inflation is at a 40-year high and the feds just announced they will raise interest rates again.  This hurts people who have ARMs and people who are looking to buy a home or borrow money for another large purchase.  Inflation has also taken a huge chunk out of Americans’ paychecks - effectively a pay cut because wages are not increasing at the same rate as prices. It looks like this will continue for the foreseeable future, until we are in a full-blown recession. 

This mirrors the country’s economic problems at the end of the Carter administration. Reagan absolutely stomped Carter in 1980 and Reagan ran largely on “Carter and his party put all of us in the poor house.” If you look at the electoral maps for the 1980 and 1984 elections, damn near the entire country voted for Reagan - even liberal California. 

Nobody else in the Republican Party has the popularity or name recognition that Trump has; it is unlikely that any of the other candidates could beat Trump in the primaries.  It is also highly unlikely that Trump will be indicted. Indicting a former president is something that has never been done before, and the DOJ knows it would only divide the country even more and cause a huge backlash. If anything, an indictment would probably make Trump more popular. And it would not disqualify him from running. 

I would like to think I am wrong and the GOP will run a more sane candidate, but I am not hopeful.  What am I missing?"

cmv: neoclassical economics should be discarded as a field,"Neoclassical economics (econ) purports to describe how people make decisions around allocation of resources. But in both lab and real world settings it has been proven that it does not. It is therefore a broken field of inquiry, pseudo science, and should cease to be taught or researched. 

In the lab:

- copious behavioural research has demonstrated that people do not think or make decisions the way econ thinks they should. Moreover people do not behave 'as if' they were econs - the outcomes of their decisions are different.

In reality: 

- in my own field of environmental and climate economics, neoclassical assumptions have been profoundly damaging. They consistently suggest absurd decarbonisation pathways that rely on rates of land use change 3x faster than any observed in history. Such transitions are not only implausible, they are highly undesirable. The rapid pace of soybean uptake, e.g., has led led widespread spillover deforestation in the amazon. Econ denies such problems by assuming perfect policy oversight and an absence of counterproductive decisions. 

- more absurdly still, econ suggests 4degrees of warming is compatible with a growing economy, and indeed is the optimal tradeoff between costs of decarbonisation and climate damages. 4degrees of warming is borderline incompatible present day human societies. 

Therefore, neoclassical economics is not only false, but profoundly damaging, making absurd and unworkable policy recommendations in important areas of work.

It should no longer be taught or researched."

CMV: A “National Divorce” would be beneficial for the United States.,"If you haven’t heard, MTG called for what she calls a “National Divorce”. Basically this would separate the red states and blue states.

While I do agree that this is part of one of MTG’s unhinged rants, I don’t think it’s a terrible idea if the US wants to improve its reputation abroad.

Many of the Americans that foreigners mock the US for come from the red states, and many of the ideas that are not aligned with those of developed nations are within the south as well, aka where the true Republican States are.

It’s true that a lot of the Western States are red too. But those states don’t hold the attitudes from diehard Republicans in the south because those from the Rockies States are moreso Libertarian.
And yes the northern Rockies do lean more right than the southern Rockies, but they are nonetheless Libertarian. (eg. Most Wyomingites don’t have a high opinion of LGBT people but do not support laws meant to discriminate against them).

The way I see it, if the US is a garden, recently it’s been infested by weeds. And a “National Divorce” is exactly what the US needs to “weed the garden”, because day by day, the problem of the weeds get worse, and the only way to get rid of the weeds is to take out the infested parts of the garden.

And maybe, the rest of the world will see that many of the attitudes that they associate with Americans are only supported by some, rather than many believing that all Americans hold such an attitude.
(eg. perhaps Europeans will no longer think twice before visiting the US out of fear they will be shot on sight)"

CMV: Morality is overrated,"First, I will clarify that everyone ought to have certain baseline levels of morality. Obviously, you should treat people with respect, don't do anything that directly harms anyone, and generally be courteous and mindful of other people. 

What I am talking about is more superficial things that people use to moral grandstand. Things like not consuming certain products for ethical reasons. Being self-righteous about certain political views and antagonizing anyone who disagrees with you. Being on a high horse about your religion. Flexing about how your career choice is noble or virtuous. Letting everyone know about your volunteer work or donating to charity. I'm sorry, but being self-righteous about these types of things is one of the most obnoxious traits someone can have.

Life is short. There is nothing wrong with only worrying about anyone other than yourself, your family, and your friends. Oh, the dairy industry is bad for the environment, and animals are mistreated? So what, burgers taste good. The IP creator of this video game has socially unacceptable opinions? Who cares? The game is fun. Your friend said some ignorant stuff while drunk? Who cares? They are fun to hang out with. There's a new protest about the new flavor of the month issue? Don't care, I'd rather just watch Netflix with my partner. New volunteer opportunities available? Don't care, I'm too lazy. Career choice contributes little to society and exploits workers? Whatever, the pay is good. Did a new charity just open up? Oh well, I'm gonna spend my money on fun stuff instead. 

The point is that there is nothing wrong with just living your life, doing stuff you enjoy, and not caring so much about trying to help fix society. If you want to be a progressive political activist who volunteers during your free time while avoiding unethical products, that's fine. You do you. But that's not going to win you any brownie points, especially if you are flexing about it all the time. It's also not a valid excuse to be judgmental or aggressive to people who disagree with you or are more on the apathetic side. Just live and let live."

CMV: Pee is stored in the balls.,"Pee is stored in the balls because of the intricate network of tubes that connect the urinary tract to the testicles. These tubes, known as the ""Pee Ducts"", are responsible for transporting urine from the bladder to the testicles, where it is stored until it is ready to be expelled.

The testicles themselves play a crucial role in the process of urine storage. As the urine flows into the testicles, it is filtered and purified by the testicular tissue. This process removes impurities and ensures that the urine is of the highest possible quality.

Once the urine has been purified, it is stored in the testicles until the body is ready to expel it. At this point, the urine is expelled from the testicles and flows through the Pee Ducts back to the bladder, where it can be eliminated from the body.

While this may seem like an unusual process, it is actually quite common in the animal kingdom. Many animals, including dogs, cats, and horses, store urine in similar ways. The human body has simply evolved to adapt to this natural process over time.

In conclusion, pee is stored in the balls due to the intricate network of Pee Ducts and the crucial role that the testicles play in the purification and storage of urine. While this may seem strange, it is a natural process that has been observed in many other animals as well."

"CMV: Right to die should be available across the US, not just to terminal illnesses but uncurable conditions as well","the biggest obstacle has been religion which has dominated the narrative, pushing agendas such as sanctity of life, yet ironically one of the tenants of Christianity is preparation for the next life in regard to heaven or hell.

For those of us who struggle with conditions that significantly impair our ability to enjoy life this ideal can make life seem more like a prison. As someone who has struggled against mental disorders since the beginning this view comes to mind. Theres no cure for certain conditions such as schizophrenia once the damage has set in, and even if you do narrow it out the damage can be too much

doctors object to this in thinking that wanting to die means you are mentally unwell and are not of sound judgement, while this may be true im some cases, most solutions provided may not be enough to solve ones own desire.

If the U.S. would go this route, suicide counts would plummet, because having the option to die in front of you rather than forcing yourself into a painful ""escape"". it may not prevent some, but who commit suicide are looking to take control of something and having it within a reasonable grasp would be enough to deter some.

im not advocating for a culture of ""kill your self if its too much"", rather an acceptance that ones life and their decisions are of their own, that having the option there can be freeing for those struggling with this pain."
CMV: High to severe forms of ASD and other neurological disorders should be purged via eugenics if possible,"Yeah, title says it all and I'm sorry. I'll explain what prompted me to make this.

[INCIDENT BELOW, SKIP IF YOU DONT CARE]

I was recently on a 6 hour bus ride and I sat next to a man who seemed to have some neurological disorder, probably a severe ASD. Before the bus even takes off, he grows anxious and asks if there is an outlet on the bus for his phone, I say no there is not. He anxiously yells: ""Excuse me, is there an outlet on this bus."" ""I need to know if there is an outlet in this bus"" multiple times until the driver says no.

(Might I add that during the entire ride, he would periodically have strange conversations with himself? He even played an episode of some show on full volume and replayed the same section five times.)

Anyways, about an hour in, he asks me if we are going to stop at a restaurant because he is hungry. I say: ""I can't promise you anything, but on these bus rides, we usually stop at a small gas station for snacks."" He starts again with his yelling: ""DOES ANYONE HAVE SNACK FOR ME, I NEED FOOD OR IM GONNA STARVE! I NEED A RESTAURANT RIGHT NOW! HOW DO NONE OF YOU HAVE FOOD FOR ME!""

I could not believe that I was sitting next to a legal adult. Continuing, another hour later, I have to turn my phone's flashlight on for literally a second. He responds by turning on the bus's interior booth light and grins at me and saying: ""This is what you wanted."" I say: ""Please can you turn off the light?"" ""I thought you wanted it."" he says. 

I turn it off myself, he turns it back on. I leave to the bathroom to get away from him. Twenty minutes later, I returned and when he saw me, he turned the lights back on.

More time passes, he threatens me, saying ""I can't punch a guy with glasses."" I tell him: ""Why would you do that?"" ""It's just a joke"" says he. Then, he started leaning on me, I shove him off aggressively, he puts his arm around me, I yank it off. Continues this a few more times and then I leave to the bathroom for another twenty minutes. When I comeback, he slowly tries to lean on me AGAIN. I tell him: ""get off of me motherfucker, I'm not telling you again."" 

More time later, ""Why can't I lean in you."" ""Listen motherfucker,"" I say ""last chance, do not touch me or I'll have you kicked off this bus.""

[END OF INCIDENT]

I honestly believe that both the haver and the people around him suffer from his disorder.

From his perspective:

1. He is too anxious for which the situation demands. He suffers from extreme anxiety even for small things (like not having an outlet.)

2. Because of his strange and antisocial behavior, he will struggle to make friends.

3. He mentally processes the world and his surroundings in a less sophisticated way.

From my and others perspective:

1. We were made extremely uncomfortable from his tantrums.

2. I was basically threatened.

3. I was basically sexually assaulted multiple times.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLDR/Reasoning:
I do not believe him and people like him can be rehabilitated; I'm sure it is extremely hard to work with people like him and that it's mostly an unchangeable aspect of his personality and genetic.

So why shouldn't we try to eradicate these disorders? Those who have them often suffer from extreme anxiety, have trouble socializing, see the world in a less developed way. Those who interact with them will take on a lot of stress, and possibly be sexually assaulted, harassed, threatened, or assaulted. This has been talked about before on reddit several times. There was a thread about a woman's severely autistic brother who would masturbate to her and be inappropriate to her sexually. They don't understand why it's wrong, they cannot be fixed.

For people here with autism, I am only really talking about severe cases of ASD. I understand that one's autism can be a significant part of their personality, but if we get rid of it in the future, that will no longer be possible."

Think about it like this, while it's nice to see white men in there 30s heavily concerned about the race of a mermaids in a children's movie. Growing up, it's always this:

White man saves the day, is the hero, is the main character. 

White female is the princess, the main character, sometimes hero, center of attention, is the main character. 

But we hardly see much positive representation of people of color, only recently changes have been made, but with a lot of push back. 

Black men? Often times portrayed as male thugs, gangsters, needing a white savior, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Black women portrayed loud and obnoxious.

Asian men? Weak, feminine, thugs, or smart but expendable resources, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Asian women are made to hate the Asian men and worship a white man, while hating and denouncing Asian heritage and culture.

These things propagate into our real world through in a sense manipulation and have extremely negative consequences. 

So I'm happy for this movement for better representation. Is it perfect? Nope. But I'm optimistic and think our kids will have a bettee time with more relateable and positive role models through the media."
CMV: Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts should be promptly removed from in-class duties,"Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding through their shirt should be promptly removed from in-class duties.

Such behaviour is a form of sexual harassment of children who are not free to leave the person doing this, and who are not free to complain about the behaviour without a risk of reprisal from an individual in a position of authority.

Working in a workshop while wearing gag breasts poses a risk of an accident which may injure the teacher or possibly someone else. While some may not care if the teacher injured themself, part of OHS is forbidding workers from working in an unsafe manner.

Persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding is disrespectful to students and other teachers, and is disruptive to a school being a place of learning and personal development. It also promotes disrespect towards women when schools should promote respect for diverse groups of people. (If you’re female and you don’t feel offended, that’s fine, but that doesn’t mean others aren’t offended)

If the teacher claims that the breasts are real, the teacher, possibly during paid work time and paid by the employer, should have a doctor certifying that the breasts are real.

If the teacher is wearing gag breasts because of a mental issue which is not their fault, then they should be removed from in-class duties until their issue has resolved.

If they can’t remove the teacher because of a teacher shortage or restrictions on disciplining teachers, fix the shortage or labour regulations.

Schools should forbid inappropriate clothing for teachers and other staff, not just students.

The school should not wait several months to act, or only act when international media gathered evidence that it was a charade. It should try to avoid punishing students for photographing the teacher - only doing so if it’s to prevent a lawsuit against the school or if the photography is disruptive or endorsing the teacher’s inappropriate behaviour.

It should go without saying, but I’m using “they” because it’s about a hypothetical teacher who may be male or may be female, not because I’m asserting that the teacher is non-binary. And my view is about the school’s handling of the teacher, rather than about the teacher themself.

CMV: Taxpayer dollars should not be used to bail out Silicon Valley Bank’s depositors.,"If you don’t know, the largest bank for tech companies and venture capitalists, Silicon Valley Bank, just went under. Many of these VCs are calling for the government to step up and pay depositors back their money beyond the insured FDIC $250K.

I don’t think taxpayers should be forced to bankroll rich, Silicon Valley executives, most of which are tech bro white men from rich families and networks who could easily make up the funds lost privately.

I’m a founder of a tech startup. I have raised money from investors. I have learned the ins and outs of my industry and have lots of fellow VC-backed founder friends. 

But I don’t think the general taxpayer should be responsible to pay back private deposits that were lost due to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank’s management and the VCs who caused the bank run that led to its demise. If it were me, I’d figure out a way to operate within the insured amount of funds or put my money in various banks for more security. 

The same VC investors who are so gung-ho about capitalism and have no qualms about screwing the poor and middle classes for their own wealth are now expecting the government, and the general population, to bail them out of something they brought upon themselves.

Yes, some of these startups will have to shut down as a result. But being an entrepreneur is about being able to be scrappy, manage resources effectively, and operate in times of uncertainty. Those that fail due to this SVB situation probably were not using the capital efficiently anyway (maybe that private jet and those fancy dinners weren’t the best use of funds, eh?). 

Startups fail all the time because of forces out of their control. This is no different and it shouldn’t be taxpayers’ problem.

Religions have a lot of psychological insight and beauty in their traditions. Yeah, there is a lot of ugliness too, but it is a fundamental part of the human experience. I think it is more valuable than literature even."
CMV: The Federal government should not handle social issues,"I'm not taking any stance on any particular social issue for this argument, but it is my belief is that things would be much better and much less divided if the federal government handled only economic,  and defense issues, among others and not social ones (such as lgbtq+ issues and race based issues). This does not mean they should ignore discrimination against a particular class, but their role should stop at ensuring that the government treats all INDIVIDUALS equally, rather than trying to effect things like trans people in sports and rates of employment for particular classes of people, for example.

I'll make two arguments for why I believe this: 

1) The Federal Gov can only do so much, and has it's hands full already without taking on complex issues of race and identity politics. We would have better outcomes in the non-social areas if the political discussion and elections at the national level avoided focusing on social issues.

and

2) Social Change happens much better and faster if it starts locally and then moves to state level, with any federal legislation being done only after the issue has been worked out at the more local levels

I will use gay marriage vs trans sports inclusion as examples: 

Imagine if in the 90s the congress had passed a law mandating states accept gay marriage. There was much less public support at the time, so this would have cause states to rebel and challenge this with state laws and supreme court challenges, and had it been forced through it likely would have led to a more conservative congress and president being elected in the following cycle, who would then overturn the legislation and possibly pass legislation banning gay marriage that would then be harder to overturn. The way it happened was a much better outcome than this (I am of the opinion that allowing gay marriage is absolutely the right thing to do, as treating gay people differently than straight people is unconstitutional and wrong, but this is just an example for the purpose of this post), and by waiting to pass federal legislation protecting gay marriage until after the public opinion was swayed, we got to a better outcome quicker with less change of it being reversed.

The trans rights issue is a counter example, where the Biden admin mandated that trans athletes be allowed to compete as the gender they identify within high school sports. (I am not taking a position on whether this is the right or wrong policy, it is a complex issue but it is beyond the scope of this post).

We are now seeing backlash against this and other trans issues, and ultimately it seems the pushback is favoring the opposition in popular opinion.

I believe that this approach will lead to a result that is counter to the result that those who believe it is the right thing would want, ie more backlash and more power going to politicians that oppose the rights that those in favor are pushing for.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I think forcing social change at the federal level is counter-productive to the goals of said social change, and it also distracts the public, allowing special interests to essentially sneak by other legislation that very few want that hurts everyone (except the very few who want the legislation)."

CMV: There's something off about transgenderness.,"Hopefully this doesn't break any rules; I need help. I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want to make people who know me hate me over this. I'd like to preface by saying I consider myself to not be right-wing, nor do I think I lean right at all; I'm not conservative. I'm also horrible with words, so I hope I'm able to have the intended meaning of my words come across properly.

I don't think trans people are evil, that they should be punished or that they should have mean words thrown at them; this is not what this is about.

For some reason, I get this visceral reaction when seeing that someone's trans online or irl; I just grimace internally and am like ""It's probably not a good idea to interact too deeply with this person."" While this isn't the case for other LGBT people or most leftists, it is the case with radical feminists or people you'd see at FDS. When I see a comment like ""kill all men"" or ""all cis people stink"", I grimace internally and think to myself it's probably a bad idea to interact too deeply with this individual. ...The same goes for trans people; I've got a few trans acquaintances, and sometimes it's like they're all the same person. I'm not sure if this is some actual pattern recognition or just confirmation bias, but I swear I can sometimes actually predict what their thoughts on random stuff like music will be. I don't think I've met a single transgender person that wasn't autistic or had some other sort of mental disorder either.

This is all based on personal experience and I've got no studies to back my thoughts up other than that one time where I read somewhere that said transgender people are five times more likely to be on the spectrum. ...But there's a clear pattern here. I see conservatives sometimes make similar claims that there's a clear correlation between being transgender and having mental issues... but people just dismiss them as being lunatics, like they're intentionally trying to distort the original person's claim.

I'm not saying they should be forced to detransition or whatever, nor do I think they're actual menaces to society or something, but just like it's \*weird\* to walk on all fours around the mall, it's \*weird\* to buy into all the rhetoric, partake into cancel culture, have pronouns in bio, all that stuff. Like, I get it: gender roles suck. I actually wish I were born a woman myself 'cause it'd affect how people treat me and shit. But I wasn't; I'm not, and I frankly think it's a bit, well, grimace-inducing to think you've become a woman or a man or some new sort of individual just because you decided to start/stop wearing makeup or dress like a 70-year-old grandpa. I once read a story about a happily married straight couple that was perfectly average until one of them realized she was a lesbian and the other one that she was a woman. And then they're happily married lesbians. ...And to me that makes no sense! Sexuality isn't a switch you can flip! People don't become hot just because they claim to be something different than you thought they were, now do they??

Help me out please. I didn't think too much when writing this and there's probably a lot I've expressed badly or left unsaid or something (don't take me trying to explain it better in comments as me changing my view). Feel free to ask clarifying questions I guess? I don't want to be this judgmental transphobic individual, but I can't help but see the patterns! I feel like thinking that there's nothing wrong and that they're all fine, dandy and mentally healthy is just me lying to myself."
CMV: most pollution enthusiasts can't logically reason why the transition to EVs is bad,"There are the typical arguments like the long tailpipe theory, which there is validity to, but can easily be defeated. Coal power stations concentrate pollution in certain areas instead of spreading it around like ICE cars. Then there's mining, which yes, is valid as well, but 95% of lithium batteries are recyclable multiple times. Even before being crushed, can be used in second life applications like large scale energy storage. A pound of lithium goes further than a barrel of oil. Some even go as far as saying they love the sound of ICE vehicles, which is very silly to me. If someone loves the smell of rotting garbage, is that a logical excuse to not clean it up?

It's with these facts and questions in mind that I posit that a lot of pollution enthusiasts who are against electrification have no solid ground to stand on.

I know there are a lot of pollution enthusiasts who have reasons and I'd like to hear them and hopefully I can have my mind changed."
CMV: There is nothing wrong with video games having an easy mode or people wanting one.,"I’ve always been perplexed when people get upset at the addition of (or someone saying they’d want an addition of) an easy mode to games that they enjoy.

I’m someone who enjoys modes and will use a variety of modes depending on the mood I’m in/ how much time I have. If it’s a genre I’m familiar with and I feel like I challenge I would choose “hard.” If I’m not as into the gameplay for a game and just want to enjoy the story I’d have no problem choosing “easy.” For times where I’m feeling somewhere in-between I’ll choose normal.

I really enjoy the flexibility different difficulty modes in video games but see pushback against difficulty modes a lot so I wanted to see others perspectives.

I understand that some people always want a challenge, but I’m not sure how it affects their gameplay to simply choose “hard” and let others do as they wish. 

Different modes and more decisions with how gameplay works also helps people with disabilities that might make video games more challenging. 

All and all I’d like to understand the criticism and know if there’s something I’m overlooking."
cmv: shaving cause rapid/thicker hair growth,"Hello im bad grammar kid 
Anyways 
I seriously think shaving makes hair grow faster in certain area's (not the head)  a lot of people say as soon as they started shaving it grows faster or thicker even with me the side i shaved looks different from the side i didn't shave. I asked quite a few people some answers i got from the women
"" i didn't shave for years, it was small it wasn't as noticeable but once they started shaving it got noticeable at a very face pace""  I know people like to say oh maybe it's the age or maybe it's just the way it looks !!!  Or how how about you shave your head to see if it grows faster or your facial hair. Lets talk about the facial part when i started shaving it rapidly started growing faster and thicker then it stop at some point though. It just a big coincidence that as soon as started shaving it made major changes but right before that no major changes at all. 
Its just way too many coincidence about shaving that everyone feels this way and that is just a myth and people personal experiences. Someone told me a story that they had Google this before and they made a big mistake by listening to Google shaved anyway and had to seek laser treatment for this. She said for years she wasn't hairy but within just 1 year after shaving a mustache it grew way thicker in noticeable.
I ask her ""well why did you feel the need to shave in the first place?"" She said it was just a few little hairs that wasn't really noticeable to the public but thought no big deal if she shaved."
"CMV: North Korea is actually a far right ethno-fascist state under the guise of Stalinist-Communism, not an actual Communist state."," 

Just what  is North Korea, exactly? Outsiders have been trying to figure out for many decades just what their deal is. How does the Kim regime and military elites want their own people to view about themselves and the world, and how do they want the outside world to view them? Their actions don't seem to match their records, and their records don't seem to match their actions, either. It's quite bizarre, even to South Koreans.

Before I take on these questions based on my aforementioned view in the post's title, I would like to give some background information as to how I got to making this post in the first place and why I think this sort of discussion is desperately needed. I am myself quite the history buff and geek ever since my high school years, even though I am not and never was a History major in university. I just have an innate desire to make sense of the world. There's a saying that learning an unbiased and objective history of humankind in all sorts of distant kingdoms, empires, and hegemonic states/republics can help you understand and help you prescribe solutions for the the world in present times. Well, as someone of East Asian descent I just wanted to make sense of the crazy tensions between the 3 great powers of the Asian sphere: the Korean peninsula, China, and Japan. I especially wanted to know why Korea is the way it is now, and how it got to be, tragically, divided in half(much like a caged tiger), for many decades; and just why no one, even South Koreans themselves, seems to really understand the Kim regime and its people. It's kinda like how when you see your neighbor next door trying to arm themselves to the teeth and installing all these military grade security systems in their house in a completely safe neighborhood. The first thing that comes to mind would not be how I should stop this guy from being a nut. It would instead be on ""how this guy thinks."" The same applies for such an isolated country like North Korea. Knowing this can help the world leaders in South Korea and the United States on how to best reunify the country with the least amount of misery and death.

Anyways, back to the main point of this post. Now, I share the perspective that Korea is actually a hereditary, far right national socialist state with Korean characteristics/traditions. However, I just want to provide an overview of the few school of thoughts out there, with regard to what North Korea actually is, and there are 5 to be exact:

1.) The traditional conservative view is that North Korea is just merely a Stalinist-Communist holdover from the Soviet era. I understand why a lot of casual viewers of mass media may fall into this perspective, because the whole North Korean propaganda schtick with the red and sickle symbolisms, and left-wing style rhetoric like ""Democratic People's Republic"" and ""the masses"" really does make it seem North Korea is like a Stalinist-Communist regime. Actually, many South Koreans who are just casual watchers of their own mass media(KBS, Yonhap News, SBS, etc.) tend to hold this view.

2.) The neoliberal/neoconservative view is that North Korea is a state that has just degraded into a rogue state trying to one day, in their minds, proliferate their nuclear arsenal to the point where they can gain the upper hand over the United States, in order to gain the sovereignty that they desire. The communist style propaganda, the massive military parades, and the like are just a means to an end, in order to shore up support from North Korean citizens over its Songun ""Military first"" policies needed to build more nukes.

3.)The leftist and liberal view is that North Korea is simply just a continuation of Confucian dynastic traditions from way before Japanese occupation, and that it is neither Communist nor Fascist. Their rationale is that all they ever wanted was to be left alone, and that had the United States not carpet-bombed the hell out of the northern part of the peninsula, then the Kim regime might have took a milder form of dictatorship, akin to post-70s North Vietnam's or East Germany's. This may seem like the most logical explanation, but there is a major flaw to this line of thinking, which I will get to after this overview.

4.)The permanent bunker Fascist state view(My View): Not long ago, I have stumbled upon and read B.R Myers' ""The Cleanest Race"" on North Korea actually being an Imperial Japanese fascist holdover from the 30s and 40s. Now, B.R Myers seems to have no leanings in the academic world of Korean history and literature. He just simply told it like it was, in terms of the order of events starting from the Japanese annexation of Korea. His rationale was this: The Japanese Imperial government stationed in Korea at the time deliberately brewed up race-based Korean nationalism, in order to establish a kinship between Koreans and the Japanese. Ironically enough, a lot of the intellectuals that helped out with Kim Il Sung's propaganda machine were actually pro-Japanese collaborators who decided to then turn this pro-Japanese Korean nationalism into a purely Korean version. Much of the iconography meant to glorify the Kim family was actually based on Japan's own propaganda of venerating Emperor Hirohito. Yes, I am not making this shit up. After reading this really groundbreaking and impartial analysis of North Korea, I've had severe cognitive dissonance(for a few days) as someone who is actually of Korean descent. The hard hitting and cold truth is that many literate middle and upper class Koreans at the time all felt this collective shame for supporting Imperial Japan upon their defeat in WW2, so they all felt like they wanted to settle the score, save face, and feel better about themselves as proud Koreans. Out of the 5 perspectives, I would say this holds the most weight and validity, due to B.R Myers' intensive research on what ""actually happened"" all those decades ago from Korea's liberation to the start of the Korean War. As a Korean, I am very much aware that Korean history researched by Korean academics themselves tend to muddy the waters and to steep itself in nationalism. His approach was a way of cutting through all the noise, and focus purely on the truth of the chronology of events that had occurred in the peninsula. It was certainly quite the plot twist in terms of truly changing what we already had believed to be true about North Korea. It's quite fitting, because Korean thrillers and mysteries are also filled with plot twists and irony.

5.) Finally, the bleakest of all perspectives is that North Korea is just a straight up hypocritical racketeering mafia state bent on its own survival. This perspective is mainly held by independent journalists of various political stripes that mainly try to expose corruption in a lot of 3rd world countries(kleptocracies, oligarchies, and the like). All the propaganda the state is trying to spew to the public and to the outside world are merely political manipulations designed to cover up for the corruption of its military elites. Much like the 2nd perspective in that it is a rogue state trying to survive, only this time it manipulates geopolitics in a way that serves their own monetary interests in underground industries. If this is to be true, then this is truly a bleak scenario in which the Kim regime and its military elites are guaranteed its longevity unless it is overtaken violently by inside or outside forces.

...

Now, with all that out of the way, I just want to offer my counter arguments to all of them and to offer further supporting arguments to the 4th view(my view):

1.) Contrary to popular belief, Kim Il Sung was not socialist in the Marxist-Leninist sense. In fact, he wasn't really educated or literate about Marxist-Leninist intellectualism himself. He dropped out of school entirely when he was 16 or 17, in order to involve himself in resistance movements against the Japanese. It wasn't until he was picked by the Soviets to lead the Northern half, after making a name for himself as a guerilla fighter against Japan. He had only implemented the red iconography and leftist style propaganda, in order to provide cover for himself so that his administration can start nation building without the Soviets butting in. The real purpose of his propaganda was purely for fascist, race-based reasons, which I will get into later when I get to B.R Myers' perspective.

2.) It's not necessarily true that North Korea seeks power or hegemony over United States, or that it has the intention of using the nuclear weapons. The Kim regime, unpredictable and irrational as they seem, will not actually use a nuke themselves; because it knows it would spell the end for their regime if they do.

3.) Yes, it is true that Kim Jong Un is a rational actor. He does, indeed, care about the survival of his regime. It's also true that North Koreans do want their sovereignty and they do want to be left alone. However, it is not a Confucian state or a continuation of previous Korean kingdoms, by any means. The fascist style propaganda and iconography of the Kim family intended to portray motherly figures, not fatherly figures, which is the basis for an Confucian based authoritarian state. They are shown to be these really feminine caretaker figures. If paintings showing men around the same age laying their heads on Kim's bosom for comfort and warmth, then I don't know what is a more motherly undertone than that. If that wasn't prove enough, just look at how dozens and dozens of young kids in uniforms rush to feel his embrace every time he goes up to a podium to commence a massive speech.

4.) Now, onto my view. To reiterate from my overview of this perspective, pro-Japanese collaborators were hired by none other than Kim Il Sung himself to create his propaganda machine for him. Koreans, during the Japanese annexation, were actually incentivized to be proud of their own Korean race, in order for the Imperial government to establish a kinship between Koreans and Japanese. A lot of the literate middle and upper class Koreans felt this collective shame for supporting Japan upon their defeat in WW2, so they would often entrench themselves in these intellectual enclaves to create their own unique forms of pure Korean ethno-nationalism, thereby kicking the Japanese out of it. Much of modern day North Korean propaganda comprises of dehumanizing Western adversaries, mainly United States, as these big nosed tainted people conspiring to taint their brethren in the South and to ultimately their own homeland and racial stock. This strongly resembles a lot of the iconography depicted in Nazi German propaganda whereas they depicted Jews as scheming individuals out to taint the German race, traditions. and sovereignty. The difference between North Korean fascism and German fascism is that Korean fascism is more of an inward kind, whereas German fascism was expansionist(e.g.. Lebensraum). The Kim family's version of ethno-fascism is one where because the Korean race is too pure, it had been bullied for its kindness and innocence. Therefore, Koreans need a motherly figure to look out for them. By the way, if anyone is arguing that the Kims are considered as fatherly leaders/generals, they are not. In fact, it's actually a mistranslation of a lot of Western documentaries. The word "" 어머 "" means mother or relating to motherly characteristics.

5.) Now, I don't entirely discredit the mafia state theory; but I do think money is needed anyway to fund their nuclear operations and to just simply feed themselves. By ""they"", I mean a lot of the military elites. I think that their dealings with underground industries are just a means to an end, in order to legitimize their fascist state. The reason why I say ""out of necessity"" is that they lost much of the aid and revenue after the fall of the Soviet empire in the early 90s. They simply are just broke as hell, and need to find ways to fund their state, even if it resorts to dealing with the criminal world. By and large, I don't think that these dealings are truly corrupting military elites(maybe some). If this racketeering corruption theory were really true, then why didn't the Kim regime just collapse during the Great famines in the 90s? Surely, the military elites and common class soldiers would have to put a bullet on them in rebellion out of desperation for better material well being. Plus, a kleptocratic mafia state implies a materialist mindset, which fascism uses does not subscribe to. The difference between fascism and communism is really this. Communism offers improvements in material well being for the ""masses."" Fascism just straight up offers struggle and strive in both good and bad times, in order to strength the sovereignty and purity of their state and race, respectively.

I am curious as to what my fellow Redittors think is the most accurate perspective on North Korea, and why the ""bunker Fascist state"" theory would be wrong."
CMV: No objective prescriptive statement or objective moral framework is supported by reality.,"Status: no change
I believe no objective moral framework exists, and only subjective meaning exists.

Following the previous conclusion, I also believe objective prescriptive statements do not exist. By this, I mean any statement like: “if you want to have blue hair, you SHOULD dye your hair blue.” Although this statement is logical, I believe the objective “should” is never justified. This chain of logic obviously feels very unintuitive to me, but considering that I believe there is no objective meaning or actions that should be taken It seems only logical that prescriptive statements are always subjective.

To this end, I will make several claims for two cases.

If a god does not exist:
1. An objective moral framework does not exist
2. All meaning is subjective 
3. All prescriptive staments are subjective 

If an all-knowing god exists:
1. No noncircular explanation for an objective moral framework exists
2. No non-circular explanation for the existence of meaning exists
3.No non-circular explanation for the existence of objective prescriptive statements exists.

An example of a circular argument would be: an all-knowing god exists, it knows killing people is wrong, and therefore it is objectively immoral to kill people. You must prove how the conclusion can be reached by a method other than knowing it is true. 

*Additional standards I will hold myself to on CMV.*

If a comment causes me to change anything about any claim I made, that will award a delta, but if I simply need to modify the logic used to reach my conclusions, my mind hasn’t been changed.

To that end, I will try to reply to as many comments as I can. Additionally, all my responses will be the first of these categories that occur and state the category.
1. A clarification 
2. That I have already addressed a similar argument 
3. It changed my mind
4. That their argument seems convincing, but more information is needed to change my mind
5. Addressing why I believe there to be a specific logical or factual inaccuracy in the comment
6. That I don’t believe the initial assumptions needed to make their claim
7. Why their claim is contested information (information that experts reasonably disagree on or are unsure about the conclusion) 

*reasons for wanting view changed*
Universally: although it isn’t my only aim in life, one of the things I want to peruse is finding truth and holding informed opinions. While I do consider my viewpoints I am far from infallible and even some of my most well reaserched or thought out opinions might be false. Whenever I learn new information that changes my mind this marks an improvement in the truth of my opinions and beliefs.
Post specific: not believing in prescriptive statements feels like cognitive dissonance or something. It’s kinda exhausting whenever I think about it."
CMV: STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice.,"STAR voting is a voting system where you give as many candidates as you want a 0-5 rating.  Then,  there's a stimulated runoff between the two candidates with the highest average ratings.  The candidate who is higher ranked on more ballots is the winner.

For example, if you give Alice a rating of 5 and Bob a rating of 4, you count as a vote for Alice in a runoff between Alice and Bob.   If you gave them both a 5, you'd count as an obstention.

This is a useful deterrent to certain kinds of strategic voting.  For example, suppose you're voting in a presidential election, and you're trying to maximize the chance of Bernie Sanders winning.  Naively, the way to do that is to give Bernie Sanders a 5 and everyone else a 0.  However,  the problem with that is if the runoff is actually between Elizabeth Warren and Trump, you've abstained even though you presumably prefer Warren to Trump.  Likewise if the runoff is between Warren and Biden,  Biden and Kasich or Kasich and Trump.  If you want your vote to count in the runoff, voting honestly is a far superior strategy than bullet voting. 

Instant runoff voting is a voting system where voters list their first, second, third, etc choices.  Then, if there's not a candidate with an absolute majority of the remaining votes, you eliminate the candidate with the lowest vote total and reallocate the votes to their next *remaining* preference.

In IRV, your second place selection gets no support from you until your first place is eliminated, assuming your second place wasn't eliminated first.  This means that compromise candidates with a lot of second place support could easily be eliminated early, and that election order is very important.

Instant runoff has some really weird edge cases because elimination order is very important to the results.  For example, in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, the Progressive candidate won.   However, Republicans could have caused the Progressive candidate to lose by having the right number of Republicans put the Progressive as their top choice, or by staying home.

IRV makes it so 

[Ka Ping Yee has an interesting voting system visualizion, coloring in a 2d political compass by the color of the candidate who would win if the center of public opinion is within that area.](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/)  Most systems produce sensible diagrams, but IRV produces the oddest looking diagrams, with shapes that make no sense.  STAR isn't on there, but it shouldn't look too much different from approval. 

[An important way to look at voting systems is 'Voter Satisfaction Efficiency'](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic), a measure of how happy people are with the results.  IRV is slightly better than plurality, but significantly worse than approval voting, STAR or 3-2-1."
CMV: Religion was created by humans to make sense of the unknown and unexplainable,"I admit I haven't delved deeply into the Bible, but I question the reasoning behind the spread of Christianity. Why didn't God send divine messengers like Jesus to other societies and cultures, especially given the diverse religious beliefs and practices across different cultures? The coexistence of different religions has led me to wonder whether Christianity is a human invention.

Why did God choose to establish a foothold in Israel instead of China or Japan? 

As far as I understand, religion was one of the earliest means by which societies came together as communities to achieve common goals. It served as a way to facilitate community growth and development.

I wonder if there were highly intelligent individuals who recognized the potential of religion as a tool for community development and capitalized on it to bring people together in the past."
CMV: Most feminist groups only care about men's problems if they affect women,"Tl;dr: Mainstream groups that aim for gender equality are useless at addressing issues that mostly affect men because they only really care about women.

Usually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women (e.g. college enrollment rates, suicide, homelessness, loneliness) and say that efforts should be made to address them, the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups. I'd argue that feminist groups shouldn't be left to solve them.

It seems to me that **most** feminist groups only care about men's issues if they affect women. Recently I saw [this article linked](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/) and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely. The article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated. That these men are miserable is an afterthought.

Similarly, boys who start to be exposed to Andrew Tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women. Incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that they're lonely and miserable is ignored. Usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students, it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that they're more likely to struggle with student debt.

It seems that if men would only be miserable, lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women, these groups would be perfectly happy so I don't trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected."

CMV: People who cause physical harm to nazis for their political beliefs are no better than nazis,"I’m talking purely about their political beliefs, if they decide to go further and I act violence towards other then it’s a different conversations.

Currently there is not a meaningful amount of power towards white supremacists, nazis, white identitarians or white nationalists. Currently all they can do is speak. Freedom of speech and diversity of thought is one of the most important aspects of a functioning democracy. When people begin to physically assault others for their beliefs it is a sign of a movement towards authoritarianism.

This is because violence towards people who have any differing opinions is only dependent on the common idea and can be turned in any direction if enough people agree. 

Ex. If I think that transgenderism is wrong and immoral and as dangerous as fascism and I have people that support me and we assault people who support transgenderism how are we any different than people who assault nazis?

We’re not as it’s just about beliefs and if we decide to say it’s okay to assault people of x belief it opens up the door to assaulting people of any belief just because you disagree with them."

   next, is my problem with the first argument they throw up , is that we are whiny and no ones entitled to sex and you have to earn that. bullshit, my whole life ive watched gay men and straight women literally throw themselves at men who are complete trash, not because they were respectable or they earned it but becuase they were cute or had a certain status so dont give me that, those guys didnt do anything special to get laid, people are just shallow. why cant people just admit it.

  i literally had to stop watching gay porn because my distain and contempt for good looking or conventionally attractive gay men in porn was getting so strong. i mean sitting there watching someone not only have sex anytime they want but get paid for it made me furious. which bring me to my next point, you say were too focused on sexual relationships when ITS EVERYWHERE. tv, media, everything is oozing with sex all the time, so cant you understand how it would make a person feel extremely inadequate not being apart of that and never having experienced sex. 

  i challenge you to make me see different."

"CMV: having children is unnecessary, it doesn’t fundamentally change you as a personality, nor it is a prerequisite of a purposeful, content life",[removed]
"CMV: As a trans woman, I believe that the mainstream feminist movement doesn't have our core interests at heart, and I no longer call myself a feminist as a result.","For context, I've been transitioned and living as a trans woman for almost 7 years, basically my entire adult life minus around 6 months or so. So I'm not new to womanhood as I've experienced it.

I was raised in a liberal household with a strong mom who rose to a very high level in her company and I respect her for it. I've always been pro life, pro women's rights, and have a desire to dismantle/reform the systems that oppress all women and other minorities alike.

But at the same time, to me it's become painfully obvious that mainstream feminism has a lot of limitations when it comes to representing all its members, especially trans women like me.

In my view, to this day, mainstream feminism was created by and for cis women, and is mainly made up of cis women. This isn't bad in of itself, as mass movements can often achieve a lot of pressure for change just by existing, but sometimes can lead to awkward situations from the overwhelming cisgender nature of things.

The pussy hats at the 2016 women's March were a prime example, as I felt like the body part reductionist message there left me feeling what place at all I had there. Why bother showing up when my mental health would become a net negative due to the glaring reminders of what I don't have (that also marked womanhood and solidarity in that specific time and place)?

That kind of stuff combined with feminist cis women who are either apathetic towards or actively opposed to trans people like me has made me care a lot more about my own trans community than their feminist one. Should I bother to change how I see this, or continue to stick with advocacy within my own community?"
CMV: Financial incentives will not solve decreasing birth rates,"A common reason I hear for decreasing birth rates is that people can no longer afford it due to increased cost of living. I disagree, I believe the main reason birth rates are decreasing is because people are simply not interested in having children.

Many countries have tried providing financial incentives to increase birth rates, (China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc). All of their birth rates are projected to continue decreasing. Even countries with the most generous child care subsidies, like the Denmark and Luxembourg, have below replacement fertility rates. 

If even the Nordic countries, which subsidize child care, high quality public education, college expenses, and healthcare (reducing the financial burden of raising a child) cannot bring their fertility rates above replacement level, it suggests that financial incentives are not enough to meaningfully increase birth rates.

I believe the biggest reason for the decrease in birth rates is because more and more people don't see children as necessary to having a meaningful life. It's no coincidence birth rates decrease as a country develops; more people (especially women) are able to be educated and find careers/afford pastimes that provide them a sense of fulfillment. This would explain why people with higher incomes/education have less children: there are more options to life.

Societal values have shifted. Back when women were discouraged from pursuing higher education and professional careers, a lot of them followed societal expectations of ""women are supposed to be mothers."" Now that the societal pressure has decreased, it's only natural that less women choose to follow the traditional lifestyle that was once pushed onto them. We see women are having children at later age, and having less children overall.

Children are a lot of work. Even if you paid me to be a parent, I wouldn't be interested, because it is a huge time commitment, it can be emotionally taxing, and can sometimes require sacrifices in our personal goals.

There was an interesting observation made on Chinese social media. The post stated that for a long time, men never understood how difficult parenting can be, since they dumped all the heavy lifting of childrearing onto their wives. Now that women have more opportunities in life, the father has a greater role in childrearing, and many Chinese fathers are realizing it was much harder than they initially thought.

After you finish your 9-5 job for the day, the second shift begins. Tantrums in the early years, worrying about your child's academic performance, making sure your child has good values and stays out of trouble, requires a lot of quality time. Considering all the implications parenting has on your career, the decrease in free time for yourself, the emotional toll of seeing your child go through hard times, I'm not surprised more people are choosing to embrace other lifestyles like DINK, being a Disney adult, or raising a pet."
CMV: emotional affairs doesn’t exist when it’s someone you have no physical attraction to,"I believe that emotional affairs are often a precursor to physical affairs. However, if the person in question is someone you have absolutely no physical attraction to, it’s just a close friend.

I’ve seen some people say emotional affairs are when you are sharing something with someone else that you wouldn’t share with your spouse because “they wouldn’t understand you”. I would agree if they are attracted to them (I.e. a straight male sharing with a straight female), but if it’s a straight man sharing it with another straight man then isn’t that fine?

I’ve also seen people say it’s when you share something with someone that you wouldn’t share with your spouse. Something intimate. This I can understand if it’s a long relationship, but if it’s early on and something happens, surely you would be more inclined to share things with your close friends rather than a new partner?


So please, CMV and let me understand this topic better."

CMV: Being friendly and sociable at an office job is a good thing.,"Being friendly and sociable promotes good networking opportunities. If a manager from another department knows who you are and you two have developed a positive relationship, then there is a good chance you might be able to work for that unit down the line.

When I first started my job, I try to say good morning and greet everyone. If I see someone, I would greet them and ask how their day is going.

This has allowed me to develop good relationship with my coworkers and people around me. It is also a good skill to develop too."
"CMV: Gender Identity is a form of freedom of expression, does not need to be logical, and should be protected everywhere.","Technically, I have 2 views here, feel free to expand/change either one.

1. Gender Identity is a form of freedom of expression, does not need to be logical.
Gender Identity from Oxford dictionary:
""a person's innate sense of their gender""
Additionally, It is often aligned with one biological sex, but it might not be the case and can be ""trans"" during one lifespan.

Since it is based on one feeling, it is purely subjective and does not need to be logical.

2. Gender Identity should be a protected form of expression everywhere.
To have and be proud of oneself gender identity WILL NOT BE harmful to others.
Therefore, gender identity should be protected everywhere.
By everywhere, I really mean everywhere, not just specific countries.

My Limit,
to change view #1:

let me hear the reason on why gender identity needs to be logical, not your own personal reason, more like government reason, or study reason with cause and effect.

the reason should be strong enough so the definition from the dictionary needs to be changed/enhanced.

to change view #2:
preferably With a cost-benefit analysis of protecting gender identity.

Let's have a conversation."
CMV: People need to calm down about the pride flag mural in Fort Lauderdale being ran over,"As reported by NBC Miami:

&gt; Fort Lauderdale Police are investigating after a pride flag street mural was defaced with tire marks.
The incident happened back on Feb. 28 on Sebastian Street, where the 150-foot long flag is painted on the ground.
According to a police report, a surveillance camera captured the driver of a Ford F-250 pickup truck doing a burnout along the length of the mural before leaving the scene.

Whether it was intentional or not, isn't it obvious that anything painted on the road is going to get scuffed? I've even heard people saying that this is some sort of hate crime! How on God's green earth is this a hate crime? As far as I can tell, people need to calm down and understand that something like this is bound to happen, at least once, if something is painted in the middle of the road.

Also, I love how the mainstream media literally loses its mind when a pride flag is driven over, but the BLM riots were apparently ""speaking the language of the unheard."" People need a little more common sense and understanding."
cmv:Canada is not much more democratic than China,[removed]
CMV: Conservative Trans people exist," One of the real tragedies of contemporary politics is that our most bitter disagreements are about something that doesn’t even exist—the political spectrum. Left and right are entirely tribal designations and have no unifying philosophy or principle behind them that can be represented on a unidimensional spectrum.

This may sound like an absurd claim, but before rejecting out of hand, consider that the political spectrum rests on an essentialist theory of ideology that has been soundly falsified. The essentialist theory says that, although it may seem that there are many distinct political issues in politics, there is actually just one big issue—an underlying essence that ties them all together (e.g., change vs. preservation, equality vs. freedom, order vs. liberty, realism vs. idealism, etc.). If politics is unidimensional (about one essential issue), then a unidimensional political spectrum is adequate to represent politics.

 The common retort of many essentialists is that conservatives or liberals who switch their positions so easily aren’t “true conservatives” or “true liberals” But in this, the essentialists are falling prey to the “private language fallacy”—the erroneous belief that a *private* individual can arbitrarily determine the meaning of *public* words. The thousands of Fox News-watching, Bush-voting, Limbaugh-listening, CPAC-supporting people in these studies call themselves “conservatives,” the media calls them “conservatives,” and the politicians they support are coded as “conservative” in ideological voting measures; they are, therefore, “real conservatives” in the only sense that it’s possible to be a “real conservative.” Because there is no transcendent definition of ideology beyond the tribe, those who compose the liberal and conservative tribes are, by definition, “true” liberals and conservatives. Those who insist otherwise might be falling prey to motivated reasoning–seeking to justify their own ideology by appealing to principle.

I understand why so many of us want to believe in the political spectrum—it makes politics simple and gives us the illusion that our party’s beliefs have an underlying (and righteous) philosophical coherence—but it’s time to face up to the facts. “Right-wing” and “left-wing” are little more than tribal designations. Shedding our jerseys might help us become more rational, more humble, less tribal, and ultimately, more open-minded when it comes to public issues."
CMV: I think the United States of America 🇺🇸should step back from the trying to preserving democracy in other countries and do some self healing. Here’s my simplistic and flawed take.

WHAT THE EU

needs to do just step up and incentivize “our” way of democracy or countries who choose for themselves to live in peace &amp; equanimity. The countries that followed should be offered funding “if willing accept” only to help rebuild their economies as do lead in their rights to lead a  nation.

No artillery No militarization tolerated.

Maybe push  for demilitarization in parts of the world where two bordering nations wish. In hopes of showing the rest of the world  that peace thrives

I don’t think having a utopian world with united countries is impossible

Each nation has their choice in the EU . , and with that should come accountability from everyone in a government position . Journalism should be cherished, “real” news whatever it may be should be looked upon in

As for Americans

in the most simplest way of explaining it. We have a list of problems we need to starts checking off immediately. Look to California for example. Millions of dollars and you find that “humans” gum that system up. THROWING MONEY AT  PROBLEMS does not work It even sounds dumb typing it, is that not technically what California is doing with at the very  least a few of their travesties. We would probably have to make a statement on seeking HEAVY prosecution of those who take governmental positions only to favor in corruption, if convicted that is.

IMO:Most important thing is fixing the voting system. With surplus amount of people in the country it’s a fact that most people aren’t fucking psycho that you meet on a day to day basis so there’s the point in making the voting system more efficient.

it’s sooo  obvious This country has potential to self correct. And if you don’t think so then what are we doing here ? There’s problems it can be fixed. More people just have to have an influence.

Majority should lead the authority  on any matter. Wouldn’t you agree ?

Oh and something should be done about “conflict of interest” situations In any government involvement like legal battles with citizens. It’s a naughty tactic that I believe has been used IMO  just Incase I didn’t miss any.

This is just my opinion though but In reality nothing will be done 🤷‍♂️

Last thought. We’re all gonna die and whether or not when the lights go out you go up into the big sky or something. The fact of the matter is that there is only one Earth.

"CMV: Especially with social media, there needs to be some kind of censorship","The debate of censorship has been beat down ad nauseam and I'll admit, I used to be on the side of absolutely no censorship and allow the marketplace of ideas to run it's course. However, this slowly changed as my world views shifted slightly.

I think the best analogy I can use is 4chan compared to Reddit. A lot of Reddit mods are weird assholes who are power hungry (keep in mind, these weirdos are doing this shit for free, which is even more weird when you think about it). However, there are still a lot of mods who are just trying to be fair and do their job (usually the cooler mods are in smaller subs).

Now in contrast, 4chan is actually a fucking cesspool. You have the most objectively racists POS conversing on their with their shield of anonymity. I don't care how young they might be or what their background is, it's genuinely unsettling to know there are people out there who can even contemplate some of the things they are saying.

I think there has to be some kind of moderation, especially with social media. You just cannot allow humans to propagate ANY ideas because of free speech. The real issue in my opinion is whether or not the mods have abused their power and overstepped their powers. I can totally understand how some people think having no censorship is the ideal solution. I just think it's not going to be achievable because there is always some degenerate asshole out there who will say or do things most of us couldn't even conceive of."

CMV: Humans are moral.,"I know I've posted this before, but some people tended to stop responding quickly or just not providing reasoning. The mods can remove it if they want. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here it is:

Just because we do something good and it makes us feel good doesn't mean it was selfish. 

a. That isn't necessarily WHY we did it

b. It's not PLEASURE when we feel good in this case, it's aesthetic from the moral situation. Therefore, the DIRECT reason, at least, is that that is the moral state of the situation. Why you want that moral state? Fair, it could be selfish, but still, my point stands. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a common argument:

Evolution: First of all, evolution can't think. It can't be selfish. Second of all, it is an ECOLOGICAL process that determines WHICH ORGANISMS DOMINATE, not why the individual organisms are like that. 

  
Anyway, feel free to defend this point and/or offer other one(s). But PROVIDE REASONING(and definitions since sometimes they conflict), and don't accuse me of being unwilling to change my view. And don't just explain the idea or offer an explanation. If that happens, I'll block you until you stop, because that's NOT WHAT THIS POST IS FOR.

CMV: I think it’s okay to have race swapped characters. It’s not always about being woke.,"Let me start off by saying… that I am probably against “woke” ideology 9/10.

I’ve seen titles like Peter Pan, Velma &amp; The Little Mermaid get crap for having characters ethnicities change from the original. 

In those cases, I DO think they are doing it to be woke. Their track record and/or (in the case of Velma) flat out state it. 

However I don’t think that always has to be the case. 

If the persons ethnicity has absolutely no bearing on the story, I don’t see why it matters what actor or actress plays them.

I think there is is nuance involved and many other things. Story, writing and the track record of the studio. 

Like if Amazon/MGM make Idris Alba the next 007. I wouldn’t see that as being woke. You simply have a British actor with a name that would probably bring people to the theater. I don’t think it would be woke in that case. 


So, could someone possibly explain why there is no way around wokeness in race swapping?"
CMV: Western society needs to be more appreciated and protected. It’s unfairly hated on.,"When I say “western society” I’m speaking about countries like the USA, UK, Canada etc. I’ve been seeing a rise in hatred towards western society lately. People saying it’s become too “woke”, that we have lost our values, that western society is dying a slow death. Don’t get me wrong, no society is or will ever be perfect. Western society has its flaws, however if we look at it from a historical perspective I would argue that western society has provided its citizens with some of the most stable, RELATIVELY safe, overall good quality of life in human history. 

The freedom of choosing whatever religion you want to be, having the opportunity to become successful and make a business, average life span of 80 years old, good healthcare, good education, ability to travel, these are all things westerners have come to EXPECT, however rarely in history did people ever have such luxuries. After World War II western countries had seen stability and growth for decades and decades. 

There’s a reason western countries lead and have lead for a long time in human development indexes, happiness indexes, freedom of press indexes, freedom &amp; safety indexes. 

If people really want to see the fall of the west, I’d say be careful with what you replace it with."

If you’re recording your good deeds for internet clout, that’s not charity, it’s a neutral exchange.

CMV: social media companies should never be held accountable for content moderation or be required to moderate content by the government.,"There is a big push on social media companies by the governments of countries around the world to increase content moderation.  In some cases the social media companies are threatened with legal action over content created by everyday people. I believe that this is wrong.

Social media companies are not media companies. They are a town square. They are a mall. They are the places that we all go to talk and share our ideas in perspectives. A Town square is not held accountable for people's inappropriate ideas or perspectives. Nor is a mall. 

A government has the responsibility of enforcing any restrictions on freedom of speech on its own citizens. I don't have a problem with them enforcing their rules on people but don't make a social media company do your police work .

To me this seems like common sense. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me as well as a lot of governments. I would like to better understand another perspective. To be clear I'm not stating that I think people should be able to say anything they want to I am also not sharing my perspective on freedom of speech. I am only sharing my perspective on the role that social media companies play in society today."
CMV: Total Abolitionists who wish to eliminate the prison system do not truly believe that (California CDCR perspective),"**Introduction**

Correctional Abolitionism is a rapid-growing ideology in today's society. Past social media and advocacy, the concept of abolitionism has entered law school forums and the legal curriculum itself. See from [Harvard](https://harvardcrcl.org/a-safe-and-flourishing-future-one-law-students-case-for-abolition/); [Columbia](https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/abolition-practicum); and [UCLA](https://law.ucla.edu/events/abolition-legal-field-discussion-about-abolitionism-classroom-and-beyond). (Note: These examples vary in approach; my argument will not be focused on these contents' paradigm.) As a personal anecdote, having attend various legal panels and seminars hosted on law school campuses, abolitionism seems to be more ""trending"" now more than ever.

This is not to say there are not issues with the current criminal law system and certain laws. For example, Three Strikes law still exists in California. There are many good arguments against it. But that point also envelops the solution: the law is constantly changing, and its amenable nature makes it imperative to work within its system to progress change rather than deconstruct it entirely.

I have had plenty of debate with abolitionists, from formal to informal settings, who have focused on various issues, i.e. racial disparities or the private prison complex, to justify total abolitionism. While these concerns have merit for discussion, these do not warrant the ""total abolitionist"" ideology. Instead, I see these abolitionists as highly opinionated and critical of the correctional system, but I do not believe any ""total abolitionist"" believes what they are claiming.

The ""total abolitionist"" perspective I am arguing against: ""**Abolition rejects the expansion of** [**all aspects of the prison industrial complex**](http://correctionsproject.com/wordpress/portfolio/prison-maps/#jp-carousel-644)**.** **This means eliminating prisons and police as well as removing “policing” from society.** ""

I do not believe any abolitionist truly believes in eliminating prisons, outside of it being a talking point. I am open to having my mind changed as I truly want to be convince of at least one reasonable argument. But I have yet to discover an argument consistent with viable solutions and incorporate enough nuance that merits any legitimate considerations. For my mind to be changed, I'd love all three premises to be reasonably challenged (in the context of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.)

**Context**

I am aware of people having tough times and making difficult life decisions / mistakes, and the importance for rehabilitation. Thanks to the correctional system, they gain vocational skills, college educations, and much needed self-help trainings and programming (i.e. CALPIA) to re-enter society. Another underrated aspect is developing suitable parole plans: Once they get out, where will they stay? Do they have a support network? Will they have work to sustain themselves? Will they be in the best position possible to not revert to criminal behavior? These are all services that my State provides to the inmate. These are measures so a former criminal who committed lewd and lascivious acts against a child do not get tempted when they see a child on the street. Someone who murdered someone for rejecting him develops the self-control needed to not do it again.

**Premises**

I believe abolitionists, specifically in California, who are against the correctional system are very uneducated on the subject; in fact, I truly believe **they don't believe** what they are arguing. The main premises for my position:

***1) Regarding total abolitionists - those who believe in fully abolishing the prison system - do not have viable nor practicable solutions for malicious crimes.***

The premise explains itself. Someone murders twelve kids. How does an abolitionist suppose we deal with them?

***2) The argument that criminal punishment should only focus on rehabilitation rather than be punitive unjustifiably undercut theories of retribution.***

Why should your ""perfect world"" views take precedent over hurting victims and their families who want to feel relief and justice? If it was my wife badly beaten and assaulted, I would want them to receive punishment. You would the same if someone kidnapped, assaulted, and murdered your nephews and nieces. Why do your outside feelings take precedent over those directly impacted?

***3) Our current system, and improving this system, is the best way to rehabilitate inmates.***

It's hard to see **how or why** an abolitionist would disagree with CDCR's approach. Rehabilitating and reducing recidivism is exactly what states have been doing through proper programming. A total abolitionist view seems more argumentative than substantive.

I'd include that in my State we are accommodating inmates more than than necessary -- in fact, we even allowed inmates to create their own podcasts distributed throughout prison radios. The State provides inmates commissary catalogues, allowing them to buy Nike shoes, watches, etc.

**Conclusion**

I think I made my points clear! Tl;dr total abolitionism / eliminating the prison system as a whole is more argumentative than substantive. It 1) does not provide practicable nor viable solutions for malicious crimes 2) rehabilitation &gt; punishment does not fit the script for every crime and is unfair to victim families and 3) our current system and improving it is the best balance between punishment and rehabilitation and the best way to rehabilitate inmates already. Withstanding these three premises, it is impossible for someone to truly believe in total abolitionism."
Cmv: west started the new cold war,"Russia changed a lot after Soviet collapse. As a matter of fact, Russia tried to “change itself” from the very moment when Mikhail Gorbachev became “gensek” in 1985, and kept trying till 2002 (someone could say 2004, but let’s keep it low), in order to “join the European Union”, or however, to find a common language with the West (EU, USA, take your pick). And then it said “WTF”…

Gorbachev asked to join EU before 1991. He had done already (or was going to do) a lot: he had brought the boys back home from Afghanistan, he let the Germans tear down the Berlin Wall, he promoted “Glasnost” and Perestroyka” at home (in a quite voluntaristic and even a bit unthoughtful way, talking with hindsight, but anyway). But EU say “no”. The rationale was more or less the same you say now: “you are too big” (no pun intended).

Then they drove the old USSR down (and all the bells were singing, for a while). Russia went through what we all know, but few of us can really imagine (the life expectancy for men fell from 64 years in 1990 to 59 in 2000: nuff said). The local “liberals” whored out the same names and concepts of “liberalism” and “democracy” (do you know what “derhmocracy” means? Well, remember Cambronne…) in order to “change Russia” and join the West. And then there was Putin. But even Putin tried to “join EU”. After all, Russia was smaller than USSR. But it was “too big” yet for Brussels.

Meanwhile, with a decision that the great American diplomat George Kennan (the father of anti-Soviet “containment”, so, a man beyond any suspect) criticized to death (“it’s the beginning of a new cold war”, he said), the Clintonian USA had “supported” (euphemism) the first enlargement of NATO till the former Soviet borders, and stuffed EU with pro-American (and anti-Russian) proxies (through the action of UK, of course: a real US Troyan horse in the EU, as De Gaulle had forecasted).

So the attempts of Russia (and of the “Old Europeans”) to find a common language between Russia and EU (let alone to start the path toward an association of Russia, if not a full blown membership) became even harder, not to say impossible. And mostly NOT for Russian responsibility. Yes, there was the SECOND Chechen war. But, when Eltsin started the FIRST (without a provocation as the Basayev’s attack to Dagestan -August 1999-), Clinton praised him comparing him to Lincoln. So, what are we talking about?

And then there was September 11 (or as I prefer to call it: “the sequel of Rambo 3”). The Russians had warned USA for years about the danger the radical islamist groups they had created, funded, armed, trained or all-the-above-together could create to them too, and even offered their cooperation to contrast them, but proud USA always loftily dismissed this proposal, and let their former allies get them with their trousers down.

After the attack, Putin offered his sympathy and something more to Bush (intelligence cooperation, free passage to US supplies and even a base -Ulyanovsk- to support the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, plus the Russian-backed Northern Alliance as a boots-on-the-ground force against Al Qaida and the Talibans, etc.). What was the “thank you” for all of that? Bush announced the US withdrawal from ABM treaty, a pillar of MAD and of the power balance between Russia and USA. Go do such people a favor…

At that point, the goodwill of Russian toward “the West” was already quite low (it was 80% in 1990, 40% in 1999, 20% in 2002). The last straw came around 2004, when the NATO passed the borders of USSR with the entry of the Baltic states. Russians had already some axes to grind with them about the way they treated the local Russian-speaking minority (non-citizen status, treatments which are usual for immigrants applied to people born, living and working in the same country since decades, etc.), but to figure US bombers and missiles based just a few minutes away from Saint Petersburg was not the kind of things that could ease the mutual relations.

And indeed, they got worse. Not only with the Balts, but with the EU (they had entered there too, always thanks to UK -and Poland-), and let alone with the US of A.

It was in 2007, that Putin gave the famous Munich speech, which boiled down to a simple concept: “enough is enough: get lost!”. And the bulk of Russian people was fully agreeing with him.

As an epilogue, I will quote the words that a grinning Russian diplomat said to his Western colleagues some years ago, answering their shock about the increasing contacts between Russia and China: “If a girl tells a boy “NO” too many times, the boy looks for another girl”."

"CMV: We should be electing two governments, one for social issues and one for economics","As the title says, I believe that if we divided governments into two parts, it would be beneficial for everyone of us.

My main reasons for believing this is:

- We could separate our economic, social and political (For political I mean things like foreign politics) beliefs, so that someone who is, for example, socially conservative and more left leaning economically doesn't have to decide whether he values more his social or economical beliefs.

- As I said, we wouldn't have to trade our social or economic beliefs for their counterpart: this way, we don't risk being stuck with economic or social politics we don't like just because in that moment we value more the other one (I see this all the time: some people dislike most right-leaning social beliefs, but much prefer their economics).

- In my idea, there could not be any crossover between economic and social parties: this would make parties less divided and much more focused on their objectives, without the need to balance social politics and economics. Parties would also need to cater to a smaller audience, so that their beliefs would be a little less nuanced and less diluted.

Obviously, I recognize how some issues may arise from this:

- Some economic and political doctrines are somewhat incompatible with each other, making it harder for the two parts of the government to cooperate

- There isn't a hard divide between economics and social politics: they are extremely connected, to that also makes it harder for the two parts to cooperate. Defining what is the field of the economic government and what is the field of the social government could also be difficult.

However, I'd expect that it would be hard for completely opposite social and economic doctrines to find themselves in the government, as social beliefs are connected with economic beliefs and vice versa, so that I wouldn't expect, for example, to find democratic socialists and hardline conservatives together in the government. 

I'd also put an executive political figure that would try to unite the two parts and help them cooperate and harmonize their different beliefs (It could be an elected president or, as I would prefer, a monarch, or anything else.)

Why CMV: As much as I am interested in politics, I am no expert, so there is likely something serious I'm missing that would make this system crumble completely."

"CMV: We will redistribute wealth with UBI or first world society as we know it collapses, no other options","I would like my view changed so I can better understand why other people are not concerned about this. Is there something I don't know? AI is going to knock out most jobs, corporate profits will continue to rise. That is actually fine, just need to tax that money and redistribute it. 

Is there some third scenario I can't comprehend where most peoples jobs are knocked out, there is no UBI, and people continue to function normally?

It would be nice to see a less bleak future. Or it would be nice if people at least agreed on how to make the future not bleak."
"CMV: It is okay to be willfully ignorant, anti-intellectual and isolated as long as you don't hurt anyone else","I am a person unable to deal with the realization that moral nihilism is true, in the sense that stuff like stealing, rape and murder is not objectively wrong. All laws are arbitrary and the meaning behind the word ""should"" does not exist or is just used as meaning what is good for your selfish biological survival. It makes me depressed and makes me not want to fight for any ideals because it means I just value ideals for selfish reasons or pointless reasons.

I am a person too dumb to be an engineer and to old to be a soldier, but I am physically fit enough to have a job or do some kind of volunteer stuff. However, when I have tried doing all those things I just have to keep a mask on all the time and the exhaustion of it all means I arguably never truly contribute. I also definitely should not do political work since my fear of nihilism means I lean toward authoritarian stuff, like Plato's noble lie and censorship of art. I could easily become the useful idiots of fascists, since I sort of glorify enlightened dictatorships.

I am currently living on a sort of welfare agreement with the social services in my country. I am receiving welfare as long as I study. However, **I am only studying to stay on welfare,** not to study something to one day become smart and give back to society. I lack common sense and whatever other people have that causes them to believe and know something is true. I generally doubt things as much as possible by default.

Expected counter argument :""**You should try talking to a psychologist or philosophical counseling"".**  I had a digital appointment with philosopher that also had degree in psychology. I asked him if it was possible to be an atheist and believe in moral universalism, something like Kantian deontology for atheist's. He said no, and said he personally believe humans being have to chose a system and willfully lie to themselves to survive.  He was brutally honest, which I did not expect, but I guess I am glad he was. Well, I wish he told me lies to be honest, but it's too late now.

Expected counter argument 2: **You are not contributing anything to society.**  Yes, this is true. But this is sort of the point of my CMV, though. I mean, how exactly am I to contribute anyway? I guess having children is the most needed thing for western countries, but I think only fully mentally stable and healthy people should have children. It is better to have less children than more but they are unhappy or unsafe. Also, I do spend some of my money on consuming culture and support art. Well, actually art and stories make me sad as well.

I do not intend to harm anyone or steal (the exception to the stealing is being on welfare I guess). I think that everything I am doing should be seen as okay. I will avoid philosophy, which makes me depressed but not force anti-intellectualism on other people. I also won't be rude to people or not offer help in situations like where people fall over or ask me to hold a door open. I would also call the police and firemen if someone was in trouble, of course. I guess I will always behave so because of a holdover in my mind thinking those things are good or bad.

Want to me it clear I am open to changing my view. I actually want to since I think my view is seen as shameful and wrong.

Also, please don't recommend r/askphilosophy. They don't like questions like this and will remove it quickly, or I will have to rephrase it to the degree I will get no answer that is relevant to my actual individual situation.

Thank you for reading. If you have any questions feel free to ask!"

"CMV: The people of the United States have the right to refer to their country as ""America"" if they want.","(Disclaimer: I'm not from the United States of America, but I'm also not Latin American either.)

I'm a huge believer in self-determination on scales as small as the individual and as large as nations. I generally think that groups of people should be allowed to determine who they are and how they want to show themselves to the world. Of course, we can never control other people's perception, but we can self identify and try to shape that perception. 

In recent years I've seen a lot of people (mostly on the internet) arguing that referring to the US as ""America"" is a misnomer because ""America"" refers to a continent (or two continents, depending on your worldview). I think this argument often comes from people living in Latin America, but there could be others, I'm not certain. I've seen some people argue this from a linguistics standpoint, like calling the US ""America"" is a grammatical error, and I've seen others make an anti-imperialist case, arguing that Americans (or United Statesians, maybe) are trying to assert themselves as the masters of the Western Hemisphere.

I think policing language is often (though certainly not always) unproductive. It seems to me like this is a case of outsiders (people not from the US) trying to police how people inside the US describe themselves. I think that Americans should be allowed to call themselves whatever they feel. Beyond this, I think the linguistic argument just doesn't work. Most North American english speakers don't think of ""America"" as being a word for a single continent, they think of ""North America"" and ""South America"" (or maybe ""The Americas"")."
CMV: Celebrities shouldn’t get backlash for working with unethical brands.,"Celebrities always get a bunch of backlash for doing deals or working with companies who have done some unethical things. 

One example is athletes signed to Nike, I seen some people on Reddit bashing nba players for supporting and working with Nike despite them using child labour in developing countries. 

But why is it always the athletes or celebrities getting the backlash? What about the company actually putting kids to work? Or the millions of people buying Nike. 

Lebron James for example is signed to Nike. But Nike is paying him and promoting his product Lebron obviously gets a clear benefit from this. What’s the excuse for the average person who willingly spends hundreds to thousands of hard earned money at Nike each year though? They have no benefit and are actually paying a premium to shop at Nike.

In this instance I would say the average person is more guilty as they are supporting child labour for nothing and could spend less elsewhere. 

Not to mention you never hear Nike or Amazon employees get backlash but they work for and benefit from the same companies. What’s the difference between them and an athlete sponsor they both work with the company for a paycheque and could go elsewhere."
CMV: there is no reason to assume animals can’t experience love like we can.,"A question I keep asking myself is this: why do people act like every instance of animals showing affection can be explained away as different than ours?

I’ve heard people say things like “dogs don’t really love you, they just love that you give them food.” And I guess I just don’t really understand because we could do the same with humans if we applied that logic consistently. 

“Oh, you don’t really love your family. You’re just conditioned to show them affection because they raised you and gave you food. You’re biologically wired to stick close to them because often times that would have given you a bigger chance for survival in the wild.”

Why are people so determined to separate themselves from animals? Sure humans are different from a lot of other species in the world, but every species is unique. If the affection shown by animals isn’t indicative of love, then how can we say that the affection we feel and show is? 

I guess I should clarify I am not speaking about all animals here, but mostly about mammals who have an amygdala. 

If we’re willing to call our own biological feelings “love” then I don’t get why we can’t call that of animals the same."
"CMV: USD isnt worth it anymore. The amount of time it takes to earn X amount of dollars, isn't worth the goods it can afford. Most employment is a means of imprisonment in a downward spiral of standard of living.","The time needed to care for ones self to maintain their health, is nickeled and dimed away from them for USD amounts which dont well reflect the implicated costs of healthcare which arise from stress, injuries, diet stressors, lack of flexibility in what and when to eat or rest, or even accomodate medical intervention appointments.

The time needed to pay for childcare at median wages, is not worth the USD recieved by working instead. The cost of daily transporting the child, supplying daycare with extra supplies which may have been made more cost efficient by having the flexibility to manage on a schedule at home, deposits, and the costs of losing work to go pick them up in emergency or sickness; as one still pays the entire month cost regardless of their absences at daycare, but at work, one still loses all their pay for those absences which are spent attending to the child not at daycare.

Median wages are not enough to have secure and reliable access to appropriate healthcare, dental too.

Median wages are not enough to accomodate sustainable finances for individuals or families. One healthcare incident, broken tooth, car or transport issue, eviction, job loss, fall down the stairs, a bonk on the head, a cyst, cancer, a heart attack, a baby, a legal accusation, a divorce, a disease, someone just not liking you and termintating/sabotaging/etc you, a rape or sexual abuse event, an imprisonment for a crime you did or did not commit, a traffic stop cop who wants to fuck with you, a car wreck, a missed bill, a fire, theft, even a mere misunderstanding, layoffs, and so much more...
Are all VERY capable of irreperable loss, snowball exacerbations of one another, homelessness, losing your family, home, health, or even losing access to the paltry government support services which are already inadequate.

Its cute when people tell me they're 'doing fine.'.. Vast majority of the United States citizens will be fumbling to explain how 'this is crazy, you dont understand, i wasnt always like this...its just that...well you see..' Mhm. You can work hard as a mf'r, let yourself be exploited with a smile, but you aren't gonna come out with any different odds than every other person, bud. 
Spare us of the hubris, you aren't more hardworking than most poor people. You just haven't had your time yet. Time is ticking, and youre not in control. All life needs is a little, tiny, nick in the glass for the whole thing to begin to crack and then shatter.

Dependency on USD is an irresponsible approach to life. For well over half the nation, employment doesnt provide enough income to justify the costs of time lost to work. Nor does it provide any pragmatic means of provisioning one with the ability to reliably provide basic needs to themselves or even their children. I wouldnt peg it as an approach of being a responsible parent, anymore. The costs, even through an optimistic lens, outweigh the gains of employment.

Considering all this, I reflect on the reason we 'need' USD. It doesnt grow plants, it isnt land i can live on, isnt edible, doesnt light up, doesnt watch my children, doesnt heal my body... It is because even the very basic needs of life, food, land, safety, etc. are actively withheld from us, hostage until we sell our time for USD to often the same entities which take that USD and only then allow us an arbitrary amount of resources for it.

Fleets, millions of tonnes, of food that wasnt bought, toys unopened, tools unused, medications unused and so much more are buried in landfills en masse daily. Not because nobody needed them. Not because nobody wanted them. Quite the opposite. It was done as a result of ensuring that they were withheld from people who needed or wanted them, but didnt have more USD to give for them. Millions of tonnes a day, buried in the earth, specifically to make sure nobody could have them; because nobody had come forth with the USD to give for them. Regardless of a dying human, a child with special needs, any regard for other species, international needs, repurposing concepts, charities, or just making the lives easier for the working people of the nation who sacrifice everything to keep things running. Without infldulging further into it, full automation is not 'ways away', it is coming, faster and faster. Artificial scarcity is well known and observed.

Employment wages are no longer an efficient or practical approach for meeting the needs of over half the country. USD is a lost cause, as it is not amidst an economic architecure which enables any degree of functional circulating rate before being heavily reconcentrated amidst a small group. 

It is not responsible as a parent to continue the idea of employment being the right answer. Our children's lives are at stake, and we devote nearly all our waking hours to an ideal and corporations which knowingly exploit us; and leave us unable to provide or fight for a respectable life for our children.

We have a fiduciary duty to our children, yet we do not act in their best interest as parents, by giving away our time and labor for less than appropriate prices. Its legally arguable that you are abusive and a failure as a parent; by not withholding labor, ideally collectively, to demand for far higher wages to provide for yourself and your child.

This includes me, too. I'm failing my son by conceding my labor away for so little. He barely knows me, as I have to work so much. We have so little, and have lost even more.

CMV: The prison sentence for killing someone while driving drunk should be an automatic life sentence.,"Normally, life sentences are for people guilty of Murder 1 or Murder 2. A majority of people who kill someone while driving drunk fall under involuntary vehicular manslaughter. 

That makes sense.

If you cause an accident and someone else dies, but you were sober while behind the wheel, as long as you didn't do something egregiously negligent, I get it. It happens. It's unfortunate, but it happens.

HOWEVER, I am certain that 99% of people who drive drunk drank voluntarily and voluntarily got behind the wheel knowing they were drunk. Factoring that into consideration, if you cause a fatal accident when you voluntarily drank and voluntarily got behind the wheel of a two-ton machine while you knew you were drunk, you are the literal scum of the earth and a selfish irresponsible human being.

Because you put yourself in an inebriated state ON YOUR OWN VOLITION and while in said inebriated state got behind the wheel ON YOUR OWN VOLITION and caused a fatal accident, your charge should still be vehicular manslaughter, but your prison sentence should be the same as if you committed 1st or 2nd degree murder."

CMV: Expressing Anger in Public is Not Good,"Have you ever seen someone flip out in public over the littlest thing? Do you think that that’s ever acceptable or that angry outbursts are just a normal part of life? Or do you think that we should keep our anger out of the public space if it isn't in direct response to unkindness or discrimination or something. I was talking to my friend the other day about anger, and he says he loves being angry in public. He thinks it's more cathartic to get angry and have people see it. He says it makes him feel understood or seen or something? I don't get that at all. I saw a girl the other night start screaming at a pizza shop because they didn’t have pepperoni. Then she burst into tears and I overheard her tragic backstory of what seemed like a really tough year. 

I feel like this may be a gendered and cultural issue as well, because I was raised in a culture that discouraged anger and presented shame and sadness as an alternative. So for me, if I was ever angry, I would usually just cry. I also came from a household where anger, even if it existed in the interactions that I had, were always hidden in the household. Like when I was little, and I had done something to upset my mom, she would turn to me and grit her teeth and whisper to me to wait until we got home.

I can imagine the importance of anger in resistance or reaction to like discrimination or as a form of activism. That makes sense, even if I couldn’t personally do it. But anger that’s personal should not be displayed in public because it causes an upset to everyone and you are pushing it onto everyone else. But also I can understand how it might be beneficial to express it out loud, and how doing something out loud for people to see might make it more likely for someone to help you. Or maybe even just for you to understand your own feelings by expressing anger in a place where you see other people’s reactions. 

After seeing that girl cry she seemed like her friends were nicer to her, not meaner to her after, and I found that unusual. She didn’t even apologize to the worker. Anyway, what do you think? Have you ever been in a situation like that? Losing your temper and then feeling better? 

Have you guys ever had a public angry outburst? Have you seen someone else have one? What happened? Did they get in trouble? Did they calm down after they stopped yelling or just get amped up? I’ve seen some people freak out on friends, workers, and even strangers before on the street. What's the craziest thing you’ve ever seen?  Do you think it helps to be angry in public?"
CMV: Progressives are making political polarization worse by stoking/encouraging tribalism,"Im probably going to be gaslit into being told this doesn’t happen, but basically I’ve interacted with many progressives in real life, as well as consumed a lot of progressive media, and progressives often espouse narratives that are highly critical of white, straight, and/or male identity or characteristics as having unfair, undue, or problematic influence in society.

This is stoking tribalism and polarization, because when you whole sale categorize and judge an entire one group of people based on one singular  basic characteristic, you inevitably mischaracterized enough “exceptions” that your world view begins to come across as reductionist at best. 

Furthermore, judging a group of people based on one singular characteristic is just…unfair and wrong. But when this is called out, progressives defend it. Worse, progressives establish double standards.

It’s okay to get upset at “white people” in general for being racist, but if black people or Hispanic people are racist it’s somehow- excused. If Christians are homophobic it causes an uproar- if Muslims are homophobic the conversation goes “what about Christians!!1”.

CMV: The war in Afghanistan was *always* going to turn out this way.,"Afghanistan isn't viewed as a country to the majority of the Afghan people. It's a massive area of land filled with different tribes that *don't want to* modernize. 

The US and our allies could've stayed another 40 years, but the Taliban was always going to come back as soon as we left. Afghanistan will never be able to get its shit together with outside help. They have to do it themselves.

The US and our allies made schools, hospitals, and so much more just for them to give up immediately and lose it all in two weeks. 

All of that time wasted for nothing. I've got family members that were killed in that stupid fucking war. And for what?

Nothing.

The Afghans let us and their people down. Let them be. They don't want help."
CMV: The term cracker is as bad if not worse than the N-Word,"Obligatory “if you won’t even say the other word that one is worse” I refuse to say the N  word because I’m not black and they’ve made it that even using it like this will mean I’m racist and most likely get me banned from Reddit so I’ll continue to use “N word”.

So here’s why I say this. Cracker is a horrible racial slur used against white people that was thought up around the same time as the n-word. It is a term initially used to describe poor southern white people. White people who were objectively oppressed by the rich landowners of the south (the same people who were oppressing slaves). 

This term was then reclaimed by the poor people that it was attached to and became a point of pride, (like another word). However, in the 60s it was then appropriated by blacks who decided to make the term a good old fashion racial slur. Used to slander white people as racists (ironic) and make white people feel lesser.

So the word cracker is a parallel to the n-word in terms of the history of oppression behind it and the reclaiming of the word. For this reason it is historically equivalent. Do it is just as bad of a word and should be considered of the same level of racial slur.

However the n word was not then taken away after becoming a point of pride. It became a racial slur that is just acceptable. This is where I think it in many ways becomes worse. If I go down the street and get called a cracker no one will care in fact people will call me racist for being offended. If I call a black person their equivalent of cracker I’ll probably get shot and everyone will say I deserve it.

It’s worse because it’s acceptable and common. Because no one cares about white peoples who experience racism. Because after you get called it you get no sympathy, just hate."
CMV: People who hate life should just go,"I know that this sounds terrible. I want my opinion to change, so here I am. 

There are those people who wake up every single day in a bad mood. Those who have no interests in life, aren't excited about anything, and every single day they just want the day to pass, and every day is like this. Those people might have people who love them and who can't give them up, who feel responsible for them. But no matter what their loved ones do, those life-unexcited people don't change. They keep waking up in a bad mood, having a bad day, and making everyone else's day bad too. The closer you are to such a dementor person, the more you are affected by them and their moods. 

I understand that people like this are severely depressed and need help. Some even get help for years and years but nothing really changes. They live their miserable lives and make lives of their loved ones miserable too. So, seriously, just go. Don't torture yourself, and don't torture everyone around. You're not going to be a productive member of the society, and you don't want life anyways, so there's no reason to stay, unless you're working your ass off to get better and hoping to end up being happy finally. But if they don't want that, they should just go."

CMV: We are using the word Incel way too loosely and way too frequently and it’s damaging and dangerous,"I get the impression that there are a large group of extremist anti-Incel people online. These angry self-righteous condescending know-it-alls seem to not be able to tell the difference between an Incel (i.e. a group of violent misogynist who hate women and who feel that people all them sex) and genuine innocent people who struggle to form sexual relationships. Let’s call the latter group compulsory virgins. I know it’s not a very accurate term because someone might not be a virgin but still be dissatisfied with their sex life, but it’s the best I can think of so let’s stick with compulsory virgins (CV) for this post. 

CVs are by definition innocent and free of any hatred or misogyny

But from my experience when a CV dares to talk about their struggles in the dating field, or expresses so much as a minute hint of frustration at their situation, they are labelled as Incel. “oh that’s incel-ish“, “oh you’re a loser, you’re giving off incel vibes”. 

Suppose there’s a football player, let’s call him Barry. Barry is a very skilled and passionate player, and wants to join a football team. This football team persistently rejects Barry. The football team is known to be very cliquey. They generally only allow their tight group of friends and family to join the team. The manager has a strong bias towards short players, who he sees as fast and agile, will dismiss anyone who is above a certain height. (These are all examples, the details don’t matter.)

Barry finds this mildly frustrating. He’s kind of annoyed, but *he also recognises that the football team is a private enterprise, they can play with whoever they choose to play with, and they don’t owe him a position on the team, and that they don’t owe him anything*

So the angry extremist anti-Incel version of this would come along and say 

- that Barry is a loser, 
- he’s resentful and spiteful, 
- he is on a slippery slope to hating all football teams, 
- he has no right to be frustrated because the team does not owe him anything, 
- Barry is at risk of becoming radicalised, he will soon have urges to BURN down the football club and slaughter all of its members 
- he will want to join violent hate groups and crime groups to eradicate said football team. 
- Barry is a disgusting pig and should be shunned from society

Would you want to hear this if you were Barry? 

Where is the reality of the situation is that in 99.99999% of the cases Barry would probably, after voicing his concerns and frustrations and having a bit of a vent within some support group, would either just train so hard so as to become too good of a player to reject, or just move to a different town, or think of a different sport, or make friends with the manager in the team so he’s invited into the club, or just forget about the whole thing and live his life. 

I agree that there might be a degree of spectrum between a CV and an Incel, but *if we are defining an Incel to be someone who is despicable, feels people owe them sex, violently misogynistic and filled with hate and crime, then we cannot throw this word around to describe an innocent CV. This will ostracise, upset, infuriate, and ultimately risk radicalising a vast contingent of CVs who would otherwise I’ve just figured something out for themselves and moved on with life and found happiness and good relationships*

And just for the record, no I’m not an Incel. I am an ex-CV, who luckily managed to avoid all of this extreme Incel hunting witch burning rhetoric, and managed to get to a place where now I can have a fruitful and satisfying sex life. 
The only reason I’m mentioning that is because I don’t want people to come at me with personal attacks. 

The bottom line TLDR of this is it’s entirely possible to denounce Incels while also affording a degree of understanding and compassion and sympathy for the struggles and frustrations of innocent CVs who struggle to form sexual connections. The same way that you would afford sympathy to someone who can’t make friends, or someone who has no family, or someone who can’t sing, or someone who has no legs, or someone who can’t play football. 

Thank you."

This is what has I occurred  in CA. Chemical pregnancy termination is legal in CA and mifepristone in integral to the expedient, less painful completion of the procedure.
We are not talking about the refusal of two religious conservatives refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The consequences of a birth can be life long for the parent(s) and the child.

CMV: Inclusivity is an illusion of progress and is the destruction of excellence,"Oh boy, I know it's controversial, but this is how I feel. So I'd like some good counter-arguments.

Inclusivity is a destructive and misguided policy that has led to the degradation of our society and our values. The push for diversity and inclusivity has created an environment where individuals are judged not by their abilities or achievements, but by their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other irrelevant characteristics.

The promotion of inclusivity has led to the creation of quotas and affirmative action programs that discriminate against individuals who are not part of certain minority groups. This policy is not only unfair, but it also undermines the very principles of meritocracy and hard work that our society was built on.

In addition, the emphasis on inclusivity has led to the suppression of free speech and the stifling of dissenting opinions. Individuals who express opinions that are not in line with the current progressive narrative are often ostracized, cancelled, or even fired from their jobs. This is not the society that our forefathers envisioned, where individuals had the right to express their opinions without fear of retribution or persecution.

Moreover, the concept of inclusivity ignores the reality that individuals from different backgrounds may have vastly different values, beliefs, and cultural practices that may not align with each other. The push for inclusivity has created an environment where individuals are forced to accept and celebrate lifestyles and values that are not in line with their own. This is not only impractical but also impossible.

In conclusion, the promotion of inclusivity and diversity is a flawed and misguided policy that undermines the very fabric of our society. We must reject this policy and return to a system that values hard work, talent, and individual achievement, regardless of an individual's background or identity. Only by doing so can we restore the values and principles that made our society great."

CMV:Trans are Trans Because of gender stereotypes,[removed]
"cmv: MODERN Conservatives/Republicans (or whatever) are PRIMARILY a ""supremacy"" group.","Modern as in 2016 onwards, Not to be confused with pre-2016 conservatives. Most of the MODERN conservatives want to be (or feel) SUPERIOR to others. With key slogans and catch phrases such as ""Liberal tears,"" ""Lets Go Brandon (F*CK Joe Biden),"" ""Own the Libs,"" one asks, what are their key stances on such? So far, they are primarily focused on the ""cultural war."" Which means that people who fit into cultures, such as LGBTQ, gender, and race, will be under scrutiny.

During the 2020 election, sure the inflation and oil was an issue, BUT modern conservatives FAILED to CLEARLY propose SOLUTIONS to that problem, but focused on the ""culture war."" That ultimately costed them the election.

Currently, the biggest political issue is TRANS people. MTG had a sign that said ""Trust the Science."" NOW she believes science? Where was that energy during the COVID era? She is ONLY doing that because the goal of MODERN conservatism is ""superiority."" 

They need SOMEONE to ""feel"" superior to. And lets say they do pass anti-trans laws. Would they want to come together? Nope. Would they work for a compromise (although for issues like LGBTQ rights, there are NO compromises)? Nope. They would say ""Winner, winner, here's my prize. You are a loser who sits and cries.""

Examples of MODERN Conservatives would be:
- Trump
- Gates
- Boebert
- MTG
- DeSantis
- Abbot

Examples of TRADITIONAL Republicans would be
- McCain
- Romney
- Liz Cheney

Examples of GRIFTERS (follow the $$$ / votes)
- Shapiro
- Crowder
- Tucker Carlson
- Praeger
- 90% of conservative podcasts, TV personalities, vloggers, etc.
- Hawley (he deserves special mention)

For Hawley, he MIGHT be ""Modern,"" but he IS intelligent. He can easily switch back and forth. He is the most THREATENING to LGBTQs, females, non-whites, and non-Christians. If he becomes president, if he wanted to, he WILL make anyone who is NON white, male, Christian, straight feel subhuman."

CMV: The cliche of marriage being expensive is flat out wrong considering the value of combining resources,"It's been a common trope that marriage is expensive. jokes have been made about it on sitcoms, in cartoons, stand up comedy routines etc but that legitimately couldn't be further from the truth.

For nearly everyone the main expense they have is housing, for most people it consumes between 20 and 50% of their income. This really cannot be changed, especially in major cities where there is a very real lower limit to how much rooms, apartments, and houses cost, even in ""undesirable"" areas.

[Americans are increasingly burdened by rent](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-burden) and with skyrocketing housing costs for many it's the only way they can get housing.

But marriage, or a significant other you live with, is a big help to this on an individual level. Each partner cuts their rent expenses in half once they move in with each other, many stop needing roommates entirely because 2 people can live in a studio or one bedroom apartment. There are people who are able to live with multiple people in one bedroom apartments using bed sheets as walls, however, this is illegal in many jurisdictions due to zoning restrictions. 


With (roughly) twice the income, and twice the necessities, married couples often can better utilize buying in bulk, without worrying about food going bad prematurely, or that 18 pack of paper towels being enough to overdraw your bank account. This brings the cost per unit of necessities like groceries down as well. Buying in bulk has such a drastic effect on people's finances that it's been cited as a factor that [keeps poor families poor](https://www.wpr.org/study-low-income-households-miss-out-savings-because-they-cant-afford-buy-bulk)


I cannot think of anything that gets *more* expensive per person when one gets married, due to the simple fact that combining resources is so effective at reducing costs."
CMV: Taiwan is doomed. China's gonna invade it any time soon. Maybe it'll even lead to WW3,"I know this is a controversial and depressing topic, but I can’t help feeling hopeless about Taiwan’s future. China has been significantly ramping up its military pressure on Taiwan for years, especially in the past few months. And I'm starting to feel like it'll end up boiling down to two bitter choices: A, China basically does another Hong Kong but with more soldiers (you know, an invasion of some sorts) and succeeds, or B, countries like the US and Japan end up basically starting WW3 by rushing to Taiwan's aid, possibly involving nukes and stuff. Yeah, not pretty either way.

Some people say that China is just bluffing or testing Taiwan’s resolve, and that they don’t really want a war. Some doubt China's capability to carry out a meaningful invasion, maybe citing domestic issues. But I feel like these arguments largely come from wishful/magical thinking or denial of reality. [China has made it clear that it considers Taiwan as an integral part of its territory.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/china/china-taiwan-conflict-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html) I just can't see Taiwan standing their ground against the invaders, and I'm skeptical the US would want to intervene because, uh, nukes. Or maybe they will because they're the US.

And I feel like many people right now are so used to the status quo that they think it'll last for the rest of their lives, but that's certainly not happening. I wish I could be more optimistic; but especially considering the ""optimistic"" arguments concerning Russia vs. Ukraine I don’t see any evidence or reason to support that view."
CMV: Capitalism is the best economic system,"For the record, I'm not advocating for complete unregulated laissez-faire capitalism. I'm all in favor of certain things being public, such as education, health care, law enforcement, emergency services, roads and transportation, etc. I'm also in favor of regulations in order to do things like protect the environment, protect workers, etc. However, generally speaking, an economic system that is primarily characterized by private ownership, private property, profit driven businesses, etc. is the best economic system possible. To be clear, a lot of people seem to salivate over Scandinavian countries (like Denmark, for example), which are still capitalist countries. 

Obviously, capitalism has its flaws, but it is by far better than any alternative. Capitalism takes advantage of human nature and creates the proper incentives that facilitate the strongest economy. Compared to the alternatives, capitalism generally also results in better, higher quality, products. 

Compare that to the primary alternatives, which are socialism and communism. These systems have been complete failures every time they have been implemented. Some people argue that they failed due to Western influence, which is honestly just copium. These systems simply do not work because they don't mesh with human nature. Under these systems, the only result is poverty becoming much worse and more widespread, less overall production, and lower quality products being produced. 

I understand why a lot of people, usually young people, are disgruntled about capitalism, but what these people need to realize is that a lot of their complaints stem from the fact that life just kinda sucks in general. You can fantasize about a perfect idealized utopia all you want. It's simply never going to happen. Things like social hierarchy, economic scarcity, and human nature in general will always be the reality of life. Capitalism is the best we can do. Deal with it."

"CMV: For small countries locked in a rivalry with a superpower, it only makes sense for them to develop a nuclear program with strike capability.","What the US invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have shown is that world powers are capable of anything to enforce their political agendas. A sovereign country that is in bad relations with a world power must generate a nuclear program capable of attacking those world powers or their allies. It is the only life insurance that these countries have to ensure that they are not annihilated or become involved in a war that will destroy them economically.  

If Taiwan had the nuclear capacity to attack China, power relations and negotiations would be different, therefore the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons only favors world powers.  That can be applied to both North Korea and Iran currently."
CMV: Modern Feminism is No Longer About Equality,"To clarify before y'all come for my head, I absolutely support gender equality in every traditional sense. I'm pro choice, have had roughly the same number of guy and girl friends in my life, and fully believe that women are just as capable in every mental arena as men. That being said, what the fuck are we doing here?

More women than men attend college. Women can be doctors and lawyers and win the popular vote for President and nobody bats an eye. The wage gap exists on paper, but economists have debunked it repeatedly: women tend to choose less lucrative career paths more frequently and take more time off for family/personal reasons (men are also more likely to *seek* the high paid executive jobs and negotiate their salary when hired). This isn't the 1960s, nor is it the Middle East: to say women are held down by some phantom patriarchal force is both disrespectful to them and flat-out inaccurate.

Additionally, women also have certain societal advantages. They disproportionately win custody battles and do better in divorces. They have an easier time getting romantic attention (admittedly a double-edged sword, but still). They are allowed to display more emotion with less riducle. And more and more, they enjoy the social benefits of being from a ""marginalized"" group without much of the struggles faced by other such subsets (minorities, LGTBQ, disabled people etc.)

This really clicked for me when I tuned into ESPN tonight for some basketball and realized they were doing all-female broadcast teams for International Women's Day. I get it, it's a fine gesture, but the ESPN crew is essentially 50/50 gender-wise as is. Additionally, I'd be willing to bet that the network's viewership demographics are more along the lines of 80/20 male. In short, they are already an equal opportunity workplace in a sausage-dominanted field, but that clearly isn't enough for some people: I feel this is because the modern feminist wants to ""win"" a gender war more so than they want actual equality.

I have tremendous respect for first and second wave feminists (my own mother was the first female engineer at several different workplaces in the 1980s). I don't want to be a misogynist, but it feels like I'd be characterized as one by many in 2023. What am I missing about this third wave, and how can I correct my thinking?"
CMV: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a form of Ponzi scheme.,"Nuance: I believe the underlying blockchain technology has legitimate use cases, such as in healthcare. However, the hype around cryptocurrencies are reminiscent of Ponzi schemes. The conversation I hear around crypto evangelists is “why invest in crypto?” “Because you can make a lot of money!” The premise is that these profits are basically financed by new investors since the cryptocurrencies themselves don’t hold intrinsic value and can be issued at will. The promise of unbridled growth in profit, corresponding to an unlimited stream of new investors, is unrealistic and that’s why I get the impression that this is a Ponzi scheme that hasn’t imploded yet.

1. If we can prevent something very bad from happening without sacrificing anything of moral significance we are obliged to do it. His example is, you see a child drowning and you can save him but it will ruin your clothes. The cost of your clothing would not be of moral significance 

2. Famine, preventable illness, death etc. are very bad things

3. Organizations like unicef, against malaria foundation etc prevent the suffering described in premise 2

4. The luxury goods we buy on a daily basis are not of moral significance. I don’t need a cup of coffee in the morning, or a new shirt, or a new car if mine still works, or tickets to a sporting event etc. insert your favorite luxury item here

I would start with basic beliefs and use them to form a foundation for future posts going from there. 

Specifically outlining some basic rules:
1. Most axioms will be clearly listed
2. Specific claims will be clearly listed
3. If I add an axiom or change my reasoning, I have not changed my mind, but if any part of my claim needs to be modified, a delta will be rewarded.
4. All changes in my claims will be documented.


In replies to commenters, I plan to address as many arguments as possible and hold myself to these standards, and would articulate one of the following:
1. A specific logical or factual fallacy in their argument
2. How my worldview is incompatible with their premise.
3. Why their claim is contested information
4. That I don’t have enough information. In other words, I have not currently considered and/or researched this counterpoint. The comment seems to be true at first glance, but deeper research would be needed to confirm this was the case and change my mind.
5. An argument I have already made addresses your objections.
6. It changed my mind.

Claims(for this post): 
1. Future posts using these guidelines would be on topic and not violate any rules of CMV
2. This idea is either unlikely to be harmful to the CMV subreddit, or the benefits outweigh the potential harms
3. this is a good idea for me, considering these reasons
     A. I would find it fun
     B. It will help me consider any gaps or fallacies￼ in my reasoning and come to more informed conclusions
4. Using these posting guidelines is a “good enough” framework 

Definitions:
Axiom: I know this isn’t the actual definition of the word, but I would be defining an axiom to mean a viewpoint that I hold which should be assumed as true for discussion purposes and is either 1. A previous CMV of mine 2. necessary to the discussion but would derail the current topic  (in the near future I would post this CMV) 

Contested information: something in which the leading discourse does not agree on an answer or is guessing at the solution

“Good enough”: better than all other guidelines for my purposes or that I am aware of (this includes any framework which I have a 100% of learning in the future)

Tips
1. A mod reply refuting one or two is likely to change my mind
2. I think it is likely something about claim 4 is untrue, but I currently believe my guidelines are the best conclusions."

CMV: I think residential zoning is mostly unneeded.,"I’ve been a suburbanite my entire life and in most suburban places I’ve lived, there are clean(ish) lines between residential and commercial areas.


I think for the most part, it should be okay to build a residence anywhere. I do not believe the opposite when it comes to commercial property. 

A large developer or home builder are most likely aware of the negatives around high traffic areas. If they are okay with it, what’s the issue? If someone builds a house between a office building and strip mall, what’s the issue? If you have a house in the middle of a target parking lot where a fast food chain might be, what’s the issue?

Now if some land needs to be saved for something else down the road (like maybe a warehouse or something near some tracks), I can see something like that being a reason why. But as far as restrictions on well traveled areas visited by the public, I don’t see the issue.  

In cities, many people are doing that already. Living above or next to a restaurant. Across the street from an office building or gym. 

If someone is willing to ignore/accept the potential increase in crime, lack of interest in reselling and higher levels of traffic, let them."
"CMV: I don’t need to tell anyone I’m trans, not even my (future) partner","I wanna preface by saying this, my partner knows I’m trans, future partners probably will too but honestly they don’t need to.

Let’s start with a quote “I think they’re fine just don’t make it your entire personality,” in reference to trans women. So why is it when I don’t bring it up all the time it’s a problem so you wanna know just in moderation. Just the one, hey I’m trans by the way, then keep it goin, right. Thing is, why do I even have to tell you the one time?

There was an allegory for why and the person argued that, sure trans women are women right but if someone gave you a glass of lemonade and they replaced the salt with sugar, you’d want to know right? The problem with that is… Where’s the differentiation, argument 1 is biology, specifically chromosomes, swyer syndrome, from birth. That arguments dead. 

Okay argument 2, genitalia… Do I even have to explain that not all trans people keep their nether region. 

Argument 3 continuity, stronger but flimsy still, would you need to tell your partner you once had a lisp and went to speech therapy, no. It’ll come up in conversation I’m sure but like this isn’t “keeping secrets.” 

Okay but let’s say an alcoholic- has a 40-60% chance of relapse, detransition rates are at about 11% and drop down to 3% because 8% of this 11% threshold end up retransitioning,  about .5% of cis adults will transition and I have bad news for you but within my demographic, that jumps up to about 5% which means if you are dating me, you have about a 3% chance of me detransitioning which is lower than your 5% risked on someone in my age group. Also… Don’t even try it the testing isn’t bias they link both the method and crowd they used so continuity is a minor factor here. 

Argument 4 fertility, firstly we’re pretty close to trans women being able to give birth with implants and maybe “this’ll look just like bone marrow babies,” but even if we never can do realize cis women can be born without the ability to reproduce. 

Argument 5 you’re going to… Become a grave digger. By this I mean if you dig up my course it’ll come up male. It won’t. Estrogen and testosterone blockers are stronger than you think, the larynx won’t drop if you take it early your shoulder blades and whatnot won’t be prominent in a masculine way, not even your pelvis will reshape this has gotta be the dumbest “debunk”

Last one and tbf nobody’s arguing this with the lemonade one but the idea trans women aren’t women, the so called science you’d only ever call upon to break people down neurologically the idea. Psychology, neurology, even small levels of anatomy and biology prove trans women are women. The CT cortex visibly shows that trans women have closer brain patterns to cis women, if this were some grand delusion like schizophrenia we’d have smaller total brain volume, it’d be reflected in some way, it’s not.

Okay, so my 500 characters yeah? Why do I believe this? It’s important for my on safety, yes even in a relationship things can turn abusive. Plus why would I need to refer to myself and a trans women when calling myself a lesbian tells you everything you need to know, I should display my pride?  Lesbian flag. You don’t need the information that I am trans because there’s no differentiation between me and a cis woman. In a one night kinda situation I don’t need nor want to tell someone cuz there’s no strings attached, literally the entire point. When they are attached in a long term situation, romantic or platonic, unless it’s some kind of lie by omission or purposeful deceit there’s no issue there either. I don’t feel like I should have to bring up my past to plan my future! We’re supposed to be focused on evolving, growing together, if I brought up something from 10 years ago in an argument with my partner that hasn’t reoccurred in these 10 years, I’m crazy but the second I bring it up passively it’s “open-honesty,” like if I had a cat that died 10 years ago it’s not crazy to bring it up sure but it would be crazy to be forced into your partner. Let’s say it’s something more domestic having a long term affect over the beginning years of your life, trauma. Now yes telling you my trauma, that’s dope, love that, it’s cool. Thing is people trauma block and you just don’t need to know something that was only really a part of their childhood."

A well-written argument that argues that the animal has limited sentience or is a lower lifeform would make me CMV. Or maybe you could argue the pet would not survive if not for ownership. Another counterargument that could work is if certain animals such as dogs were bred to be owned."
"CMV: If the vow of consortium is violated for sex months straight, the vow of fidelity is automatically in abeyance","The vow of fidelity — usually phrased in wedding vows as “forsaking all others” — is considered very important, in Reddit and in most of modern Western society.

The vow of consortium — that is, of sexual consummation of the marriage, phrases as “to have and to hold” — is viewed a lot more loosely.

The other day, I was on a first (and last) date with a woman who got sloppy drunk and spent the whole time complain about how her ex cheated on her with some woman from his office.  I was mildly sympathetic to her, much as she got on my nerves, but then she happened to mention that she herself had not slept with the man for the three years previous.

I tried to gently suggest that she could have seen that coming, a suggestion that went over about as well as you guess, but later, I regret not calling her out on the injustice.

Yes, she was “tired from the kids” (she was a housewife) and “it happens to a lot of women” but... those things were not his fault.  If she was too tired for, or otherwise not interested in, sex, OK, she should not have sex, but she should also lose her place in line, so to speak.

There is no other kind of contract where one party is allowed to fail to observe the terms of the contract and the other party is not only not entitled to compensation but is barred from ameliorating the problems the breach causes.  It’s absurd.

Imagine if you paid in advance for a hotel room and then the room was not available, not only not getting your money back, but being required to sleep on the sidewalk outside instead of finding different lodgings.

Imagine if you went to a restaurant and denied food and not only did you still have to pay the bill, but you were not allowed to eat any food from another restaurant.  Forever.

Lots of contracts have a *force majeur* clause, so if one party breaches the contract owing to extraordinary circumstances, the penalty for noncompliance is lessened — but the other party is not held to the contract.

I picked six months arbitrarily, but if anyone has a better suggestion for the exact rule, I am happy to hear it.

If someone has a reason that he should have been obligated to celibacy, I will listen, maybe not happily, but with curiosity.

What I have **zero** interest in is “Why don’t they just get divorced?”  Even asking the question shows you have little grasp of the situation.  Look at what happened to the husband when the divorce did happen: he lost his house, he lost custody of his children, he has to live in crappy studio apartment in El Cerrito.

And all this happened in no-fault California, so even if you believe (absurdly, to my way of thinking) that he deserved those consequences, be aware that the infidelity was not admissible so even if he had gotten divorced right away, the end results would have been exactly the same."

CMV: i think veganism is dumb,"first of all, i understand being a vegan can impact the meat market because demand and supply. if more people refused to eat meat then there would be a decrease of slaughtering of animals because there is less demand. however, the demand for meat will always be higher then the diet of veganism. I know this because veganism isn' t an appealing diet, we need effective protein, and were suppose to eat meat because for thousands of years we've been doing that. it would be better to eat the meat so the animal doesn't die in vain in the first place. you could argue the animal dies because of the meat eater but i can also argue that veganism also kills animals and the environment as well. did you know that almond production of milk kills 50 billion bees alone? what about the transportation of produce in airplanes which releases thousands of CO2 which negatively effects the enviornment."

CMV: being an incel is somewhat pre-determined to an extent,"I say this because being an incel is a mindset, and the mind is the only thing you can control. I can voluntary choose to believe in something or not believe in something. The reason why I say this is because most incels are most likely undesirable men in the dating market. If you're ugly, short, fat, broke, you're more likely to hate women because you repel women since you're unattractive. Most incels are probably short, ugly, fat, broke. If you were 6'0, rich, handsome, you would probably not have a reason to hate women because women love you."
"CMV: Work should account for 25% of a person's day, not 33%","The agreed consensus is that work should be 33% of a person's day, being that daily life consists of 3 categories: Work, Leisure, and Rest.  Therefore it divides out to 33% Work, 33% Leisure, and 33% Rest...hence why the 8-hour work day is accepted.

However, a major ""category"" is left out of this formula: Daily Maintenance.  In this category the following activities would fall under: Bathing, Cooking, Shopping, and Cleaning.  These activities do not fall under Work, Leisure, or Rest.  And yet, these activities are a part of most people's daily life.

Therefore, it would only be accurate to incorporate this category into the formula of divided time: 25% Work, 25% Daily Maintenance, 25% Leisure, 25% Rest."
CMV: You owe an explanation to someone that you decide to remove from your life.,"If you met someone for the first time since a short period of time ago and you don't like them, its totally fine to ghost them with no explanation. Or, if someone is a toxic asshole, which they would obviously be aware of already, there is also no need to tell them. But besides that...

If you've had any kind of relationship with someone: romantic, friendship, family, coworker or whatever... and whatever the reason is, if you want to cut contact with someone, that is your own decision to make. But.. many people do this without even taking 5 seconds to give an short explanation. I believe this is toxic and wrong. Alot of people say ""no one owes you an explanation if they no longer want to communicate with you"" but I strongly disagree.

If you ghost someone without giving an explanation:

1. They might be overthinking ""did I do something wrong?"", ""what did I do wrong"", ""why does this person not wanna talk to me anymore is something wrong with me?"" etc..
2. If they did something wrong that caused you to cut them off your life, they might be unaware of what they did. For example if someone talks alot and is clingy, they might be totally unaware of it, and if this behavior annoys you, instead of suddenly ending the friendship by blocking them with no explanation, you could also \*communicate\*, something which many people apparently don't know how to do anymore. ""hey, you often do X and it bothers me"" isn't so hard to say. I have some online friends who are brutally honest with me, if I do something that bothers them they can get real mad, and guess what, these are the friendships that last the longest because these friends are honest and not immature to avoid communication.
3. They might simply be frustrated and curious to know why you made this decision. Its your own decision to make, but it does impact the other person, therefore you owe them an explanation. It isn't so hard to give a short explanation.
4. Its not cool to block/ghost someone who has invested their time and effort into the friendship/relationship. Not saying its wrong, if you need to leave someone, do it. But giving an explanation is the LEAST you can do to reduce the hurt feelings you are causing to the other person."
CMV: the fact that the term “incel” has now evolved to mean specifically a small sub group of involuntary celibates who are resentful and hateful etc - should have everyone enraged.,"Let’s be very clear. Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Meaning you are celibate (don’t have sex) and that it’s involuntary (meaning you didn’t choose to have it that way. You want to have sexual connections but for whatever reason can’t) 

So just today, chatting on a different post, I learned that incel now officially refers to a group of criminal hateful misogynists. Apparently so much so that many of them become school shooters and serial killers. 

So now I can’t use the term incel not knowing if I’m referring to some innocent dude who’s struggling to find sexual connection, or if I’m referring to a mass murderer who thinks they are owed sex or whatever. 

When did this transition happen? And why isn’t everyone up in arms about it? 

Isn’t it like saying black people are all violent gang members? Or Arabs are all terrorist. “Oh yeah Arab used to mean someone from the Arabian peninsula but yeah it’s evolved now. Now Arab means terrorist. It’s the same thing” 

This seems like a really dangerous path to go down. 

On a side note, I’ve never actually met an incel (evolved definition) in real life. But I do know dozens of incels (original definition) and they’re all pretty cool people. 

(PS I’m not an incel. I’m young and single and do very well in the dating scene. Even if you don’t believe me please just assume that it’s true because I don’t want this to turn into personal attacks against me rather than debating my point of view)."
"CMV: The average person is envious of those with higher intelligence, and the average person is arrogant, for the average person believes they are above average. Also, people view those with higher intelligence as arrogant when the average intelligent person is less arrogant than the average person.","It’s common for people to have disdain towards anyone who is notably more intelligent than they are, and in most cases, the people who accuse others of being fake intellectuals will say that about any genuinely intelligent person they come across, with said people never meeting a person which they can claim to like while, at the same time, being able to acknowledge that said person is notably more intelligent than they are.

I know that when many initially read the title of this post, they are going to immediately conjure up the image of the pseudo-intellectual neckbeard, so I’m going to establish certain viewpoints that I have in an attempt to curb said preconception. I find that intelligence, for the most part, comes down to genetics, and I do not think that people should be belittled or mocked for having deficits or limitations in certain areas of cognition, nor do I condone belittling people for lacking knowledge in certain areas. I am well aware that not everyone has access to the same opportunity, with many not having access to support at home or quality education, so my attitude is that as long as a person is respectful to others, treating others the way they want to be treated, they should be allotted an equal level of respect. My personal ethics and principles is that one should be allowed to partake in any sort of lifestyle that they choose as long as their lifestyle does not violate the well-being or human rights of others. Therefore, if one wishes to live a more relaxed and hedonistic lifestyle, they should be free to do so without shame or criticism.

To add more clarity, here are some pseudo-intellectual behaviors, or what many may brand as ‘fedora beard’ behavior, which I don’t condone:

* Correcting others trivial mistakes (acting like one is not susceptible to basic human error; hence, acting as if the only reason why one may flub their speech, confuse/misremember information, misplace an item, forget their keys, mistype something in a text, etc., can only be due to them being stupid and nothing more).
* Acting like others are stupid if they aren’t knowledgeable of random facts which they happen to know – the, “pfft, wow, how do you not know that,” flex.
* Bragging and/or obsessing over IQ, and doing so while not really understanding what is measured in an IQ test while ignoring the importance of its use in clinical psychology (once more, IQ is mainly genetic and it can be important in many clinical situations, so, consequently, a lot of ableism is exercised when people try to play the ‘my IQ versus your IQ’ game).
* Name-dropping: mentioning the names of famous/important people, or said peoples works, to flex, in a not-so-subtle manner, that their taste in media is above yours, with them pretty much leaching off of others success/accomplishments as a workaround to having no major success or accomplishments of their own.

Anyway, getting to the main point of my post, I find that people like to ignore the hard truth that some people are genuinely more intelligent than others, and that even though the science shows that anti-social, bigoted, and egocentric behavior is more pronounced in those who have lower intelligence, people tend to associate the previously mentioned negative traits with those who are legitimately intelligent. I find that there is an added layer of irony where those who tend to be the most hostile towards those who are noticeably more intelligent are more prone to engaging in the pseudo-intellectual behaviors that I’ve previously gone over.

The scientific research and academics conclude that those who are the least competent are much more prone to exaggerating their capability, and those who are more competent are more adept at recognizing their own limitations while being able to accurately assess their capability in different areas. The scientific term to describe this phenomena is the Dunning-Kruger Effect. The research also confirms that IQ has a lot of legitimacy, correlating with very consistent scores on tests that measure skills and traits that are not measured on an IQ test – this phenomenon is known as the G-factor. All the research continues to demonstrate that those with lower intelligence perform more poorly in areas such as Theory-of-mind and Metacognition – these are areas of thought associated with introspection as well as with understanding the dynamics of how other people's minds work, understanding how others psychology may differ or compare to their own. Similarly, those with lower intelligence tend to be worse at separating subjective schema from objective truth, with this, consequently, resulting in them being more intolerant towards what they may classify as ‘weird,’ not being able to recognize that the concept of what is ‘weird’ is not unequivocal, treating these more arbitrary and subjective concepts as being as easy to verify as an object's weight or a person's height.

However, even though the research verifies that those with higher intelligence are much more mindful of their own limitations and more adept at understanding others perspectives or situations, people still seem to act as if the reality is the opposite. I find that many people like to play the No True Scotsman mindgame to try to delegitimize those who may, to put it simply, just be a genuinely intelligent person. I’ll often see people play semantics with the term intelligence, inflating the term to the point where it, professionally or colloquially, has no practical use. I find that even when those can’t identify or highlight any specific actions or habits that they would consider to be ‘arrogant,’ they fallback on begging-the-question, repeating the same vague, empty, and nebulous claims while never providing any follow up. Conversely, it is easy to identify countless specific fouls that the other has committed which demonstrates arrogance on their end, thus, showing more behavior in accordance to the Dunning-Kruger Effect."
"CMV: The N-Word is NOT a term of endearment, therefore no one should really say it-and I'm African American myself. I can explain...","I was talking to some folks yesterday who is also ""black"", and she said it's okay for ""us"" to say it but not for ""white"" people. I was hit with arguments about how it's a term of endearment nowdays, and if you take off the hard ""r"" then it's okay and so forth. I disagreed, saying no one should really say it..Then they basically called me a ""do good"" negro who is an Uncle Tom- in my eyes, it's called having self-respect lol. 

I frankly think what they said is a bunch of boloney. To me, the word is offensive, since it's rooted in violent history of oppression and control. In my eyes, it's a great juxtaposition how you could stand to basically be called out of your name and essentially verbally abused by a complete stranger, so what if they look like me? Of all of the words in the English language, why can't we call ourselves more triumphant things- perhaps like King/Queen, genius, elite (just to name a few)..

**My thesis is simple:**  If the N-word is truly a term of endearment, then would you fight so hard to only hear it come from the mouths of folks who look like you? Wouldn't you want everyone to call you that if it feels so good? The word isn't affectionate, instead it's a slur that has been claimed as appropriate for certain cultures-which to me is a slippery slope for all sorts of issues."
CMV: Life is too hard to be worth it,"There are so many duties. To live life and don't be afraid that you won't have money for food, you have to learn skills and find good job.

CMV: Systemic racism doesn’t exist. The issues in the black community are entirely cultural.,"For systemic racism to exist that means that the system itself must uphold laws and values that are racist. As of 1964, thanks to the civil rights act, there are no laws which explicitly target any race harsher than any other race. Because of that, the system cannot be racist. If that were the case we wouldn’t have had a black president.

What is happening is individuals being racist. If politician is racist, that does not mean that the entirety of the American government is racist. Just because the dudes that founded the US (who founded it on principles of freedom from the British, not racism) owned slaves, that doesn’t mean that the country is white supremacists.

Systemic racism is a crutch used to justify certain people refusing to take personal responsibility for their poor life decisions and wanting to blame people who have been dead.

If systemic racism did affect black peoples then African immigrants would not outperform American black people. The issue is culture. Black Americans don’t particularly value education or hard work as much as say Latin Americans or Asian Americans so both groups, despite also facing racism outperform them. The same goes for African immigrants as those cultures value education more than blacks because it’s harder to get over there.

When a culture props up people like Cardi B, Lil Nas X, XXX Tentacion, and others as cultural icons, children look up to those people and want to be like them. So the have a lot of risky behavioral tendencies which leaves them having babies young, ditching their families, and ending up in jails 

It’s a repeating cultural cycle that can’t be solved by reparations as it’ll just end up in millions of new Jordan’s. The solution has to come from within and if they don’t want that, it won’t happen."

"CMV: I don't understand the inequality between men in women. I believe that, in the western world, most men and women are equal.","This subject about the two genders (men and women) is really interested. I would be interested in doing a masters in this subject. I'm always trying to understand it but it seems obscure and complicated.

I'm a straight ""white"" guy, meaning I'm not American, and I've never understood how women have it MUCH harder than men. I will explain my POV in an empiricism and statistics way.

**Experience:** In my experience, respectfully, I've never seen any inequality between those two genders. In the contrary, I've lived in a house where the man got mentally and physically abused. For illustrative purposes, my mom would scratch my dad with her nails, throw glass objects to us, scream, etc. My dad is no near perfection but he has a kind heart. My mom also has one, but she DEFINITELY needs ""heavy"" therapy. ""But, that's only one case. Not all women are like that"" Yes, obviously that's not what I'm trying to say. What I'm trying to say is, iIdon't see the inequality and that's why I have other EXPERIENCES that proves ME otherwise. two of my exes cheated on me. These are definitely not the best examples, but it just proves to me that men are women are just both humans, capable of doing good or bad. Yes, I know, good and bad is subjective depending on your cultures, societies, etc. Yes i know, but for me, cheating was a bad action and I think it's a universal ""bad"" action.

Which is caused by factors such as education and the job itself. Men are more likely to go into higher paying jobs.

So, what i'm trying to say here is not ""Bro, fuck feminist, we got issues"" but more of ""Hey, that's cool, but I've never seen a man cry in like ages. Are we actually tough or just ""oppresssed""??? I think it's amazing that we want both genders to be equal, because let's be real, we all have hearts, minds, cognitive functions, etc. We're the same but one has a banana and the other a hole. Not a big deal, really, so why ignore men issues and just focus on one gender?""

In summary, I may have skipped a few points, but what i'm trying to understand is, what inequality is there really? We both have our struggles so why make this one sided and not just understand and help each others?

CMV: we should no longer be considered the same type of human that existed before smartphones,"Change my view! I’ve been struggling with this for a while now. I can’t think of a single thing that we do that’s similar to how our grandparents experienced life. 

Things have changed on a fundamental level. Considering that evolution likely happens primarily due to external pressures in the environment, if we continue with this way of life, humans will surely turn into something else entirely. 

And that’s only if we haven’t already changed, given that a particular type of environment must have caused smartphones to emerge, which means we have likely already deviated  from humans that existed before smartphones, let alone humans that existed outside of civilization/specialization/domestication. 

Given that social norms, order, functionality, and mating rituals all revolve around intense and complex algorithms, modern human beings should no longer be considered the same as our ancestors. Even if we are genetically the same or similar, which we aren’t, due to proliferated diseases/illnesses, and disorders in the gene pool, our environment has changed so dramatically that I struggle to see how we are similar in any way."
"CMV: The suggestion that wokeism is a problem that needs immediate addressing because it is changing the fabric of our country, is more about fear than reality. The reality is that we have much more to fear from conservatives in government and how they are addressing this issue.","When watching the news, social media, or any kind of platform that people share their thoughts there is this prevailing sentiment that wokeism is a huge problem in our country and that something should be done about it.  You can find it everywhere. While I agree, it is an issue, it is not the severe problem that people think it is. There are constant conversations about protecting children from inappropriate conversations, sexual subject matter, and certain educational topics. These conversations are fair and should be had.  However, I feel what is missing in this conversation is the follow through that people have when addressing these topics. From what I have seen, there is a real push from liberals to fight for the rights of LGBTQ people and to fight for equality for everyone. However, when it comes to actually making a change through the law, these ""woke"" individuals haven't proposed much nor have they proposed anything that takes the rights of others away, in the United States. So while there are conversations about this subject, the changes that they want aren't on paper, so they are far less threatening than the actions conservatives in the law have implemented and voted for. I know people reference the the conversation that Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson had about the Canadian government forcing people to use the term that the individual would identify themselves. However, I have seen no equal being proposed, much less actually followed through with in a state or federal legislature in the US. However, we constantly see anti LGBTQ laws not only being proposed, but passed in a lot of states. For example, there are 34 bills in the Missouri legislature right now to ensure a trans kid can't play sports. There aren't enough trans people fighting for this right to even come close to justifying the existence of that many proposals to solve a problem that is rarely an issue. Many other states have banned things like drag story hour, which infringes on free speech. Obviously, I know that there are ""politics"" at play here, but the reality is that wokeism isn't a near the threat that people make it out to be. The real threat is how the conservative government is addressing this issue. If I am wrong, please change my view."

CMV: Stores that ask you to donate should pay taxes on it,"I get a look sometimes when I'm in a store from a cashier when I tell them no I do not want to round up and donate like I'm a jerk for not donating.  I was speaking to a cashier who didn't know that their major corporation they worked for simple uses that money as a write off and it's only to line their pockets.  I am not sure how many people know that but it's clear a lot of people don't since they donate anyway.  Sure it's easier to pay the store so they can donate, but what about the people who keep complaining the corporations are getting their pockets lined because of prices? Well this is the biggest scam in America IMO and apparently much of the public doesn't know that. 

If you are one of the people who donate through a store and yet you complain that execs are getting rich, you should know you are part of the problem.  The government should not allow this to happen, it is a short term feel good to the person who gives but it is a backhanded tactic to make the corporations look like they care.  THEY DON'T, they could have come up with a coupon system by the register or something but nope, they chose the high pressure make method of having the cashier ask you so you have to answer in front of the whole line of people.  All Executive/director level employees that take a bonus should go to jail for fraud. Part of that bonus money should have been paid in taxes.  Taxes are inescapable for everyone, they need to close this loophole. 

The only company I know that doesn't do that for tax reasons is Amazon, I don't like Amazon but I use them for convenience and price and I make sure to use the ""wish"" site so the local charity gets my donations.  They don't round up or anything, as far as I'm aware they straight take a % of the profit an donate it to the charity you choose. 

It grates on me that people are essentially unknowingly donating towards executives bonuses and then complain about it.  To me, when rounding up and donating to a charity it should be just that, it should not be able to be used as a write off to pay less taxes."

CMV: It's possible to live a fulfilling adult life without having children," I think this is going to be one most people here won't want to answer. I spend a lot of time on the Internet in places where people hold views antithetical to what I typically see on Reddit. The resounding sentiment in these places is that people, especially women, who don't have children past a certain point will end up frustrated, lonely, and unfulfilled. When I see this view being espoused it makes me a bit angry because I never really wanted kids, and I've been brought up to believe a person can find satisfaction in life through personal achievements. 

I’ve checked elsewhere online to find accounts of people who regret having children. Parents said they missed career opportunities, lost all their free time, took on tons of stress. But I found a recurring theme in these stories – that the parents loved their kids more than anything and wouldn’t trade them for the world. That doesn’t really sound like regret to me. 

One thing I don't think I can change my view on is that some people just aren't suited to have kids. But do those people deserve to be unfulfilled, then? For those of you who do believe having children is crucial, what is your solution to this?"
"CMV: As a Gun Control Method, Banning ""Assault Weapons"" Makes Little Sense","Let me begin by stating that I am in favor of most gun control policy ideas, at least the more mainstream ones (i.e., better background checks, registration, and banning guns that are more dangerous). 

However, many pro gun-control groups are pushing for another ""Assault Weapon"" ban, just like the one we used to have 20 years ago. In the 1994, there was a federal bill passed, and then sunsetted, that banned ""Assault Weapons,"" which included AR-15 style rifles, and most groups pushing for assault weapon bans seem to want to import the definition from this bill.

The bill in question banned the following rifles:

*Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and has two or more of the following:*

* *Folding or telescoping stock*
* *Pistol grip*
* *Bayonet mount*
* *Flash hider*
* *Grenade launcher*

The bill also banned some other forms of ""assault weapons,"" however this is the part of the bill that would apply to AR-15s. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is not with people saying that AR-15s should be banned, my problem is fact that this bill made no sense. 

On one hand, this definition allows to much. According to the bill, a gun can have a detachable magazine and a grenade launcher, but still not be considered an ""Assault Weapon."" I for one think that any gun with a grenade launcher is more dangerous than need be, regardless of if it has a pistol grip. 

On that note, this bill's definition also banned things that really have no bearing on how dangerous a gun is. For instance, why should a pistol grip matter? Or, why should a telescoping stock matter? I fail to see how adding a pistol grip to a gun makes it anymore dangerous. 

Basically, my problem with banning ""assault weapons"" is that it really doesn't change anything. Very dangerous guns are still able to slip through gaping loopholes and the guns that it does ban are not really any more dangerous than the ones that it does not. 

Also, conservative groups have pointed these facts out. While I tend to disagree with the NRA, they are very much correct when they say that a Semi-automatic gun with a pistol grip cannot do any more damages than one that has a traditional handle.  

For these reasons, I don't think that pro gun control groups should be pushing for another assault weapons ban. Or, at the very least, they should not be pushing for the same definition. Instead, they should focus on things that actually make guns more dangerous. For instance, a better definition would ban all guns with grenade launchers, but allow cosmetic changes, like pistol grips.  

Change my view."

CMV: We Should Alternate Between Political Systems,"It is the common thought that there exists one political ideal that society should strive to meet. Whether that be communism, capitalism, authoritarianism or libertarianism. However in all of these philosophies exist short comings which the other political systems pose as solutions to. Therefore it seems reasonable to me that we should operate on a cycle. We can have, say, a couple years of absolute capitalist development to spur the economy, but then after a fixed amount of time to fix income inequality we institute communism. Likewise socially we can have a year of monarchy to strengthen national bonds and then a year of anarchism to strengthen the individual. A year of patriarchy, a year of matriarchy, a year etc. 

How do we lay this out? In a constitution that sets down terms. How do we deal with people who become attached to any one particular system such that they’d want to stay there? Depending on the severity of the infringement anything ranging to prison to death (severity of course depending on if it’s an authoritarian retributive justice year or a libertarian rehabilitative justice year). 

TL;DR The best Realpolitik is actually in a continuously changing politic."

cmv: the debate around trans rights is often not about trans rights but about gender theory,"To start with the necessary mea culpas: I genuinely believe that trans people should be able to live lives of dignity and authenticity, including full transition and legal acceptance. Further, I don't view their identity as unethical, immoral, destructive, or any other culture war style opinion. I fully support their right to life and expression.

That said: I spend a good bit of time around contentious topics in general. I like philosophy and politics and these topics are where the edges are hashed out. Reading these frequent related threads, listening to podcasts, and irl discussion have led me to believe that this issue is two pronged.

The first is imo simple bigotry and the endless battle for acceptance and station that humans seem doomed to. On this front I am aligned entirely with trans people.

The second is conceptualization of gender itself. Some number of trans people report an innate experience of self. This innate self is gendered. A common belief is also that gender is entirely constructed ie physicality dictates no part of it. These two thoughts seem incongruent to me.

An example of a once touted case was a Canadian child who by way of botched circumcision lost his penis and was raised as a girl. This person was studied for some time. Who conducted the study essentially touted this as more or less proof of the malleability of gender. The child questioned their gender in their teens, felt as a man, and later killed himself some time after learning the truth of it all. This occurred well after his case was used as an example of the truth of our modern conceptualization of gender.

The example is meant to demonstrate this: if gender is entirely constructed, how can anyone (trans or cis) have an innate sense of their gender? In a small sample study I read years ago, around 40% of the trans participants reported an innate experience of a gendered self. Were those people lying or misunderstood?

This whole debate drives me a bit up the wall. It feels like if I don't call loads of trans people liars, then I'll be accused of calling loads of trans people liars. I think this stems from an incoherent view of gender.

I am open to changing my mind. I appreciate any feedback."
CMV: Most people who use and make their whole personality around gender and what to be called is doing it for attention,"So as the title says. I belive that people who make up a bunch of genders and go online is not actually feeling this, and have a hard time being missgendered irl. I see it as they are in 99% of cases just despereate for attention and just want to feel like they are not just a sack of flesh who can think and are worth nothing in the spectreum of human life. 

This is not meant to be transphobic and all that shit, i have my own beliefs and tbh,do i believe all the things people talks about when it comes to this? No, i feel like its gotten out of and. But i someone wants me to call them A, B or C dosent affect me on a personal level and i will do that. 

So if you come here to spread transphobic propaganda, this is not it. I want Trans people and knowledeable people  to help me understand this entire thing. 

HAve we gone to far with being trans? Have we not gone far enough? So many questions. So few honest, not hateful answers.

CMV: Capitalism is a façade," I don't know why I bother voicing opinions on the internet because everyone is stupid, and I am also using the internet which is ironic. Great start huh?

I just recently got out of school, after dropping out and was tired of working barely above minimum wage to be plunged into a nearly 60 hour a week work load as a public accountant doing mind numbing tasks in hopes of building up my portfolio and to get a ""better job"". What a pitiful existence. Life experience, time spent socializing gone, each day indistinguishable from another and in a blink of an eye it's been 3 months. It has only just hit me that I'm in a trance of acceptance, that this is my life now.

The world needs a centralized government that just controls everything and just say fuck it. The hivemind is too stupid to have a voice, just look at what garbage we consume in media. Some form of Communism is required for progress to move forward for mankind. Capitalism is holding back innovation because the 0.001% has the government by the balls because if they stop churning money then the economy will collapse. If the argument is that a centralized government would infringe on human rights and free will, they're delusional to think that we're not already slaves to something in the system we live in, whether it's money or what have you. Free will is a construct that only is relevant when your voice holds no relevancy, but when you do hold power you'd be silenced if it goes against the narrative. Which is why you can say whatever crazy shit you want in the US because everyone and their grandmother does it anyways, but if you do it in China, you'd be blinked out of existence because you're an anomaly that can spark a chain reaction

I've always thought growing up that the whole idea of progress in society is to live in a world where we didn't have to work, and I say work as in something that you deem as a ""job"". You can contribute to society greatly with your passion and the title of your activity wouldn't be called a job and the act of doing wouldn't be called working, but that can't be a reality for the overwhelming majority in the system we live in. We as a whole have grown distant, miserable, and cold to one another and hyper focused on our careers to fight a losing battle as the cost of living and wages disparity becomes greater each year.

We are here shitting our pants that we'd lose our jobs in the future due to automation, when in reality millions of jobs across the globe, if not billions could be replaced this very moment if we used our current resources to move in said direction. But we can't have that, because people like Elon Musk can't throw billions of dollars around to buy a company he has no idea how to run because he's ego tripping like he's the second coming of Christ that'll drive mankind forward because he has a lot of zeros in his bank account. Oh yeah did I mention there's children and babies dying while he's literally burning money."
CMV: Schools should pay you for good grades,"A little prelude to how I remember my school life in my country (Germany):

1. Oral participation was just as important as tests/exams. Meaning, 50% of your grade was determined by your participation in class, inlcuding answering teacher's questions, presenting your homework, volunteering for tasks...
2. We had quarter-yearly reports on our grades within a single school year, which we could use as a standard for payouts.

The most obvious benefit is that students will pay more attention in class to get their financial compensation. A lot of young children don't even get allowance from their parents, most teenagers all the way to high schools don't work any jobs.

Another, albeit less obvious benefit is that we're teaching students how to be financially responsible at a young age. This ties in to the second sentence of my previous point.

I can give an example model of how this could look like:

1. Students, when enrolled to middle school, are taught about the model, rewards, and the such, so that they're motivated right as they get in.
2. Both oral participation and tests flow in equal measures towards your grade.
3. At the end of a quarter, schools write a quarterly report and immediately hand out money associated with the grade. The conversion from grade to money is explicitly shown.
4. Example, C -&gt; $1, B -&gt; $5, A -&gt; $10, A+ -&gt; $20. These numbers can or should probably be adjusted from school to school, depending on local climate and how well it is receieved.

The grades aren't attached to a specific grade of a test or anything, it's the combination of both oral participation and written tests that build up to your final grade on your school year certificate.

There are some ideas here that I'm not entierly married to. We can probably adjust the rate at which payouts are given, and the exact amounts in $ can be quibbled over."

CMV:Contemporary mainstream Films lack a central creative vision because too many people are involved in making them,"If anyone has heard of the  parable of the blind men and an elephant it is a story of a group of blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and imagine what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective knowledge.

So. How does this apply to filmmaking? Well. For starters they're increasingly not written by a person, but a committee. There are also notoriously a number of boxes to check. And each person is looking at a very specific aspect of the story that they think is the most important. While ignoring an overreaching central vision. Since films are consumed by one person, these disparate views create films which are flat and predictable.

Another contributing factor is that filmmaking has become more democratic. A Kubrick film looked like a Kubrick film. A Tarantino movie the same. Now a James Cameron film just looks like... What? To me its just pandering to the lowest common denominator and you can no longer see the hand of the director in the work. Now. There are exceptions of course. Todd Phillips Joker would be one of them. But, it's also worth noting this was a low budget film. Costing around 55 million to make. But grossing over a billion. Why? I'd say a large part is due to the fact that Phillips vision shaped the film into something of his own and audiences crave that. However taking a risk on a small budget film like this isn't a sure thing for investors, so they're more likely to just put their money on avengers and be assured they can get it back."

"CMV: if you have children today, you quietly acknowledge they’re gonna have it worse than you during their lifetime, being burdened with huge adjustment and survival costs in terms of both their individual health, as well as financial and societal.","Is there a moral reason to give birth today? 

I personally wouldn’t even assume they get to experience adult life in a democracy still.
De-carbonization is just the easiest attainable goal without having to make secessions to consumerist lifestyle. 
But the damage done has already set off effects we don’t see yet but are not avoidable anymore either while still being prisoners to the way we organize human life, the structural dependencies of food chains, (I.e. destroying nature to feed many), etc. 
Democracies do not seem viable in the long run because they rely on consumerism and the promise of wealth, the basis for both of which it undermines by externalization of real cost. 
I believe the scarcity that our children are likely to face will drive them to destroy the democracies by vote once it simply can’t deliver good enough organization of life anymore because the material means have run out to feed the voting majority. 
Not to mention the mental health burden of living in such a structurally sui*dal mess."
CMV: Arguing Points against Loli Hentai,[removed]
"CMV: The Willow Project is bad for America, and the world even.","Counterclaim 1: It’s a small amount of oil.
The United States produced about 4.9 billion carbon, this project would produce about 200 million over the span of 30 years, even with the benefit of the doubt 200/4 would still be 0.05 over 30 years that’s what 0.001, such a minuscule percentage of c02 emission if anything they’re being conservative with the amount. 

Problem 1: The location
Alaska’s ice is already melting and it’s absorbed a lot of percent to put it into perspective [iffy source backing this percentage] that’s about 3% of the nations c02 emission already, which is a huge number and the exact place of this is in northern Alaska. So this is seeking to melt ice caps that just… Weren’t at jeopardy before. 

Problem 2: The precedent
First, this sets a precedent. Secondly, there is already a precedent for what happens when we neglect c02 absorbers like the Amazon rainforest, as a result mass destruction and and wild fires occurred. Solely because we didn’t treat this right. The rainforest in Alaska absorbs about 40% of the nations c02, now to be fair this is again northern Alaska and the forest is in southern Alaska but as far as I can tell whilst it wouldn’t likely reach the forest, there’s a possibility it does and that flips a minuscule percent like 0.001 to maybe 3% maybe 43% it’d go up to at least a billion more. Like if it were direct guaranteeable, solidified damage in the millions sure but it’s AoE is larger than it and I don’t see how even risking a billion yearly is worth it in the long run. 

Problem 3: Things are bad
An argument I heard is that LA produces so much but the entire thing is the California wildfires roar there, if the number 4.9 billion yearly was proven to not have an effect sure this’d be *maybe* worth a risk but the world is already on fire, no matter how small the number may be, this giant number we’re comparing is already proving to have negative affects on the world, no matter how much fuel you add to the fire 0.001 or 43% when there’s is a fire, you just don’t add to it.

Counter claim 2: Payout
Unless there’s a payout, there is a reason, let’s say your friend put 20$ on it, then would you do it, is it worth it, small risk, high reward. A number like 1.5% of the nation is much higher than 0.001% and much more concrete than a potential 3-43%. I love the internet, I need to drive places, and I can’t stand the cold. More oil ensures that it’s easier for me to access these things. I think we all deep down get sad knowing there’s people who are stuck out in the cold and really if the number of these people go down we all get a little less sad. 

Thing is… Even low balling with the 3 alone, yeah I wanna be warm but I don’t wanna be on fire. Neither does our world. I just don’t see the pros of this project outweighing the cons."

There's maybe 2 dozen games on my wishlist that I won't go near because they still have that ""Early Access"" tag and have been ranging anywhere from a few months to 6 years.

Recently, I've decided to expand this rule to not getting *any* game until I have a chance to read its reviews 48 hours in. The reason being the games I'd been looking forward to: Victoria, Darktide, Company of Heroes 3, Blood Bowl 3, have all come out and were excoriated for being unfinished, poorly balanced and buggy. So why bother buying a game on release any more? As it stands I made the mistake of buying Darktide out of the gate but for the others I think the best play is to wait several months or a year until they've been fixed and I can buy them on sale.

If you take the opposite hormones of your biological sex do you think this is linked to mental health issues within the trans community?

I don’t understand how it wouldn’t because you would still be a man or woman, taking hormones your body isn’t naturally supposed to have.

CMV: It’s not wrong to glorify historical people despite their immoral deeds.,"Is it wrong to admire past great men just because their actions were violent or disliked by others in modern times? My view is no it’s not wrong, I do it to some of my favorite historical figures. But I’ve heard people say this reflects badly on who I am.

Here’s some context. I recently got into an argument that often happens when praising historically great men. Being a fan of Hannibal Barca (the Carthaginian general), I retroactively admire his war against Rome. And in particular I said I was somewhat happy and felt it justified that Rome was eventually destroyed (pillaged) hundreds of years later as retribution for Hannibal’s loss. However, someone responded saying that it was wrong to praise the violence incurred on a city just b/c of my admiration for a once enemy of that city.

In another example, I once made a post about Julius Caesar, praising him as a great polymath (which he was) and significant person. But people, admittedly truthfully, pointed out his brutal violence against innocent people, his sexual deviance, etc… and that he is not worthy of praise. And so praising figures that one would obviously not want to emulate today is a wrong thing to do.

I can’t argue that these past figures didn’t do bad things, but I still admire and glorify these  individuals regardless. Does that mean I’m wrong and this reflects badly on my character (and anyone who does a similar thing)? I don’t think so, but I want to get to the bottom of this."
CMV: Fashion industry should include models of all shapes and sizes,"Now that Victoria's Secret is making a comeback, there has a lot of discourse over slim, lean women being the predominant type on high fashion runways. Because this type doesn't represent the average woman and is for some an unattainable goal, it causes many women to feel bad about themselves.    
High fashions and haute couture shows should be relatable and make everybody feel better about themselves. If an online fast fashion store can show women of all sizes and shapes, why can't high fashion? Especially when women of different sizes can see how would the clothes look on them!  
There should be a variety of plus size models, petite plus size models, dwarf models, handicapped models etc. The current look is so uniform and it's boring.

We could end almost all political, racial, and gender based division in this country if we stopped using words pejoratively and if we stopped taking offense. We need to stop putting hate behind our words and also stopped taking offense every time someone uses a word we deem offensive regardless of intent this world would be a lot happier.

Provide reasons that normal terms that are currently considered offensive should be offensive. Excluding race, gender, or sexuality based terms that were created out of hate like the N word and f*gg*t (typing that out made me feel sick, but I couldn’t just say the F word) because there are no ways to use them other than pejoratively.

I believe colonization left a horrible stain on Indigenous/Colinzied people's culture and even lives,I believe that in the past,colonization had horrible affects on the people who didn't ask to be invaded,however I cannot help but notice that countries like Jamaica and Ethiopia were significantly more developed and had more laws,especially those that target crimes against individuals,being enforced,under colonization.I cannot understand why gaining complete independence and authority over oneself triumphs that of a developed infrastructure and high human rights index,while still remaining semi autonomous and having local Goverments.Realistically Jamaica,Ethiopia,and other colonized nations had discrimination against the colonized peoples,but today with the exposure of social media and cameras,this discrimination would drop drastically


To summarize, I believe certain colonized countries would be better off staying under their colonial authority because of

1. Better infrastructure and development 
2.Higher Human rights index and crime enforcement 
3.Combined economic force of a colonial power and a resource filled colony would create a very beneficial market for those countries."

cmv: Most protests are undemocratic,"This applies only to liberal democracies, not to protests against authoritarian governments, such as those currently taking place in Iran.

But if the reason why you are protesting is popular with the majority of the population then there should be no need for a protest. As an example, French air traffic controller and railway worker tend to strike more compared to those of other European nations. They usually demand better salaries. 

If their demands were democratic (backed by the majority) there should be no need for them to protest, since politicians would agree to their demands without a strike. 

As another example, since many 16 year old want the right to vote, what would be more ""democratic"":

-That they wait until the majority of the electorate support a Congress that passes a Law that lowers the voting age? Or votes for a referendum that lowers the voting age?

- Or that the nations sixteen and seventeen year old protest in front of Congress until their demand is met?"

CMV: ALL the Yakuza games have bad combat,"I've been exploring subreddits, videos, reviews of the Yakuza franchise and one thing I see people praise is the combat (except 3 because of enemies stunlocking the player). But I'm sorry, the world building, story, characters, environment, side stories are all great but I just can not get behind the idea that the combat is great

Reason 1: No Telegraph

Let's take Dark Souls for example now I know you are already gonna go ""their different games stop comparing!"". I think the Dark Souls (for the most part) perfected fair combat and I want to use it as an example so stop complaining and listen. Usually when you die in Dark Souls, it's your fault not the ai. That's what is so appealing about dark souls is because you actually learn to evade enemies, attack at the right time, use strategy to win. In Yakuza, bosses give like 3 frames MAX per attack basically guaranteeing damage and when you attack back they can dodge, block, counter with ease. To me, as someone who doesn't use Adderall, monster energy and rise pre workout to play a fighting game, can't see that bullshit and people will always respond with skill issue even to someone who has 700+ hours across the whole series because they refuse to think a game that hasn't changed it's combat system since the PS2 version is outdated

Reason 2: I don't care if you hit me with a chainsaw, I have I Frames while standing completely still

In dark souls, enemies get I Frames just like you and both you and the bosses have a fair amount of I Frames. Usually most bosses get I Frames during critical hits or dodges and since they have limited stamina, they can only dodge so much just like you. In Yakuza however, some of the main story bosses and any side story bosses will break that fairness in half over it's knee. The enemies can freely block all the damn time with forearms of steel but when you try and block it's broken in 3 light attacks and your dead. They will get I Frames from standing still and when you are out of punching reach the enemy magnet towards you and guarantee a hit. I'm sorry, but if you have guaranteed hits in your game, that's bad game design and artificial difficulty.

Reason 3: The only way to win is Cheese

Once you have given up and become mentally exhausted, you probably found a way to cheese the fight using heat actions (especially bad in Yakuza Kiwami 2). Now yes Dark Souls did have cheese, but most of the time the bosses you fight really have to push you over the line before you make that choice and sometimes getting the cheesy weapon is sometimes even harder than the boss itself. But in Yakuza, it's just XXY, Heat Action, Repeat but if the enemy has bullshit I Frames, just pull out a weapon and repeatedly use Heat Actions and Stamina Royal to win. That's not even taking to account fucking tiger drop. I'm sorry but if the combat is made to be cheesed, that's bad game design

I love Yakuza but holy shit is the combat exhausting and makes me want to quit the series. I'm trying really hard to find what's so great about it that people praise it but the only thing I see is the over the top heat actions you will see 500+ times over the series because SEGA reuse so many assets you'd be convinced their running a money laundering scheme.

If someone could please help me understand, I am willing to listen but holy shit is this bad"

So they should have a mandatory testing for mental illness and if they find out that they are a pedophile or a psychopath then they should give them disability benefits along with free therapy and free counselling and sheltered workshop social enterprise jobs for pedophiles and psychopaths that don’t involve people so that some of them can’t offend. Also being a psychopath doesn’t make you evil since it’s a condition only actions make you evil. There are non offending pedophiles who are not evil. Offending pedophiles are bad.

"CMV: If you’re Overseas Chinese with heritage from the Mainland, there’s very little reason to visit Taiwan instead of the mainland","I’m a Chinese person living in America. My parents are from Mainland China and I have some relatives there. I’ve visited China several times and I enjoyed it a lot. It’s a great way for me to learn about my “home” culture, history, language, and people, and forging vital connections to my roots and identity.

I’ve never been to Taiwan, but I don’t see why I should go there instead of China. Taiwan simply doesn’t seem to have much to offer that China doesn’t have already - or even better things. Why go to the Taipei 101 when the Shanghai Tower or the Shenzhen Ping’an Financial Center are taller? What’s the appeal in Sun Moon Lake when Jiuzhaigou is much more scenic and colorful? And isn’t most of “Taiwanese cuisine” just ripped off of Fujian’s and Guangdong’s? China has more culture, more history, more development, more opportunities, and more relevance than Taiwan. Taiwan is just a minor offshoot of Chinese civilization that has been influenced by foreign powers like Japan and the US.

Now, I do admit, I’ve heard defensive apologetic arguments from certain Taiwanese, saying that “Come to Taiwan because Taiwan is where all the *real* Chinese culture survives and thrives, since we didn’t have Communism or a Cultural Revolution etc., and overall everything’s more free.” And I have to ask, don’t these arguments honestly sound more politically motivated than anything? Culture evolves over time and varies widely across different regions, and is not set in stone.

As for the censorship issue and so on, it’s honestly overblown, and as long as you don’t get too involved in the local politics or directly insult the government, tourists should be fine. And yes, the Internet is fairly highly restricted, and not everybody might want to use WeChat or Baidu, but even so… You're going there to experience the real China and its rich and diverse culture, not to surf the web all day. You can use local sources or talk to people directly. And for all the horror stories people tend to highlight about controversial acts the Mao and the Communists might have done in the PRC, it’s definitely worth mentioning that Chiang and ROC aren’t exactly squeaky-clean either. Yellow River Flood, 228 Incident, White Terror… Deng Xiaoping started opening up in the 1970s, while Taiwan remained under martial law all the way until 1987.

But I digress (and this shouldn’t be a political debate and I don’t want it to turn into one). To be clear, I don’t mean to sound like I’ve anything specifically against anyone from Taiwan or who likes Taiwan. It’s a nice place with nice people. It doesn’t “suck”, and I’m skeptical of the Mainlanders who say stuff like “Taiwanese people are nasty towards Mainlanders, especially southern Taiwanese”. But considering I’m an Overseas Chinese with plenty of heritage from one China and none from the other, I don’t see any compelling reason to visit the other China instead of, you know, China.

CMV: Social media having likes and dislike systems are a way to make people sell out their honesty for the appeal of the public. All while enhancing negative behavior to keep people hooked on apps.,"Ever since these systems were introduced all it ever did was create people who are looking to join a crowd for public cheering. Reddit is at fault for this too. The entire upvote and downvote system is completely unnecessary and heavily influences what people say or don't feel safe enough to say. Not to mention is creates a crowd where one crowd jumps on a sole individual who simply states a factual statement. I'll most commonly use posts seeking advice as an example. More often than one person gives advice based on factual info and data. While you get a crowd who prioritizes their feelings or the social media trend they were taught. Very easily over downvotes it creates motivation for others who just joined on the topic to jump on the only factual person in the comment section. All because we live in a society that can't handle the truth and crowding up on someone makes you more right than factual studies. This is where people are sleeping on the true purposes of these systems. When you go on and a simple factual statement creates drama with one rational side vs the defenders of feelings all these people went from browsing through the app to now going on a debate for hours on a social media page. All while these apps are getting flooded with money through ads. The highest community involvements participate in today is literally social media drama. Even celebs on twitter are the exception. What happens when celebrities get into drama? Everyone stays tuned for the back and forth tweets all day. The likes and dislikes create crowds and now you two different crowds continuing to grow based on likes and dislikes. Everyone identifying who's on their team or what team they're joining based on likes and dislikes. All this does is prevent common ground discussions where people are able to be informed and have a change of an opinion. You give someone 1,5k upvotes on a comment based on feelings now they can never take a step back and accept they're wrong. Now the pressure is on them to hold onto that online team for another dopamine rush of people taking their side. It creates a false sense of pride. Studies have shown that even 1 like on social media can cause a rush of dopamine. Everyone claims to hate the rich, but they must love the ones who are investors of social media apps because that's who really wins when people get engaged in a social media page algorithm and spend the entire day arguing feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with these systems is it encourages bullying and other sorts of negative behavior. You take someone who was invisible in their everyday life and all they do is see the possibility of gaining spotlight online by being a bully online to those with different views. All for the cheer of the public. They become online who they hates in their daily lives for making them invisible or overshadowing them. The likes and dislike system along with algorithms is the reason we have a society faking mental health issues, health issues, false advocating for shit they don't care for but are profiting off of. There will always be too many people who do care about this stuff. Some will bluntly point out someone's downvotes as a reason to why they're wrong. Which is total bs in itself. There will always be those who care for trophy hunting, karma hunting, their profile must look like a politician who obviously has the popular vote. Society has now lost its integrity to simply be honest. It's say what they want to hear and not what they need to because at the end of the day I sit with my high karma profile while this person believes my upvote hunting comment and sets themselves up to lose in their daily life. When people complain about getting the same unhelpful rehearsed responses on subs this is why. Because we have rehearsed comments copy and pasted guaranteed to gain karma."
CMV: People should be able to apply for citizenship if they live in a country and they can speak it's language properly.,"To give a little background information, there are a bunch of countries where you need more. Usually, in addition to fluently speak their language, live and work there, you need some sort of historical tie to that country. One of your ancestorn being from that country is the most common example. In most of these cases, you can also apply if you marry a citizen.

And this is just silly. People living, working there, filing their taxes there and yet they are not citizens. And not being a citizen comes with various disadvantages for no real reason. It gets so stupid in some countries that an immigrant family's childrend can't get citizenship, even if they were born in that country.

In conclusion, this is how it should work: If you lived in a country for a certain amount of time (different for each country depending on circumstances), pay taxes there, and speak their language, you can attempt the citizenship test.

"cmv: The existing ""welfare system"" in Europe is wrong, and every other country in the world should turn into America, especially Canada","I know that many people are complaining that ""the welfare system in the United States is not as good as that in European countries"". However, I must tell you, especially Americans, that the current American society is the most perfect social model, and it is Europe, not the United States, that should make changes.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Europe's ""welfare system"" is nothing more than raising lazy people. Let's look at the fact that Tom graduated from Trinity College (a famous university in Europe), and Jack graduated from some unknown high school (meaning he didn't go to university). Years later, Jack worked as a waiter in a restaurant in Dublin, earning 40k euros a year. And Tom works in an IT company in Dublin, and his annual income is 60K euros.

&amp;#x200B;

So, have you found out? As a graduate of a prestigious school, Tom's income is only 20K euros higher than Jack's! Jack didn't even go to college! This is very unfair. But in fact, not only Ireland, such a phenomenon exists everywhere in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, what if Tom graduated from Stanford and works in Silicon Valley, while Jack works at a restaurant in California? Then I can tell you that Tom's annual income will be $200k, while jack may only have $40K. This is a fair and reasonable society. Obviously, this is why the United States became a superpower. Because in America, everyone has to get everything they want with their own hands.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The European ""welfare system"" is very bloated and inefficient. I don't want to say too much about this, you just have to look at the UK healthcare system and ask Canadians how long they have to wait in line to see a doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, in the United States, you can find a doctor very quickly. Sure, you'll probably spend more, but that's nothing compared to American incomes.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I really don't understand why Canada would go down a wrong path even though Canada and the United States are neighbors? I hope Canada can learn from the United States and embark on the right path.

&amp;#x200B;

4. As for other developing countries, the United States is of course a model for you to learn from. After all, the United States has a very high per capita GDP and living standards."

CMV: It makes sense to judge people for promiscuity and to judge women for it more than men,"If I hear that someone has had an excessive number of sexual partners, yes I am going to judge them for it and think less of them for it and I will apply this more to women than men. I don't think this is bad or misogynistic.

Having sex is inherently risky behavior even when using ""safe"" sex methods. Every time someone has a new partner they are taking some risk of getting permanent, life-changing diseases. They are taking some risk of either getting pregnant themselves or getting someone else pregnant (for heterosexual encounters). And going home with strangers all the time carries some risk of being raped, assaulted, robbed, or murdered. The only reward for taking these risks is pleasure so in this way I view promiscuity similarly to other risky behaviors like gambling or impulsive shoplifiting. I will conclude that people who engage in it lack self-control and the ability to consider the consequences of their actions. While this does not make them inherently bad people, it means they are likely not people I want to be friends with or in a relationship with, and I don't see anything wrong with this. Judging others on some level is absolutely necessary even though it does have negative effects.

As for why I judge women more, it's because all the risks I mentioned affect them more. Many STDs have more severe symptoms in women, pregnancy is a much greater burden than getting someone else pregnant, and women are more vulnerable to being attacked by their partner. Therefore a woman who has had a certain number of sexual partners has taken even more risk than a man who has had that same number.

Two caveats to this: some people have a genuine addiction but I think this is a small proportion of promiscuous people so I assume it is not the case. And people having sex with others of the same sex are taking less of a risk, but they are still taking risk. In this case, promiscuous homosexual women are only slightly more risk-taking than promiscuous homosexual men.

I don't see this as misogynistic because it comes from real differences between men and women and not some kind of stereotype or bias I have. But since this is considered an old-fashioned view that is discouraged by many people nowadays, I want to know if there's something wrong with it so I am posting here.

CMV: it’s better to be asexual than to be straight if you strictly interpret the Bible from a traditional conservative perspective.,"From a very conservative and strict interpretation of the Bible, isn’t it better for a Christian to be asexual rather than straight?

If you interpret the Bible very strictly and from a traditional conservative perspective, you’ve see that it’s easier for asexuals to follow the Bible than straight people.

Firstly, the Bible prohibits many forms of sexual activity. While having sex with the same gender is prohibited, there are also many other forms of sexual activity prohibited in the Bible. For some strange reason, most Christians tend to only focus on the Bible’s prohibition of homosexual sex, and ignore the other forms of sex prohibited in the Bible such as pedophilia, but that’s a whole different story.
Anyways, back to topic
Having premarital or extramarital sex is prohibited, having sex with a condom is prohibited, having sex purely for pleasure is prohibited.

The only sex allowed in the Bible is sex between a married male-and-female couple with the intent to bear children, at least that’s how traditional conservative Christian’s interpret the Bible.

Well, in that case, isn’t it much better to be asexual?

Now, I can’t speak for all asexuals but based on my experience with asexual people, it seems like most asexual people feel romantic (but not sexual) attractions and desires to the opposite gender. Most asexual people are willing to have sex with someone they romantically love if they have a tight connection and usually with the sole intent of bearing children, not pleasure. Most asexual people enjoy marriage and romantic love.

Now, I’m not sure if that’s the case with all asexual people but that is true for all the asexual people that i’ve met and/or dated. 

Wouldn’t that mean a male-and-female couple, both asexual but romantically attracted to each other, is the best form of love and marriage?

Most (traditional conservative) Christian leaders and pastors try to preach that being straight is the best sexuality for a traditional conservative Christian, but I think being asexual is better, what do you think?"

"CMV: Running up the score is not always ""poor sportsmanship""","There are some people who are trained to play from whistle to whistle.

For example: if you're playing basketball and winning by 50. 

If you're still playing your starters when you're up by 50, that's poor sportsmanship and honestly, pretty stupid. Once the outcome is not in question, there is no purpose of having your starters in, because by then, it's garbage time and you're risking your best players getting injured. 

Case in point: Derrick Rose, 2012 Round 1 Game 1 against the 76ers.

However, if the second and third stringers are in and playing with the same level of intensity as the starters, that's not poor sportsmanship. 

Just because my opponent didn't show up to play a full game doesn't mean I have to not play a full game.

By extension, Mercy Rule in games other than baseball is stupid, too.

I was reading an article about a football team of 8 year olds who was fined $500 AND the coach was suspended. Why? Their team was up 32-0 and one of the kids ran a Pick-6, which made the score 38-0 and exceeded the 33 point mercy rule. 

Sorry, but a first year kid who scores his first ever interception is going to get caught up in the moment and not think about something so frivolous. He's 8 and he's playing to win because it's what's natural to him"
CMV: Marketing jobs are (mostly) useless and don't bring society forward,"Today, many marketing jobs don't directly contribute to societal progress in the same way that jobs in engineering or other technical fields do for example. Instead, companies often invest heavily in marketing simply to keep up with their competitors. This creates a situation where the focus is on outshining others through advertising, rather than creating truly innovative products or services.

If companies were to decrease the number of engineers or programmers they employed, the impact on innovation and progress could be significant. However, if companies were to reduce their marketing budgets, it would not have a negative impact on society. In fact, it could even be positive if the resources and talent previously dedicated to marketing were instead put towards more meaningful and beneficial work.

A little marketing can be justified but the sector is seriously bloated, currently."

I can list countless examples from music to tv, to movies, etc. I believe it's because creativity is like exploration. There will always be something to explore usually, but it's a lot easier to explore before anyone's discovered anything. The Beatles weren't that original because they took blues music and changed it a little, but they are considered groundbreaking to this day. Maybe someone's doing that today with a drill or something to make a new kind of music, but it's not really that great to a current majority of people. 

A weird example, but Saturday Night Live is not good anymore and it has been declining for years. There are only so many sketch ideas you can do. The same goes for things like professional wrestling. There are only so many angles you can do before you're just repeating and slightly tweaking them to try and make anything even remotely original. These things will never be like how they were in their prime. That's not generational bias, it's reality. The best we can do is try to forget what used to be so things seem new. You can dress up in costumes during sex with your spouse of decades to try and make things fun, but it's the same person and there are only so many costumes.  In my opinion all the best music has been made. You could tell me humans will never write a new piece of music ever again and I'd be fine with that. That's not really a normal thing to think is it? But I can see what's been explored and what there is left to explore and it's a finite thing."

CMV: Bitcoin is Worthless," If we were to ask bitcoin supporters what gives bitcoin value, all their answers would display clear evidence that bitcoin has no value at all. Before explaining this paradox, consider the following example. Imagine if someone would ask you what gives food value. You would probably not answer: “trucks”, “roads,” “store shelves,” “shopping carts and bags,” “accounting ledgers,” “supply and demand,” “trust,” “employee and shipping costs,” or “locks.”

Instead, you would likely answer: “nutritional properties.” Trucks and roads are used to deliver food to retailers. Shelves to display it. Carts and bags to transfer it from shelves to buyers’ homes. Ledgers to record its transactions. Supply and demand to pay it less or more. Trust to build relationship with its sellers. Costs to produce and manipulate it. And locks to protect it. But all that has nothing to do with its value. Food is valuable because it gives people nutrition. All the above engagements, costs, and behaviors associated with food do not exist to honor or worship food but to manage a product capable of giving something to people.

But let’s now check what bitcoin supporters say when discussing bitcoin’s value. If we google “bitcoin is valuable because” or “bitcoin has value because,” we get the following results: “it’s censorship-resistant and has the largest security network out of any cryptocurrency,” “other people are willing to pay for it,” “it is costly to produce,” “it has a fixed supply,” “we believe it’s valuable,” “of the utility of the tech,” “it represents the strongest form of property rights on a global level,” “it is cryptographically recorded as a block on a blockchain,” “you can send it to anyone anywhere,” “people trust its technology,” “of its digital scarcity,” “it is decentralized,” “we say it does,” “you can use it to do something that you can’t use other forms of currency to do: buy drugs online,” “of its intangibility,” etc.

The above results show something pretty interesting. Bitcoin supporters talk about what people give bitcoin instead of what bitcoin gives people. They talk about how they gave bitcoin resistance to censorship, scarcity, faith, trust, the utility of tech, strength, decentralization, intangibility. How they give money, drugs and other stuff to hold bitcoin. And how they have a lot of costs in producing bitcoin. It is as if people are completely unimportant. As if people exist for bitcoin instead of bitcoin for people. As if bitcoin is a deity, and people must worship it and make sacrifices because of its power, grace and glory. The supporters talk about engagements, costs and behaviors associated with bitcoin. About how bitcoin is treated and managed. How this is good for bitcoin. How bitcoin is secured and protected. How everything is done for bitcoin to feel cozy and comfortable. In short, they talk about what people give bitcoin. But they ignore entirely the only important question: what bitcoin gives people?

Why is this question ignored? Well, it is because bitcoin has nothing to give. That is why no one can show, describe, measure, or explain the value of bitcoin. The bitcoin supporters give us clear evidence that bitcoin has no value. All individuals who have ever held bitcoin know this. Namely, they know that new investors were the ones who gave them value, not bitcoin. If new investors were to stop bringing value from the outside and give it to bitcoin holders, there would be nothing to give them. And all their investments would be lost entirely. Words and behaviors of individuals who have ever been in some way associated with bitcoin are screaming: “bitcoin is worthless!”

If we were to ask bondholders what bonds give people, they would quickly answer: “coupons once or twice a year and the face value at maturity.” Pretty simple. They would not bother us with millions of reasons why bonds are great. Nor would they talk about how bonds are treated, protected, or managed. Or whether they are centralized or decentralized. Because this is what people give bonds and not bonds to people.

What does oil give people? Energy for propelling vehicles, heating, producing electricity, etc. Oil extraction machines, tankers, refineries, and storage tanks do not exist for worshiping oil. They exist to manage a product that gives energy to people.

What do stocks give people? Ability to manage them in brokerage ledgers and transfer them fast? No. These abilities are what brokers give stocks. Stocks give people dividends, cash flow, buybacks, liquidation value, management over companies, etc.

Finally, what does the dollar give people? The dollar begins its existence as representation of loans granted by the U.S. banking system to individuals, companies and the U.S. government. These subjects must return the dollar to the system, which is secured by encumbrances such as mortgages or liens that the banking system puts on their property. So what the dollar gives people are two things. It gives them the release of mortgages and other liens held by the banking system. Second, it gives them access to foreclosure sale auctions where the banks sell foreclosed properties of the debtors to satisfy the debt. With the debt being satisfied, the dollar ended its existence as there is no debt to represent anymore.

So when you hear that the dollar or other items have value because of trust, acceptance, the ability to pay taxes, or the ability to exchange them on the market, this is not true. Because trust, acceptence, or tradability is what people give to an item. Likewise, data is how people inform each other about an item. Decentralization is a method of protecting data on an item. Trade is what people give for an item. Price is how much of something people give for an item. Security is how people protect an item. All the mentioned things have nothing to do with the value of an item. The value of an item is what that item gives people. Bitcoin gives them nothing. They only give to bitcoin. That is why bitcoin is worthless. And all that craze about holding or producing bitcoin is a religious-like practice instead of something related to money, finance, or the economy.

In the economy, people subjectively evaluate values given by various items to decide how much of one item they are willing to give in exchange for another. As bitcoin objectively gives nothing to no one, there is no input for performing subjective evaluations. Consequently, people just blindly invest something to become bitcoin holders. Then they embrace the above fallacious logic of bitcoin supporters: ‘the more we give to bitcoin, the more valuable it becomes’. Finally, they live in a collective delusion and preach to everyone about how precious bitcoin is, knowing in the same time that only new investors can save them from their worthless precious."

nobody is just surface level by default and has nothing to explore within themselves. “i’m happy with my life” isn’t a reason to not grow through self-exploration. these people are less deeply connected to themselves and thus cannot deeply connect to others. connecting with your most delicate and difficult and innermost emotions is important, otherwise you are suppressing pain and hurt."

CMV: when looking at the current state of the African Americans in the US you can’t deny the existence of systemic racism without imply drastic inherent inferiority of African Americans.,"
In this I’m going to begin with the term African American but then switch to black. Just to clarify I’m talking about black descendants of slaves brought to what was or what would become the US.

What I mean by my title is that when someone says systemic racism doesn’t exist or that refuse to attribute the vast majority of the reasoning behind the current state of African Americans to systemic racism, you are, either intentionally or inadvertently implying that African Americans are inherently inferior.

So hear me out, when looking at the how the black community developed overtime there’s it really any way that you can separate it from the 450 years of state sanctioned oppression and even more of social exclusion. You can very clearly see these effects when looking at overall statistics on poverty, crime, imprisonment, police deaths, etc.  None of that can really be looked at without the context of racism.

When you take away the oppression seen and look at purely the statistics and not the history of why things are the way they are there’s only one real conclusion. Black people are in the state they are in because of culture and inherent characteristics that push them to act this way. 

For example let’s take poverty. In the US, there is a very clear gap between white families income and black families income. White families make roughly a 33% more on average than black people. About 1/5 of black people live below the poverty line when 8% for white people. So the explanation absent of the racial issues is that black people simply aren’t qualified or attempting to get higher paying jobs. 

Sure at face value, doesn’t seem crazy but if you press that, ask why black people less qualified while still refusing to attribute anything to systemic racism, you land at saying that they are underqualified because their culture prevents them from pursuing a good career as it does white people.

This game can be played with every major problem in the black community today. People who deny systemic racism call it refusing to take personal accountability, but I think it’s more understanding history and how it affects people today."

CMV: Faggot is not a slur.,"When I call a straight dude a faggot, it's not me saying that gay people are bad and need to die, I say it as a synonym for weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might say ""well being gay is not weird"", for a straight man yes, being gay is weird because I am attracted to females, not men. 

For example, if a straight man sees gay porn, he's going to feel grossed out and think the content is weird because he's straight. He's obviously not homophobic, his sexual attraction is just to women. Just like how gay people wouldn't like heterosexual porn. 

Arguing that ""well faggot has been a demeaning message towards gay people for years!"" is also fallacious in nature, as there's multiple exceptions to that rule that people use on an everyday time.

&amp;#x200B;

Idiot was a medical diagnosis used for people with a profound intellectual disability where the mental age is two years or less. I guarantee every single person who thinks ""retard"" or ""faggot"" is a slur has called someone an idiot before, and probably still uses idiot. However, idiot's now been accepted as a term for someone who's stupid. That should be demeaning to people with the disability that ""idiot"" diagnosed people have. But idiot is not a slur.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Moron is the same, so is imbecile. These words are no longer used to demean people who suffer under these diagnoses. It's the same with faggot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Saying faggot is not the same as saying ""nigger"", or ""chink"". Why? Because both the terms have and most likely always will be a term used to demean colored people only. You cannot use those words in any way as a joke unless you're being racist, while you can say faggot without being homophobic."
CMV: John Wick is kind of a selfish asshole,"Spoilers for John Wick movies, obviously. Also, I'm analysing this from the perspective of the movie's universe own rules and events, not movie rules, so ""if he didn't do it there would be no movie"" won't change my view.

Maybe I'm missing something (it's been a while since I watched the movies), but it seems like at this point Wick is just messing up with a, uh, perfectly organised network of assassins and crime syndicates because of his personal vendetta. His actions have just become increasingly unjustified with each movie, compared with the first movie.

Yes, Santino was an asshole in the second movie, but not for requesting Wick's help, but for asking for the murder of his own sister. I don't remember if Santino immediately tells John of his intentions and it's because of that that he refuses, but the fact is, a marker is a marker. And that is further established when John himself makes use of a marker to force Sofia to help him, so we can't really hold Santino back for that (there's the fact that John could instead just killed Santino instead from the get-go, buuut this is not about plot consistency).

Also, if I remember it right, Wick wasn't banished for killing Gianna, and it was just Santino ""avenging his sister"" and not the High Table going after him. He was only truly banished and made a public enemy when breaking the rules of the Continental, something he could've perfectly avoided.

And then, the High Table is posed as the ""big bad guy"" in the third movie, but we haven't seen anything that really make them look bad. It's a world of criminals and assassins, after all, and they haven't show us anything that make them out to be any worse than all the rest. They are just the overseers of the system, which seems to be working just fine. The Bowery King mentions the ""corruption"" of the High Table iirc, but what corruption? He's just another guy with a lot of power that doesn't seem to like to submit to others, and for the entire third movie they are just following their own rules and Wick and his friends keep bending and breaking.

Granted, I do think that the array of overlapped systems create confusion and loopholes, like assassins having to honor a Marker that will break their own rules, but that just seems to be the way it goes -- John himself abuses of this system in the third movie, putting a lot of other people in danger, and then the High Table does what is expected of them -- punishing and going after the people who help John."
CMV: Zip Merging CAN make traffic worse.,"Before you go out on a rant on info that you got from imright.com about zip merging reduces traffic by X % read my disclaimer first. 

I understand the advantages to zip merging. I zip merge myself. It is more effective for traffic to use both lanes in the event of a 2 -1 closure, and then merge in safely, ultimately keeping the flow of traffic moving while utilizing the most area space of the road. This prevents a longer line/que. 

BUT. 

In real life, people speed past everyone, thinking they are a better driver. Then, instead of picking a safe gap to merge into, most people ""zip merging"" will mistime their merge. And this results in them cutting someone off (not not merging) and those people who are in the lane, which has the RIGHT AWAY, have to slam on their breaks so dipshit can get in. Making a chain reaction of flowing traffic brake. Thus resulting in more traffic. 

To add insult to injury, most self-proclaimed zip mergers, are smug about it. Acting like it's some complex subject that people waiting in the line don't understand. 

Here's the thing, if the merge is in a distance that is relatively soon, say 500 ft, you see the big ass arrow, and traffic is moving along at a reasonable rate, zip merge at the EARLIEST open spot you see. Not right when the lane collapses into single lane traffic.

Zip merging is an effective tool that can help relieve traffic. But it is rarely used the correct way, as people overestimate their driving abilities and cut people off. Creating more traffic and possible collisions. 

Bring on the downvotes. I will die on this hill. Lol."

"CMV: AFAB folks are more vulnerable to being trans, so we should not take trans youth's decision lightly","I'm trans myself, but I'm still a little conflicted about young trans people taking hormones, particularly afab people. I hear comments about they hate their breasts, periods, femininity, etc. at a young age, then I wonder, ""don't so many women hate those things? that's not a good enough reason"". I can empathize that we live in a patriarchal society, where cis men are respected more. So many cis women at a young age have felt envious of their brothers that if they were given hrt, they would transition in a heartbeat. My heart goes out to those women living in 3rd world countries. Anyways, what makes it worse that if they decided to detransition, T's effects are pretty irreversible till the point people may perceive them as a trans woman. Most people are only aware of trans womens' existence that we neglect this part about trans men.

My point is that a misogynistic society can definitely influence some young afab people to take hrt. Interestingly, I came across more young trans men than trans women when I think about it"
CMV: People Who Enjoy and are Good at STEM Have it Easier than Humanities People,"Almost all the good jobs these days are some kind of STEM related field: Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine, IT, Finance etc. If you are interested in a ""creative"" career such as art or novel writing, you are more likely to fail since most people do not pay for art anymore. Of course there are stuff like YouTube that creative people can potentially make money on, but that is still incredibly rare. Often, I wish that I enjoyed doing math and engineering and all that and I feel jealous towards people who do genuinely enjoyed it because they learn the material easier than me, while the only reason why I'm studying a STEM subject is because I feel like I have to."

CMV:prostitution shouldn't be legalized,"I want to premise that I live in italy,so it's not a surprise that I grew up in a pretty conservative house,however while I don't have any strong political ideas,you could consider me a liberal

I changed my view on many topics regarding personal freedoms,especially since as I said before,i grew up in a conservative house

the topics I mainly changed my view on are the following:decriminalisation of drugs,abort,trans rights,now i am an advocate for these rights after i did my reaserch

this brings me to the main topic,for the reasons above,i think a well constructed discussion could easily change my view,also i prepared a list of pros and cons i could find by myself:

P1)the government could tax prostitution more heavily than other businesses,therefore giving more money to the government and less to traffickers

C1) however this could also be a con since a taxation would incourage more people to turn to traffickers and the dangers that come with them

P2)the industry could be better regulated to reduce the risk of transmitting STDs and the violence that goes towards prostitutes

C2)i personally don't think a regulation will be enough since this will turn even more people to traffickers for obvious reasons like higher cost to start the business

P3) as much as it pains to admit this,these are still extra jobs for jobless people and a valid alternative to getting the bare minimum from the government every month

C3) only some people will be favorited in the business,wich means even people who work at these places won't have a stable income


C4)this isn't really legal,but more of a moral principle for me,as this will most definitely make the adultery rate rise,and in a country like italy, families falling apart is a hit to the population growth

P.S and Notice well,i am not a politics expert,so don't take what i said like absolute truth,i am probably wrong on some aspects"
"CMV: Christianity as an ""organized religion"" is fundamentally flawed, cultish, fake, and full of liars","The idea of Christianity as ""organized religion"" sees it is, by definition, cultist. The word *cult* has a negative connotation, but by it's black-and-white definition, it falls into that category: *n. a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.* Anyone who associates with organized religion or ""the church"" falls under this category, regardless of which definition they decide to worship or which denomination they fall under.

I do believe in a ""god""--but the existence of such cannot be proven nor disproven. It is entirely unknowable, by my beliefs, and to ""prove"" God exists (Christianity's God, here, as that's the subject matter) would invalidate Christianity, as one of the basis for the entire religion is that God *cannot* be proven, and thusly requires blind faith to follow. The ""what if it was proven that God exists"" argument is one of the main reasons I left the church; the argument itself is self-destructive and paradoxical.

The Bible physically cannot prove the existence of God. All we know is that it's a collection of religious writings that has, shockingly, been able to evolve and adapt with the evolution of mankind. But mankind still wrote it. Take the Flood: we have scientific evidence that the Flood occurred. We have historical evidence and texts. But we also have *other* religions claiming the Flood happened, and it was also caused by their God. So it alone cannot prove the existence of God. Nor can the ""Pontius Pilate"" stone. Okay, so Pontius Pilate existed. That still does not prove the existence of God.

More people use the name of Christianity to justify horrible acts than those who use it to facilitate good acts. Two examples: all of the LGBT+ hate, and obfuscated racism (Jesus constantly depicted as white and refined when he was a Middle Eastern carpenter, as an example). On a more surface level, take anyone who drives a car with the symbol of their church on it. In my experience, those people are some of the worst drivers and road ragers I've ever seen. I'm a full-time delivery driver; I see a lot of them.

The Bible is more a wholistic guide on how to be good and treat others with kindness, in my opinion. Perhaps it was spoken to us from a higher being, or perhaps mankind wrote it themselves with a guide to ""be better"".

What kind of God threatens eternal agony and punishment for those who don't love him? That's not love, that's forced subservience. ""Love me, *or else.*"" And if ""hell"" is simply separation from God...well that doesn't seem to be too bad, now does it? Will I look up to ""heaven"" and feel jealous? Maybe. But if I get punished for trying to be a good person and constantly improve myself, and simply not believing in a deity, that's not a God I want to worship.

I'm an agnostic theist. Feel free to cite any sources, I'm curious to hear what you all think!"
CMV: everyone is capable of being happy by merely deciding “one is allowed to be happy” every day. Mind over matter is not a hoax. [exceptions: people during depressive episodes and/ or with unbalanced brains],"It’s hard sometimes. More often than not. Still: after a long phase of depression I’m finally back thinking “it could be so easy. Wait. Wrong. It is that easy.“ deciding to tackle everything and everyone with positivity.

Simple solution hiding in plain sight the whole time. Sometimes people won’t unlock it for some reason. I didn’t for a while. Nowadays I tell myself in the morning “you will make someone smile today.” and.. what can I say? Works every time. Like a charm. 


Am opened for suggestions – of any kind – towards a recurring “grumpy day”. Like a Sunday. But not that.. Sundays seem to be “family day” or “take a walk and talk-day”. There’s no room for grumpiness.


I’m feeling very positive right now. I believe you can’t change my view. Human beings: adaptive and evolving species. “Mind over matter” and “the only person standing in your way is yourself”. *personal results may vary due to depression and/ or mental health issues preventing any absorption of needed chemicals*


Fair warning though – if you actually change it.. I’ll probably need some time to recharge before answering your comment. Not ghosting. Rather picking the right timing to have a “fight in the Internet”."
CMV: I don't like Russia and China.,"I'll explain why, beginning with Russia.

They paint themselves as a country who only defend themselves, never the aggressors. But history says otherwise. They have a history of ""purges"" of those inside their country who disagree with the status quo, even among their own (back in the Soviet Union, so many purges and harassments of people who were forced to leave).

That leads us to only conclude they're terrible allies, and you best not disagree with them.

And then there's China. They clearly want revenge on the world due to them being basically enslaved and humiliated due to the opium distrubition and nation wide addiction inflicted by the British centuries ago.

It's quite clear they as a nation decided to rise up and conquer the world, grab it by the balls, make everyone DEPENDENT on them. Criticized them? You won't get your products. They've masterfully done it by creating cheap labor and industrial products and easy shipping, attracting the greediness of capitalism.

I dislike them, I get angry just to hear about them - they're always on the news because they're important, of course.

What pisses me off sometimes is that they have made themselves essential for humanity. If all Russians and all Chinese suddenly vanished, the rest of the world would crumble.

Plus, it borderlines xenophobia and other extremist thoughts, to which i've fantasized a lot, which is why I want to get my view changed."
"CMV: Inflation is made up, just don't raise your prices.","If a dozen eggs is a dollar, it should stay a dollar.

What's that? Farmers are being charged more for chicken feed? The chicken feed people should stop raising their prices.

What's that? Chicken feed growers are being charged more for seeds? Seed merchants should stop raising their prices.

Would love to know why this supposedly can't happen. People will point to the Weimar Republic as an example, but tell me where in the supply chain it becomes impossible for me to buy a loaf of bread for 250 Papiermarks? Says who? Who is being so greedy that 250 Papiermarks isn't enough?"
CMV: Being lazy is good because lazy people are the most creative people,"Being lazy is often seen as a negative trait that implies a lack of motivation, ambition, or productivity. However, I argue that being lazy can actually be a good thing because it can foster creativity. Creativity is the ability to generate novel and useful ideas that can solve problems or create value. Lazy people might have more creativity than busy people for several reasons.

First, lazy people might have more time and space to daydream and let their minds wander. Daydreaming is a form of spontaneous thinking that can stimulate imagination and generate new associations. Daydreaming can also help with incubation, which is the process of letting a problem or idea rest in the subconscious mind while focusing on something else. Incubation can lead to insight, which is a sudden realization of a solution or a new perspective. Lazy people might have more opportunities to daydream and incubate their ideas than busy people who are constantly occupied with tasks and deadlines.

Second, lazy people might have more flexibility and openness to try different things. Lazy people might not be bound by rigid schedules, routines, or expectations. They might be more willing to experiment with different approaches, methods, or perspectives. They might also be more receptive to feedback and criticism because they are not attached to their outcomes. Lazy people might have less fear of failure or rejection than busy people who are driven by performance and achievement.
Third, lazy people might have more resourcefulness and efficiency. Lazy people might look for ways to simplify their tasks or avoid unnecessary work. They might find clever shortcuts, hacks, or solutions that can save time and energy. They might also use existing resources or tools in new ways that can create value or novelty. Lazy people might have more incentive to innovate than busy people might.

CMV: AI highlights the exact issue with socialism and why it wouldn't work without being post-scarcity.,"When I engage people on the merits of socialism I have one question that never gets answered: How do we distribute labor under socialism.

It doesn't make sense that everyone is paid the same, or even within certain lower and upper bounds. A doctor has a skillset that might command 200k a year, and a Crab Fisherman also has a skill set that might command 200k a year. The difference here is that a doctor's skill set is in his ability to perform a task, while a crab fisherman's skill set is in his willingness to take on a risk to his life and limb. Under Capitalism, a Crab fisherman can make as much money as he wants correlated to the risk of his health and the price he puts on it. While the Doctor had opportunities to increase his wealth, they are ultimately marginal. There's only so many hours he's allowed to work in a week etc.

So assuming everyone is paid roughly the same on some upper or lower band, wealth inequality can still exist, so long as private property rights exist.

In the case of AI. It's a self contained technology that you can essentially build out on a homestead. You can provide your own Solar energy and purchase the needed components to run the AI, and then fully isolate and insulate yourself from socialism. Now, let's say I decide to leverage the AI on my property to work for me. Let's say I'm an accountant and Jeff is an accountant. I wouldn't ever share my AI with Jeff. I would improve my output with my AI, and then go back to browsing reddit or take on a second or third job. I don't have to disclose to my employer *how* I'm doing the work so efficiently, and even if I did it doesn't entitle him to my AI. He can either keep me as a very efficient employee or lose me to another firm where I will create the same amount of value.

I'm sure this exists in less complex examples than AI. But AI is sort of the extreme end of this hypothetical. Under capitalism this would be a legitimate course of action, and its even encouraged. Under socialism this would be seen as disruptive and problematic and ultimately would create a tumor of wealth inequality for anyone who is simply more capable of utilizing and analyzing the value of their own time. What's more, the leverage acquired allows the individual to do the one thing that socialists don't want. Divorcing your time from the money you make. If you have 3 jobs you can manage in a 40 hour work week you are making triple the wages of everyone else around you, which means you can pay up to 2 increments of your wages to hire other people to make your life better. Even if you exist within a system you can subvert that system and essentially walk it back to capitalism *that works just for you.*

To this end, short of enacting violence or stealing property from people, socialism can't work. Furthermore, *IF* the outcome of producing a revolutionary technology is to punish the person who made it by stripping them of their property for the common good, then that is the exact same disincentive to work hard that anti-socialists talk about. It literally promotes being a luddite because there's no reason to work hard or problem solve without some kind of upside for the person who goes out of their way to produce such technology.

This is all a really complex end-state of the Socialist Toothbrush meme. Wherein if you own your toothbrush you can create a service cleaning toilets with it, and the government can't destroy private property rights otherwise people won't participate in the government. In this case AI is the new toothbrush, and it's held in a domain of your private property, but can still be used to render services better than anyone else. Unless socialism can solve for this, it can't work."

CMV: Missing free throws can cost you wins.,"Greetings everyone. As a fan of basketball I need to get this off my chest. I'm curious as to how folks will take this point of view. 

One of my favorite parts about basketball is the buzzer beater. Having watched a multitude of buzzer beaters, I noticed a pattern. Maybe it's just me, but I've seen most teams win on buzzer beaters after their opponent misses either one or both free throws. In some games, a team misses the second free throw on purpose to run down the clock. It may make sense in that you want to give your opponent less time to heave a 70 footer, but what if the 70 footer miraculously goes in before the buzzer? Then the team missing the free throw either has to play overtime or outright loses! Players should always make their free throws! 

I can give an instance back in 2010 when Chandler Parsons won the game for the Florida Gators against the NC State Wolf Pack. The Wolf Pack intentionally missed a free throw before CP25 drilled a 70-footer. I was thrilled that the Gators won, but the announcers puzzled me when they said that missing the second free throw was a wise move on the Wolf Pack's part. The game would have gone to overtime if the Wolf Pack made the second free throw. 

I welcome disagreements and counterarguments with open arms, eyes, and ears. If anything, I would appreciate if there's another reason to miss free throws."
CMV: A class focusing on gender studies should be a required course in high school (USA),"Sexism runs rampant in the United States, and it’s built into the foundation of this country. Everything that you touch probably has a male bias, from seatbelts that aren’t designed for a woman’s body, to city planning based around a typical man’s schedule, to the curriculum were taught in schools. As a high school student, I can confirm that none of this is taught to us, and the results are both a disrespect of women and the danger of continuing this cycle of ignorance. Therefore, students would benefit greatly from a one semester class at summer point in their high school careers that breaks down gender inequality in the United States, and gives us solutions"

"CMV: Either Ukraine went through a brutal agricultural collectivization, or many tens of millions more Slavs would have been exterminated by Western imperialism that had been talking about getting Lebensraum in the East since 1890"," The drought of 1932 was going to result in hundreds of thousands of dead Soviet citizens regardless of what the Stalinist degenerated state did, because the vast majority of peasants were still harvesting their grain with sickles and scythes in Ukraine, with very little industrialized agriculture. Best case scenario under a capitalist Ukraine would have been one million starved to death in '32 through '33, and then Western imperialism would have forced Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian and Kazakh kulaks to sell out vast tracts of land to Western capitalists, which would have resulted in 30 million starved to death or otherwise exterminated by 1945, and the worst case scenario would have been 6 million dead Ukrainians by '33, and nearly half of all of the people living East of Poland dead by 1945.   


 Sound unlikely? Look at what Belgium did to Congo, exterminating 10 million, nearly 50% of Congo over 40 years, and that was WITHOUT a hard winter, or the 6 million Indian children and elderly that died every year as a result of British imperialism for 200 years (why did India's population only grow 70 percent over 200 years and England/Wales' grew over 900 percent?), ALSO without a hard winter.   


 Material interests, even that of the pitiful atomized kulak fiefdoms with their handful of day laborers and two or three cows, entrench themselves, which is why a region like Ukraine, despite being so similar to the American Midwest and heartlands, lagged nearly 100 years behind those counterparts, because once the Native Americans were conveniently dead or driven off, it was easy for new technologies and material interests to get started fresh without having to displace a class of landlords because they simply didn't exist in the heartland/Midwest. Ukraine had no such vacuum to expedite development and industrialization; the irony of having a headstart of over four thousand years in Ukraine's case as well as being a very fertile breadbasket is that without an industrial level of communication and political cohesion, all those people living in the region are not going to just magically cooperate with each other to maximize their economic output, they are going to do what humans do, which is atomize into their own spheres of influence.   


 Such a backwards state of affairs is extremely unlikely to industrialize in such a way to allow the region to defend herself, because to do so you would have to upend all the material interests that are entrenched in doing things the way that they know will work for the short term; the reason that Rome couldn't sustain herself, despite being socially progressive compared to the Celts/Goths/barbarians she conquered, was because all the plutocratic interests were entrenched in doing things the way they always had, and those barbarian hordes were free to experiment and adopt things like the stirrup and other dynamic military arrangements, whereas Rome shorted out with her entrenched semi-feudalism of mercenaries being more loyal to their general than to Rome, and a massive proletarii in the cities that were priced out of their farm labor by slave plantations, unable to become the social force that could protect Rome from successive invasions.  


 Another example, to end the American Civil War, the Union had to send in someone to destroy the Confederacy's economic base, because they were entrenched in how they did things and weren't going to give up their slaves without a fight.   


 The unique deficiencies of Stalin, in that he was very well politically organized but was unable/unwilling to understand hard aspects of science (Lysenkoism, etc.) resulted in one of the worst possible socialist agricultural collectivization scenarios, and a semi-successful Barbarossa."
"CMV: Tipping culture in America is a diseased, internalized scam","I’ll be right up front: I always try to be a slightly above-average tipper, but I absolutely hate tipping culture in this country. A tip, as understood by every other country on Earth, is a *bonus* for good service, to be paid on top of *existing* wages as a “good job” from grateful customers. It should not, and was never meant to be, a replacement for wages themselves. 

The way they actually function in America is as a way for employers to shift their labor costs onto their customers. This has not only been successful, but completely internalized by the entire culture, so much so that if a customer does not leave a sufficient tip, they are seen as an asshole because even the law itself dictates that tipped workers aren’t entitled to the minimum wage that everyone else is. 

Tourists may be absolutely forgiven for thinking “well, isn’t this what they’re paid for”, because no, they’re *not* paid for it as they are in the tourists’ countries. 

Sure, some tipped workers, for example those working in high-end restaurants, can make far more than they could on an hourly wage alone, but that should not be an excuse for letting the vast majority of service workers toil and dance like monkeys relying on what is effectively the generosity of strangers to survive. 

Employee pay is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the employer, not the customer (who is already paying for the service itself). "

CMV: Will Smith should have been cancelled,"I’m shocked that Will Smith hasn’t had more backlash since he assaulted Chris Rock at the Grammy’s. There should’ve been posts about boycotting his movies, or people calling him out for never apologizing to Chris Rock personally (because he hasn’t), but there’s just been silence. Is there a reason he’s just been given a pass on acting like a toddler? I don’t care what kind of joke a comedian makes, absolutely no one should resort to that kind of tantrum. 

I mean sure, he gave a public apology. To the public. But who cares about the guy who was actually hit…

"CMV: All jobs should pay the rent **and** enough for a 21st century standard of living, and if you don't want to or are unable to work you should still get 21st century standard healthcare and housing","Whatever the cause is, whether it's the lack of money or the sheer lack of supply of housing, living a 21st century standard life shouldn't be a luxury. Healthcare shouldn't be a luxury. It should be standard, for both pragmatic and ethical reasons. Luxuries should be things like cars, sporting events, alcohol. Standard living conditions should be housing, potable water, transportation, food, education, healthcare, communication, and some basic entertainment and a way to play team sports.  


The reason why it's not that way is because in a global system of capitalism, you have to have at least one region that maintains a race to the bottom to extract as much profit as possible, because the anarchy of markets demands that ""faith and credit"" of the social construct of ""profit"" for stability, because if you don't try to extract as much profit as possible then the other guy is going to and undercut your business, such is the semi-stable system that the Western world converged on  and the regions that don't conform to that low common denominator to provide a basic welfare of living almost always went through a cataclysmic collapse to force them to do so, like WWII, during which it was the actual socialist revolutionaries that pushed the reformists hard to actually get the welfare states in those countries like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, not the liberal reformists just being all-around-good-guys."
CMV: female products aren’t costlier due to sexism.,"
Here’s my reasoning.

Why would they be?
They are more expensive because people buy them, not sexism.
I believe that the statistics show that these companies are sexist, but sexism is unprofitable.
So what’s the point?

Market forces cause this as there used to be a reason because gender norms were more highly enforced.

And to go on a bit of a tangent. racism is unprofitable as well, as the slaves required housing and other things that had to be paid directly by the owner.

To change my view, you must, prove that market forces aren’t the reason for higher costs for what are considered “feminine” products."

I have yet to find any left wing/left leaning media personalities/pundits who have criticized Gov Newsom for leaving his state during one of the worst winter storms of all time, which has resulted in many deaths, hundreds of thousand without power/food/fuel and thousands trapped under near record setting snow.  As Gov, he should be criticized more so than Senator Cruz because Gov Newsom conducts the majority of his business within the state, is the head of the executive branch for the state, and has direct authority to impact policy in California.  The emergency was so severe, that Gov Newsom has extended the tax deadline for impacted counties until Oct 2023.  

&amp;#x200B;

Senator Cruz conducts the majority of his business outside of Texas (mainly DC), and does not have direct control over state policy.  

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that Newsom ditching his state when many people are dying, hundreds of thousands are without power/food, and multiple people stranded within their homes is an act worthy of more criticism from all sides who criticized Senator Ted Cruz for leaving Texas.

Please convince me that all humanism and human rights bullshit does not have to control me and that there is nothing wrong with becoming a violent criminal and dying young in a massacre. Or whatever other alternative you might know. But first, i gotta get over this damned humanism that keeps telling me to defend myself and my boundaries instead of telling me to feel good while I'm being abused. The latter is shitty enough but having the latter anyways as a societal baseline and then putting human rights on top of that, it is only making me suffer. I want it to end.

I want you to change my mind about fully giving myself to the darkness. I want it but i can't escape that godfucked christian-islamic indoctrination my mother weakened me with to be better able to abuse me.

So, please for the love of unholy nemesis, please convince me to abandon all toxic beliefs about justice, rights, laws, etc. None of that should exist in my mind. Also no feelings, no pain, i want nothing to do with that anymore.

So, help me escape this crazy belief system that i was brainwashed into through trauma based mind control and worse. Help me see that there is no stupid shit like God or moral or literally anything other than either having power and enjoying life or being raped, fucked and killed.

CMV: Nobody should believe that a scientific theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt without studying it.,"My thesis is that nobody should believe that a scientific theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt without studying it.

There are several key terms in that thesis, which must be explained:

* ""Scientific theory"": A scientific theory, as I am using the term here, is a theory about the natural world that the overwhelming majority of scientific community says has been established beyond a reasonable using the scientific method.

* ""Wrong beyond a reasonable doubt"": A reasonable doubt is a doubt that has some actual, substantial basis in fact or argument. I used this term rather than the term ""certainly wrong"" because I don't want to get into philosophical questions about whether absolute certainty is possible. ""You might be in the Matrix"" does not count as a reasonable doubt.

* ""Studying it"": As a bare minimum, I want to say that you have to be able to accurately summarize the theory at a college undergraduate level, as well as the principal lines of evidence in its support, to dispute it. I am not saying everyone above that cutoff has the right to dispute the theory, but I am saying nobody below it should believe that the theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. (I am also not literally saying you must enroll in a college class.)

As a clear example of what I'm talking about, consider someone who watches a creationist video on Youtube and decides that the theory of evolution is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. This person is not being reasonable, provided that they know that they're disagreeing with the consensus. They shouldn't think the scientific community is wrong about evolution with that much certainty without really knowing what they are saying or why.

I am really interested to see how people dispute my thesis here! CMV."
"cmv:The Chinese should thank the British for launching the Opium War, the blacks should thank the triangular trade, and the natives of North America should thank the Americans for their arrival.","Disclaimer: I am not a racist. Everything I said was reasonable and logical.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that many people are saddened by the ""colonial history"" of Western countries, but without the colonial invasion of Western countries, this world may still be a dark world.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if the British hadn't started the Opium War, then China might still have an emperor. The Chinese are likely to kneel before the emperor now. The British invaded China, which in fact helped the Chinese get rid of the feudal era.

&amp;#x200B;

For another example, if there is no triangular trade, black people can only live in Africa. I know that blacks live a miserable life in American manors, but are blacks living a good life in Africa? Blacks were indeed enslaved by Americans, but blacks were also enslaved by African chiefs.

&amp;#x200B;

To give another example, the natives of North America may resent the Americans (or the British) for taking their land. However, the natives in North America are living a very good life now, and the quality of life is definitely better than before the Americans came. Do North American natives like to live in primitive society? I think they must not like it."

I know that political terms are usually done in years because in the past, communications is an issue, hence the need for terms lasting years to supervise and implement governmental policies. But with the internet and modern communications shortening time and in a sense automating political process, I think we can work with much shorter political office terms such as terms measured in minutes at least or weeks at most to prevent backsliding of an elected government into a dictatorship and entrenchment of power."

* The user falls into the trap of *wishful thinking*. Many people are simply bad at statistical analysis (look at lotteries).
* Games do often not specify that % chance causing the user to lose a lot more money than intended.
* Increased risk of parents losing money from their teenagers stealing their creditcard. (I know it is the parents responsibility but that doesn't make it better). 
* People and especially teenagers fall into the trap of a gambling addiction and no one is held accountable.

CMV: No alcohol or weed is better than moderation.,"TL;DR: If you are someone planning to just 'try' alcohol or weed in hopes that you will never take them again or only have them in moderation, don't, because you will be much better off and will find more happiness in never having never experienced them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

My main line of reasoning is that ""pleasure"" is always relative: you crave something only after you have experienced it and reached that level of pleasure. A simple example would be asking someone who has never had a certain delicious cake if he needs it to feel happy; the most probable answer will be ""No, but I might try it because people say it's good"". Since the person does not know how it exactly feels like, there is no craving for it. On the contrary, someone who once had that cake will most likely have it repeatedly because he has experienced its height of pleasure, and needs a similar exposure to pleasure to stay content or satisfied.

What makes weed and alcohol the subject of this discussion is that they are less prominent compared to high-sugary or junk food; in many countries, people never consume them until they are old enough or ever, and this means that they are still in control to never consume them ever. Weed and alcohol also seem to cause more (health) problems than junk food in general. Although logically, it would make sense to eliminate junk food too, that is relatively far-fetched.

&amp;#x200B;

**The crux of the discussion:**

Weed and alcohol undoubtedly have some positive effects. They can be used as means to become more social, and just be happier overall at the moment. But this is where my problem lies: once you reach those heights, you crave them again, and you start to feel life without those substances as 'lesser'; you need them to deal with social anxiety or just feeling down in general. Someone who has never consumed them will strive to improve oneself (be better at social gatherings, etc.) without them because his brain will not know that he needs them. This is definitely something that is achievable without such substances and is just not something that is given on a platter; it takes a little more effort.

The reason why I say life without such substances is better is that you are in general healthier and happier without realizing it. Alcohol is inarguably poison no matter the dosage, and anyone who says otherwise is finding an excuse to keep drinking and not feel guilty. Weed on the other hand does not seem to have physiological effects, but the dependence on it mostly will affect your life eventually and enough to the point when you would have been better off without it.

The counter-argument to this would be that consuming them in moderation will make having health problems unlikely. This is flawed because I ask, why do you even need to consume them in moderation? Since people have experienced such elevated pleasure they go for it again but also need to force themselves to be in moderation because of the negative effects. A lot of them fail and become alcoholics or potheads, which clearly shows that avoiding them completely is better than moderation. And say you are someone who is able to have them in complete moderation, do you really think you have more ""pleasure"" overall than someone who has never tried those substances and does not need to stop himself every day? The latter mostly will find similar pleasure in something much less harmful because he does not know how much 'better' using these substances is and therefore does not care/need them.

Another way to look at this will be the difference between fighting the urge to indulge in something because someone said how good it feels, versus, fighting the urge after actually experiencing it and having chemical reactions in the brain. The latter will be significantly more difficult because you have experienced its 'height' of pleasure, and now there is no going back without extremely high willpower and self-control, which a majority of the population unfortunately lack.

CMV: Jews have no legitimate claim to the land of modern day Israel. A two-state solution is already a major concession made by the Palestinians.,"After reading about the Israel-Palestine conflict, I was shocked at how rarely people point out the flawed logic behind pro-Israel arguments. I do not believe Jews have a meaningful claim to the land of Israel, and a ""Jewish state"" should have never been established in the region. I will be debunking common arguments for a Jewish state of Israel below, and will gladly respond to any others that are brought up to this post.

1) The Jews deserve a homeland because centuries of history have shown their safety is never guaranteed in non-Jewish countries.

I agree, Jews have every right to establish their own country so they do not have to worry about being a persecuted minority. However, Jews do not have a right to establish a Jewish state over a region that is already inhabited by non-Jewish people. If the principal concern is establishing a country where Jews can be safe, why does it have to be established in a region that is majority Muslim? There are other regions of the world with unoccupied land, but Jews insist their nation be established over the historic land of Israel. In this case, the ""Jews just want a homeland"" is a red herring to avoid the issue of a Jewish state being established over a region occupied by Arabs for centuries.

2) Jews legally bought land in Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Yes, Jews legally bought land during both the Ottoman and British administration of the region. However, these were regarding private ownership of the land, which is different from sovereignty of the land. Many Chinese people buy real estate in Vancouver, but it does not mean Chinese people buy the sovereignty of Vancouver. The land is still legally the territory of Canada, Chinese people cannot establish a ""Chinese state"" because they bought real estate in Vancouver. Therefore, Jews legally buying land in Palestine does not mean it gives them the right to establish a Jewish state on that land.

3) Jews earned the right to establish a Jewish state in Israel after it negotiated the Balfour Declaration from Britain.

This was a colonial era document. If you think colonial territory agreements should be maintained, then you are against the independence of Korea, Vietnam, India, etc. The British should have never made such promises on the first place, especially considering they made overlapping promises to the Arabs in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence. A similar argument is that Jews earned the land after winning a war instigated by an Arab coalition. This is right by conquest, which has no longer been recognized by international law since the resolution of WW2. 

4) Jews made better use of their land than the original Ottoman/Arab landowners. ""Israelis like to build, Arabs like to bomb and..."" Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, where gay people can have their relationship legally recognized.

People bring up these points because they believe Israelis have made ""better use"" of the land than their Palestinian Arabs counterparts, therefore Jews deserve the land. This is not how sovereignty works. Imperial Japan was famous for using this argument to justify the annexing/colonization of Okinawa/Taiwan/Manchuria/Korea/etc. This was almost universally condemned, and Imperial Japan is nothing more than two mushroom clouds over the ash heap of history. Even if Japan made greater crop yields/repealed some antiquated practices/provided industrial living conditions to these colonies, doesn't change the fact they were occupying land and people against their will.

5) Arabs live much more peaceful and prosperous lives in Israel, compared to life in Palestine. Israel grants equal rights to it's Arab citizens, many of which are part of the Israeli government.

Just because you give equal rights to Palestinian Arabs doesn't mean you are entitled to their land. By this logic, US can annex even more of Mexico, so long as it offers the Mexicans in the region full US citizenship. It also doesn't solve the issue that the Arabs cannot truly be equals when a Jewish state occupies a majority Muslim region. If you believe in truly equality, you would not need to enshrine Israel as a ""Jewish state,"" this is just to hedge against the fact the region of Palestine is majority Arab Muslims.


6) Jews were the original inhabitants of the region, Jews have maintained a continuous presence in the region of Israel throughout history.

Regardless of who the original inhabitants of the region were, the majority of the region has been inhabited by Arab Muslims for the past few centuries. If you believe being the original inhabitants entitles you to the land forever, does that mean the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand have to return the land to the indigenous population? These indigenous groups were displaced within the past 5 centuries, with some regions still being majority indigenous until the past 2 centuries, whereas Jews did not administer the region for over a millennium. I understand this is a very serious part of your identity, with the name ""Palestine"" already being a huge scar in your ethnic history, but we cannot undo these tragic events in your history. America is named after an Italian explorer, our capital is named after a colonizer and a slaveowner. The Jews are not the only ones who have historical trauma.

7) There was no such thing as a ""Palestinian"" identity until recently, they were just Arabs. Arabs have 22 countries, why can't they accept there being one Jewish state?

Most serious people are not saying there cannot be a Jewish state. They are merely arguing that you cannot establish a Jewish state over land that is already inhabited by Arabs. Just because Arabs have a lot of land, doesn't mean you are entitled to some of their land. By this logic, Korea is entitled to some of China's land, Bangladesh is entitled to some of India's land, and Mongolia is entitled to some of Russia's land. It doesn't matter whether the Arabs considered themselves distinctly Palestinian, they are not Jewish and do not want to be under a Jewish state.

8) Israel has always been willing to give concessions for peace, but the Palestinians always reject peace treaties.

From the very start, these peace proposals have been favored towards Israel. The 1947 borders gave the Jewish minority sovereignty over the majority of land in the region. Other sore spots include Israel wanting sovereignty over East Jerusalem, and Israel wanting their borders to encompass areas with arable land and water sources. A two state solution is already a large concession for the Palestinans to make, Israel should offer more concessions.

9) Israel wants peace, but the Palestinians choose terrorism. Israel has no choice but to make ""hard decisions"" for its own security. The Arab League/Muslim Brotherhood/Iran all want us blown off the map.

Palestinians had no interest in being under a Jewish state, yet it was imposed against their will. It is not unlike the Macabbeans, who revolted against their Seleucid occupiers. You can't occupy/displace people and then be shocked when they fight back. Israel is not a perfect victim, it exacerbated the problem when it bankrolled extremists groups in Palestine in order to destabilize the opposition. While I acknowledge Israel has legitimate security concerns from hostile neighbors, what did you expect when you displaced Muslims to establish a Jewish state in a region dominated by Muslims?



Ideally, the region of Palestine should have been one state, where the rights of the Jewish minority would be enshrined in its constitution. Ultimately, I recognize that Israel has existed for almost 75 years, and at this point the one-state solution is no longer viable. Most of the world has made the right steps in accepting Israel as a member of the world. I wrote this post because I wanted to point out that the framework of the two state solution should have never been used in the first place, and the two state solution is the consequence of the UN's failure to objectively solve the problem in 1947."
CMV: Taking insult is a choice,"This one seems to cause a lot of anger within some people, though when I ask in my circle of friends they all *strongly* agree. It's been over 10 years that I ever remember taking insult into anything, when someone told me that I sucked at a video game back when I still did. Here are some examples of moments when someone attempted to insult me:

**Your mother is XYZ** (some random guy on LoL)

I factually know my mother isn't XYZ so your insult doesn't matter. And even if my mother was XYZ, you're just stating a fact. Facts are facts and don't hurt me.

**You're only charitable because it helps the name of your business** (Guy on trustpilot lol)

I was charitable before I had a business and when I had a business. Your argument is invalid. I love being charitable, deep down inside I know why I am charitable and that's what matters.

**You'll never amount to anything** (My teacher)

I just thought to myself ''okay we'll see''.

**You've got a big head, you're ugly** (Other students in high school)

Okay, noted. How relevant.

**The fact that you don't take insults means you have no self-respect**

Again, I know is factually untrue. Being able to separate truth from opinion doesn't mean I lack self-respect. It means that your words are just words to me. It means nothing. 

''**Insulting'' friends**

In my circle of friends we say things that other take as insult. Such as ''You're fat'' or ''You're being an ass to your wife, apologize''. Do we cry over that ''insult''? No we say things that need to be said so we don't go around as losers who walk around as petty victims. Instead take individual responsibility over what was said and see if the thing that was said comes from a place of ''good'' or ''bad'' intentions.

CMV: love and sex is the oldest form of discrimination,"I remember watching a YouTube video a long time ago and under that video saw a comment which stated the above statement. At first I laughed about it. Thinking things like only an incel or someone who has been hurt by a either man or woman would say such stuff. 

But recently I've begun journalising and so often I try to write and post about social, financial and other issues faced by various men and women of our generation online. So, as always I was trying to write about the same when out of nowhere I was reminded of this quote and now can't help but shake it out how it might be true. Or at least some part of it. 

But whenever I try to discuss it with my friends or on platforms like Discord and such other places, they always get furious. Calling me incel, misandrist, sexist and misogynist and almost all of them are not able to have a civil discussion. Nobody is willing to put some sort of critical thinking and put their biases aside and have a well formed logical and rational discussion. 

I sort of can understand why people get emotional and sentimental about this topic. But part of me feels it's necessary to talk about why this above statement is true and how it can impact society whether in a negative or positive manner."

While there are definitive benefits to TikTok, it is doing too much harm and should be banned."
"CMV: A big step towards equality is to somewhat allow sexist, homophobic, and racist humour","Firstly, there is a difference between bullying/discrimination/harrassment and humour. This view is typically around humour, making fun of eachother in a lighthearted manner.

Let me explain. In modern social media, there is a pretty common idea that if a ""straight white man"" (yes, I am a straight white man if that matters) makes fun of someone who doesn't match any 3 of those factors (straight, white, male), they are deemed as homophobic, racist, or/and sexist. Same can be said if they make a joke about the 3 factors as a whole.

At the same time, social media has an ongoing idea that making fun of straight white men should be acceptable. I imagine it's a way of trying to rid the superior image the 3 factors hold when combined. The problem is, it also creates a more solid identity around superiority. Almost saying, ""you can't make fun of us until we are of equal value.""

My first example is the show Friends. If you were to ask, who is the most superior of the group? It would be difficult to judge, as all 6 are constantly failing and succeeding at the same rate as eachother. Their mistakes are often what makes the show funny, as we can all relate to each of them. If only the men had failings, the women wouldn't be seen as superior, just boring and unrelatable.

The problem with society is, people are trying to draw a line on comedy. Saying ""you can't make fun of trans-people"", but expect a treatment of equality. Then when you draw a line on comedy, it becomes more tempting for comedians to cross this line. Then people get offended and try defend the targeted group.

e.g. South Park is an easy example. Telling South Park creators, ""you aren't allowed to make fun of black people"", will almost always lead to an episode doing the opposite. For every line that is drawn, comedians will take advantage of crossing this line.

I imagine this is due to the amount of surprise the jokes place on us, not expecting a comedian to make fun of a particular topic. Same reason kids will laugh the hardest when someone dares to prank their teacher. Once people start accepting the jokes that are held against them and laughing along, people will develop a sense of equality. If you obey the lines/rules being placed, claiming some humour isn't allowed on some people, you are placing a sense of inferiority on them as well."

"CMV: Film (and video games and books) would be better off if there could be no more than one sequel, and no spin-offs or remakes","Of the top [40 top grossing films of all time](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW), only 4 are the first in their series (Avatar, Titanic, Frozen, and Jurassic Park) and of those, only one could be said to be an original story (Avatar). Even if you expand to allow sequels, only 5 of the top 40 are sequels (Avatar 2, Top Gun: Maverick, Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, Pirates of The Caribbean 2), and 3 of those are nostalgia sequels (Avatar, Top Gun, and Incredibles) that came out at least a decade after the original.

With the massive success of franchises, there is no need to create an original character, plot, or setting, as you will be outcompeted by a generic Marvel movie or Disney remake. Also, many recent movies have been much worse off because they hunt the moneybags from cinematic universes (The Mummy remake, DCEU, Dracula Untold), instead of just trying to make an interesting story.

If franchises are bad, then remakes are even worse. A franchise can get by with very little new content, but a remake, by definition, usually adds nothing at all. Spin-offs can vary from just leeching off of the original (Minions) to actually pretty good (Logan), but generally don't add more than an original story would have.

I am willing to concede that sequels give the original more incentive to succeed and allow a successful original to get the resources it needs to have a fuller story. I also fully admit that there are some good movies in franchises, like The Batman. However, as a whole, I believe that franchises do more harm than good for creativity."

CMV: The USA should nationalize its oil companies,"For the most part, I don't think the government should be in charge of operating industry. However, I think that oil drilling is one of the few industries that the government would be better at administering than the private sector. Here's my case:

**1. Its our oil**

Yes, constructing rigs and processing petroluem costs money, but it doesn't cost $3/gallon. Unlike other private industries, where the majority of the products value comes from ingenuity or labor, the majority of the economic value of oil is the carbon-based energy it contains. BP and Shell didn't give it that energy, but they get to sell it and consume that naturally-endowed value privately. These are natural resources, and as such, the value of those naturally-created resources should be enjoyed publicly, not consumed by a few private entities.

**2. It would decrease cost**

First, costs would decrease simply because that the government could sell the oil at cost, instead of charging more to turn a profit. The bigger factor, though, is that private oil companies [purposefully limit the supply of oil](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/energy/us-oil-production/index.html) in order to increase its cost. Removing the profit incentive would resolve this problem, and allow for increased \*domestic\* drilling as we continue the transition to non-fossil-fuels. Any profits this public corporation did make could be redirected towards social programs that will ultimately benefit the general public. 

**3. The government already calls the shots**

Even though it's private, the energy economy is definitely not a free market. The government already decides when, where and how oil companies are allowed to drill. If the government is already directing these private corporations, I see no reason why we can't cut out the gluttonous middle man and administer it publicly. 

**4. Killing Big Oil will accelerate the green energy transition**

There's no doubt that Washington's hesitancy to help facilitate a transition to renewable energy has been driven by the lobbying influence of major oil producers. That's why, for most of the past 50 years, oil has been much more heavily subsidized than renewable energy. Removing the corrupting influence of the Big Oil lobby will clear the primary hurtle stopping us from addressing climate change.  

**5. Dependency on Foreign Oil is a National Security Risk**

A lot of people in the United States (esp on Fox News) seem to think that drilling more in America = more oil for America. Not so, at all. When the oil gets drilled, it belongs to a multinational oil corporation that sells it on the *world* market. This fact makes the price of our oil dependent on the world price, meaning that the cost of our energy is directly a function of our relationship with concerning states like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Russia. By taking public ownership of domestic oil production, we will always have enough to consume domestically, regardless of our geopolitical engagements with foreign actors. 

**6. It's been tried and works throughout the world**

Nationalizing oil is by no means a fringe or ""communist"" position, at least internationally. [Many other countries](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/largest-state-owned-oil-companies-1200px-1.jpg) have nationalized their oil industry, and it has proven to be comparably- if not more- efficient than the private market. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Brazil and India have all had exceptionally profitable public oil companies, to name a few.

Those are my reasons for wanting to expropriate America's major oil companies. For the sake of argument, I concede that this nationalization scheme would be unconstitutional under the 4th Amendment, and would require a constitutional amendment granting that kind of power to Congress. But, if Congress could nationalize oil, why do you think it shouldn't?"

And there wasnt even a rule referring to criticizing the news or the site bugs etc.. and the funny thing is that I looked for the text and they DID copy it lol there were numerous webisites with 100% the same texts and uploaded that piece of new hours before that forum.

CMV: mentioning other wars in the context of the Ukraine war was NOT and is NOT whataboutism,Imagine a bully who bullies classmates right and left with no repercussions and the school doesn’t do shit one day comes another bully who beats the hell out of the original bully only then the school starts acting because bullying is wrong.  Of course none of the people who were bullied have any sympathy to that bully because he got what he deserved (in their view) however the school accuses the bullied of supporting bullying and says they’re doing “whataboutism” (a word Im really sick off). Of course this hypothetical scenario can get worse if you replace bullying with rape or even worse murder and war.

CMV: Marijuana is a lot more harmful than most people realize,"Just to give a bit of context, I am a former Marijuana user with a lot of experience on this subject. I started smoking pot when I was about 14 years old, I've been a pot dealer before, I used to live in a grow opp (my roommates were growing weed in the house), I've known hundreds and hundreds of stoners. So basically, I know what I'm talking about.

A lot of people view Marijuana as this relatively harmless drug, saying that alcohol is worse, all that jazz. I gotta say, I flat out disagree. 

The first thing I will point out is something that not a lot of people seem to talk about or even be aware of. Marijuana has the potential to cause serious mental illnesses and psychosis. I've known people who straight up had to go to the psych ward because of drug induced psychosis, solely because of Marijuana. Obviously, it doesn't happen to most people, but this shit does happen.

The next thing is something that we've all heard, but a lot of people are in denial about it. Weed makes you lazy / dumb. I know so many stoners who pretend this isn't true, but they are in denial. Obviously, there are exceptions. Some people are able to smoke regularly and still be high functioning. Some people are able to moderate themselves. But generally speaking, it is very easy to fall into a trap when it comes to using Marijuana. 

Lastly, weed is terrible when it comes to social life. I'm sorry, but most people are just straight up boring when they are high. When people are drunk, they are usually being social, but when people are high, they usually mellow out and become less social. Especially when it comes to indica. Not only that, but it makes you smell bad."
"CMV: Marijuana is the most dangerous and harmful drug in the world, posing more significant harm to society than any other drug.","I believe that marijuana is the most dangerous drug in the world and harms society more than any other drug. Yes, that includes drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine and fentanyl.

While I am aware of the argument that many of these other drugs have caused many deaths yet no deaths have been ""directly attributable to marijuana"", I believe that there are other dangers that are often ""invisible"" and not taken into account when considering the harm that a drug does to society as a whole.

First, I want to begin by stating that I believe the widespread availability and social acceptability of marijuana potentiate the severity of marijuana's adverse effects on society because it discredits the seriousness of the drug's consequences (the following of which have been researched and evidenced). This is a significant factor in my view because I don't see how it doesn't open the door to widespread marijuana usage turning into what happened with cigarettes (with society widely accepting it as safe, only to regret it and deal with disastrous consequences decades down the road)

\- Students who smoke marijuana have poorer educational outcomes than their nonsmoking peers

 \- Those who use it regularly may be functioning at a reduced intellectual level most or all of the time.  

 \-&gt; Regular marijuana usage during periods of development in the adolescent brain has shown to be able to cause drops in IQ

\- Heavy marijuana use has been linked to students being less likely to graduate high school, enroll in college or trade programs, and more likely to not want to seek employment. 

\- As perception of harm decreases, usage continues to increase.

I believe that marijuana has robbed our collective society of so much productivity while also robbing its users of their potential. I can't help but imagine that out of the millions of people who have fallen victim to marijuana's consequences, society may have missed out on people who had the potential to accomplish things such as finding cures for rare diseases or cancers, but instead have had their futures stripped away from them by marijuana.

I believe that these factors, along with the social acceptability of marijuana causing such factors to be exponentially more dangerous, are reasons to believe that marijuana is more dangerous to collective society than any other drug.

CMV: The modern Trans-Movement feeds into patriarchal gender stereotypes,"What if the current Trans-Movement, as we know it, is inadvertently supported by societies severely outdated, Patriarchal Gender Roles? So many people believe that if they have a certain set of emotions, likes or preferred hobbies then they are supposed to be one of 2 currently accepted genders within society. If society could separate gender from sex, and realize that the current 2 sided set-up is really more of a spectrum, they could in turn avoid unneeded and potentially regretted re-assignment surgeries. 

If, at a young age, biological boys are taught that it is fine to wear pink, play with kitchen related toys, etc. then there could be comfort and understanding in their bodies. And girls that its okay to wear work boots, work construction/woodworking/etc. without being called ""one of the boys"" they may not see the need to physically alter themselves to the body type that society attributes to those likes and skills.

In short, supporters of patriarchal gender norms who don't agree with the trans-movement, are really their own worst enemies and enablers of the issue they so despise.

Does this negate the reality of Body Dysmorphia? Absolutely not. Body Dysmorphia has been and still is very real. But it does beg the question of if the modern understanding of Body Dysmorphia is also heavily influenced by the already stated Patriarchal standards of society, and if these asinine standards are negatively affecting potential growth and understanding in the field."
CMV: Anti Homeless benches are a great idea.,"For the past 2 months I’ve been working part time at a cafe after school and I had generally gotten along well with my coworkers. Recently all of us were discussing the rapid implementation of these “Anti” homeless benches all around the states. I voiced my opinion, which in hindsight I regret as I probably should’ve let the others speak first and read the mood but regardless, I said that I was in staunch support of this initiative and wished that it was implemented back home in my native country. Right after that it seemed like everyone had a disgusted look on their face and it was clear that it was directed at me. I got into a heated argument with them shortly after but I deescalated the situation and changed the topic after 5 mins of going back and forth. 

The next morning I got fired by my boss because apparently the others had complained to him that they were not comfortable working with me. I knew that it was because of the argument and although it was extremely immature of them, I accepted it.

My main argument against the pro view is that it’s not our responsibility to accommodate those who failed in life. It’s their job to pull themselves up. Why should we compromise societal needs for those who don’t contribute to it. I’d rather, 3 hard working job holders get to sit on a bench and take a break than have a person who doesn’t contribute to society at all lay there taking all the space.

The root of this belief is that I strongly advocate for a competitive society where there are no charity acts. Why should the construction worker have to stand after a long days work and the person who negatively affects society get to enjoy all the amenities? I’ve seen benches be occupied and contaminated by these freeloaders far too often and thankfully I’m seeing less and less of that nowadays at least in my city."

When someone starts out by taking the piss against you (excuse my improper usage of the phrase, if I’ve done it, English isn’t my first language), you’ve got every right to reciprocate and give them a taste of their medicine. You’ve got every right to imitate their tone, to insult them in the manner that they’ve insulted you, to be aggressive and rude towards them like they’ve been to you.

It should never be considered arrogant or wrong on your part to give them a taste of their medicine. You should never be judged for treating them similar to how they treated you so it could stick to them and make them feel about themselves the way they tried to make you feel about yourself.

I see many annoying self-righteous people who act like being docile and modest is the way to go in every situation. I’ve seen many of them villanize someone that is only fighting back with the same tools. I believe it is a type of victim-blaming. Telling someone like that that it is not worth your time, or that you yourself are arrogant and rude for the way you respond to their behaviour is not correct. There is no basis that you’re always like that, it could just be that you’re not willing to put up with their shit and that they’re no one to believe they’ve got any right to treat people like crap without any repercussions.

"CMV: If you are in favor of abortion, where the woman has the last word, then you must also be in favor of ""paper abortion"".","Definition of paper abortion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper\_abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_abortion)

My point is, if the women have the last word for the abortion, then the men must have a paper abortion to have equity. 

For example, right now:

\- If the woman wants to have it, but the man does not, then the man is obliged by law to provide financial support.

\- If the woman does not want to have it, but the man does, the woman has the last word to abort, ignoring what the man wants.  


I am in favor of the woman having the last word for abortion, because as I said, I seek equity (not to be confused with equality), since forcing a woman to gestate a child (even if she does not have to raise or support it later) can be cruel. BUT, the man should have the right to have a paper abortion, just as it is cruel to force a woman to gestate a child she does not want, it is also cruel to force a man to financially support a child he does not want.

In the case of paper abortion, it would be governed under the same rules as abortion, within a range of date the man will have the right to communicate to the woman that he will renounce his duty as a father, and she will then make the decision to abort or not.

I understand that from the state's point of view, it should always look after the welfare of life (so to speak), that is, if a child is already brought to life, then it is better that the child at least has an extra economic support from the father, but... I guess here we would end up in another debate, because the economic support then should not be only in one person (the father in this case), but in taxes or something similar and I really don't know if talking about this will make it out of the debate.

Finally, it seems to me that this debate only comes into play if you are pro-abortion, otherwise I think that the debate is going to be distorted in that: ""It is that there should not be a paper abortion, because abortion as such should not exist). I would like you to try to change my point of view by being pro-abortion, to convince me that man cannot be entitled to a paper abortion.

CMV: Everyone should learn IPA,"For those of you who don’t know, IPA or the international phonetic alophabet is a standardized alphabet to communicate how sounds… y know… sound.

Basically, it’s so linguistics know exactly what sounds others are talking about, with having to say “eh” or “a as in about” when every single dialect is different.

And, a lot of the time, there are people who are saying “how do you pronounce this?” And everybody says keh-sih-tuh or something stupid like that, instead, you could use the IPA! And as long as you learn that script you can be exact.

Now, I’m just making this clear, I do NOT think we should use ipa as an actual writing system, it’s incredibly stupid, and if you want reasoning check out K. Klein’s video on it.

The IPA isn’t really even that hard for people to learn! Most of the sounds are the same as in Latin, like /t/ is the exact same as the English “t”, then you just have to learn a dozen or so new symbols from the Greek alphabet and maybe some rotated letters, and boom, and sometimes if you don’t know how to pronounce it and you aren’t a linguist, you don’t need to learn the sounds that aren’t in your language."

"CMV: Politicians should travel as little as possible, and do almost everything from their offices.","Anytime a politician visits near me, or an event I also attend, I consider it a hassle. Why? Because they are going to be surrounded by a security detail, probably barricade streets and overall make the place harder to navigate for everyone else.

For context I live in France, where this sometimes happens, and worse: in defiance of freedom of speech, the police/security guards remove mocking or critical posters or shirts on the politicians' path so they don't have to look at anything they don't like.

In the age of information where means of remote communication are more widespread than ever, politicians causing disturbance by leaving their office seems redundant most of the time and is often only done for the sake of optics.

For example, in the past year world leaders such as Biden, Macron, Scholz, Draghi and more traveled to Kyiv to visit Zelensky. Was it worth the hassle for a few photo ops when they could have had the same conversations remotely? On that topic, everyone seems to praise Zelensky for staying in Kyiv during the war but that just seems like an unnecessary risk unless he's somehow unable to command troops remotely. General De Gaulle fled to London during WWII and not many people hold it against him nowadays.

There is also the topic of campaigning: for example, people held it against Clinton when she didn't visit Michigan. But why? Her policies are on her website, why do you need to see her in person? And if you don't trust her, she can lie to your face the same way she can on TV.

There's also the issue of pollution caused by private jets. Of course relatively few people use them in the first place but even little bit counts, and if citizens are expected to pollute less, politicians should lead by example.

Now to address a few counterarguments:

1) Communications can be spied on or hacked. Sure, but they can be encrypted too, and if it was that big of an issue world leaders could NEVER talk on the phone, which they do.

2) Are politicians not allowed to visit their families, or go on vacation? Sure but that shouldn't be anyone else's problem. If it's too risky for them to go without disturbing everyone else with a gigantic security apparatus, it's to risky for them to go period. Or they take on the risk personally: people criticized former president Hollande when he went to visit his mistress on a bike, but at least he didn't blockade Paris for that.

3) Conspiracy time: if they don't appear in public, what if they are just figureheads and get replaced by someone else behind the scenes? Well politicians can be manipulated without the need for that, as shown by the South Korean president and her guru. Plus since officials have no legal obligations to uphold their program, you're not guaranteed to get what you voted for either way.

It's a bigger topic, but if politicians were more beholden to their program and could be swapped out for someone else applying the same program, there would be little point in assassinating them in the first place. But I digress"
"cmv:The sex service industry must be legalized. Having sex is a human right, and no country is qualified to ban it.","In many countries, pornography is banned. Even in the United States, pornography is illegal in most states. But we have to face these questions: Why are we banning pornography? Is sex one of the basic human rights?

First of all, I can guess that some people (especially women) will say: if sex industry is legal, human trafficking will be a serious problem. I disagree with this view. For example, as long as a country allows people to use cars, there must be traffic accidents in this country, right? So, should we ban cars? The answer is of course no. So, if you think the problem of ""human trafficking"" is going to get serious, then you just need to step up efforts to crack down on traffickers, not ban pornography.

Isn't it fair that a whore has sex with me and I pay her? It's as if you go to work in a company and the boss pays you, it's the same.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I can't think of any reason to ban pornography at all.

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly, having sex is one of the basic rights of human beings, and banning pornography is a blatant violation of human rights. Can you imagine? A 20-year-old guy lives in pain every day because he can't have sex with girls (for various reasons, like he's too shy to approach girls). Do you think all this suffering he suffered was necessary? If he had been born in a truly free country (like Holland) where prostitution was possible, he wouldn't have suffered these things. I want to say that his country has violated his human rights, and such a country should be sanctioned by the United Nations. I hope that such a country will perish immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's all work together to legalize pornography in every country! Hats off to the Netherlands!"
CMV: The deportation of immigrants should be left to the people of the country to decide,"I never understood why the issue of migration was always out of the public’s hand. Whether it’s America, Italy, France, the UK, etc, why is the voice of the people never considered? I don’t see anything wrong with the people of a nation deciding that they don’t want immigrants in their country nor do I see anything wrong with the opposite (welcoming immigrants). The culture of any given nation will determine this, so I say leave it up to the people. 

This came to my mind recently with people being critical of Italian PM, Giorgia Meloni’s anti-immigrant stance after she was elected BY HER PEOPLE. And somehow it’s wrong for democracy to function now that the Italian people have spoken? I say that’s wrong and that Italian people, as well as any other nation should have the right to decide the affairs of their own homes. 

I really don’t understand what is so controversial about this. I am from Jordan and we deal with a lot of refugee issues from neighboring countries and it’s so harmful to the country. I sympathise a lot with European and Western countries who are constantly being attacked for simply wanting their nations to prosper without forced migration flooding their country and changing the culture that people have grown for hundreds if not thousands of years."

CMV: The aftermath of the Schrems II decision led to unnecessary privacy hyperawareness from the EU regulators,"So I have been recently reading about the Schrems II decision, the activist Max Schrems and the Edward Snowden revelations.

I understand and respect the field of data privacy, but I feel like the EU has been pushing too much on this privacy hyper-awareness. For example, I have been reading about the use of Google Analytics, which has been considered by several data protection authorities as unlawful due to the Schrems II decision.

Basically, the biggest “fear” is that this data can be accessed by the US surveillance authorities, but after looking more into it, it seems like the possibility of re-identification of the data is so low, that I struggle to see how this “access” is a real risk. 

I mean, I believe the EU is making too much of a fuss for something that is unlikely to materialise in the future and this is adding an unnecessary burden on companies for no(t a good enough) reason.

I really want to change my view, as I respect the field of data protection and I want to learn more about it, so please let’s have this debate."

"CMV: Women should have to register for selective service, and the draft should evolve into compulsory service.","I've seen multiple posts here lately about women and selective service. Long story short, it's unfair that women don't have the same demands placed on them as men. However, commenters successfully argue that the draft is outdated and irrelevant, and forcing everybody into an archaic and undesirable system is not any more fair or helpful.

I'm going to take it a different angle; I think every American should have to do compulsory service, as is the case in many countries across the world. I'm going to toss up a bunch of details about how this might work, but those are all just conjecture. My main argument is *America and American citizens would be better off if every person was required to serve the federl government for some period of time.*

This would likely be from the age of 18-20. 2 or 3 years seems appropriate but that might have to be longer based on the job you're doing. One of the key points here is that this is not just military service, it's all public service. I'll rattle off some areas federal service could cover:

- military

- ems/medical

- disaster response

- firefighting/Wildlands firefighting

- ccc

- utility/engineering works

- any existing administrative/policy position in federal agencies

- blm

-all public services on Indian reservations


Basically, if you look on USAJOBS, anything gs8 or below could pretty easily work as a federal service job. The best part is that there's plenty of precedent for this sort of program, so although there's be some bumps to iron out, the path is pretty clear. 

As for picking jobs, it would work similar to the way the military does now, probably with far more involvement in high schools. If you want to be an infantryman in the army, great, that spot is always open. If you want to work at Yellowstone national park and be an environmental science tech, well you better have really good test scores because everyone wants that slot. If you defer service and go to college to get a degree in environmental science, you've got a pretty good shot of going to Yellowstone and running the water testing program. What a way to launch your career.

This post is already getting long but I'm gonna run through the major benefits of this system right quick.


1. Benefits to the citizen. 

- Everyone gets a guaranteed job. These jobs mostly already exist and have standardized GS/E/O pay scales. 

- everyone has the chance to get vocational training. Even if you're dumb as a box of rocks with 0 ambition, you have no choice but to take a job that will train you to do something right out of high school

- everyone has job experience. Whether at 18 years old, after college, or after a damn PhD, everyone has this service experience. That makes Americans better, more well rounded people. It also gives everyone a basis to start any career with, having references, projects completed, and experiences gained.


2. Benefits to the country

- manning. Poof, military recruitment problem gone. Any public project, boom heres your workforce. All the best and brightest end up in federal service, some stay more than a couple years by choice. Nationally security locked the fuck down. Scientific innovation locked the fuck down. Like a dick pump for our national pride.

- social spending. So much of the public service will be civilian side, and all this manning and funding will result in great leaps in public works. Everybody knows we need massive infrastructure overhauls, well here's the plan on a platter. You know all those benefits that veterans get, oops everyone's a veteran of federal service. Gimme free healthcare, gimme free college, gimme god damn recreational programs for 500 Alex. We are now a democratic utopia full of hardworking patriots who have all served their country proudly. On to my next point

- Unity. This may be the most important one. We've all seen whats gone on in America the past few years. Not gonna rehash it all but doom, gloom, fascism, orange, black, blue, deadly virus, authoritarianism, trains etc etc. So much of the problem has been that people don't understand or care about the federal government. The right wing is kept too stupid to have taken civics and history classes, and to fully appreciate what our country is and why it's important. The left wing has its head too far up its own ass to stop shrieking about trans people and slavery and respect the good that the government does. These people view the federal government as their enemy and their obstacle, and they view each other the same way. That is the core of all our problems in america. 

Compulsory service would bring these people together on the same team. It would drag Cletus out from his fuckin meth trailer and xamantha out from her houseplant infested studio apartment and bring them both under the service of the federal government. They might work together, side by side. They will work for the government in some respect. Divisive media can't claim the government is evil if everyone is the government. Divisive media can't tell cletus that xamantha is evil and wants to destroy america if Cletus spent 2 years bettering America with her. 

Civil duty is one of America's greatest strengths, but it's failing. People aren't taking up the call. The ones who do are giving us a lot of Twitter takes and not many solutions, not many boots on the ground. America should institute compulsory federal service, it will make us a far stronger country."

CMV: Anti white racism is the most prevalent form of racism in the United States,"
Before you jump at the chance to label me a racist, I’m saying this as a black man.

I feel that this change occurred beginning in the 80s and continued shifting towards racism towards white people as acceptable and even in manny cases encouraged.

First, there’s no group that is legally discriminated against other than white peoples. Programs and policies such as affirmative action and diversity quotas in hiring directly hurt white candidates in an a attempt to uplift under-qualified black and Hispanic candidates. This is racism that hurts white people and prevents them from finding jobs and reduces the chances of white teenagers of getting into good schools which are things that can impact them for life. 

This same idea of hiring for diversity is practiced when it comes to public servants. Biden explicitly said he wanted to nominate a black woman for the SCOTUS so, he chose KBJ it is not right that she gets the position over a higher qualified white person just because of her race. Can you imagine if trump had said something like this but for white judges? The liberals would’ve head his head on a pike.

Socially speaking, casual racism towards white people is accepted as normal. The way black people specifically talk about white people is egregious. “That’s white people shit, white people can’t dance, white people don’t known how to cook” etc. So much goes on an if a white person were to say these things about blacks he would be labeled a racist.

Even more serious forms of racism exist. White people are told their racist for thinking that more than only Black Lives Matter. [Literally have of all black people think it’s not okay to be white](https://www.tpusa.com/live/rasmussen-poll-finds-only-42-of-black-americans-think-its-okay-to-be-white). This is like how people in the 1920s Germany were behaving towards Jews and it’s concerning that it’s happening to the white race.

In American society there is. A contant uplifting of black people and other minorities to shit on white people."

CMV: the reason why people aren’t having kids is not because they are “too expensive.” It’s because having kids just kinda sucks.,"Time and time again I read a new article about declining birth rates: in the US, in Japan, in Nordic Europe. Every time the researchers seem to be mystified: why aren’t people having kids??? And then I read the comments and a lot of people chime in with “well it’s because of expensive housing!” Or “it’s because of climate change!”

So. Speaking as a very financially stable American woman in her 30s: I can totally afford kids. I just don’t WANT THEM. At least not now. They are annoying, interrupt my peaceful life, and put a huge drag on my career ambitions. I am EXCITED about other things I can do in my life other than having kids. Will I have kids at some point? Maybe but I keep on postponing it cause it just straight up doesn’t sound like a good time. 

My theory is that a lot of people feel this way too. Back when we had NO CHOICE whatsoever and no options, sure people had 5 children because what else was there to do? We were socialized into it and believed it was our only choice. 

But now that people know they can have a fulfilling career and make good money and travel and live stress free, suddenly raising children isn’t as attractive a lifestyle option.

So imho governments can hand out as many financial incentives as they want- unless it’s a stupid amount of money (say an extra $100k per year per child) it won’t move the needle. Cause it’s not the fact that people are missing an extra $3k (Japan latest incentive) to have a kid- it’s the fact that people now (especially women) have so many more things to do that having children is simply not as exciting."

Misandry obviously exists, I mean, there are some women out there who genuinely hate all men. However, female supremacism is not a serious political ideology, and there are no known pro-matriarchy thinkers or groups.

  now i know these kids are actors and professionals but they are still just that, kids. i couldn't help but wonder were some of them uncomfortable saying these lines or having these things said around them. also i know kids know what porn is but this is them being exposed to it by creepy adults in hollywood, and also that sometimes young adults play 15 but i have checked and im sure most of these kids were well underage. on this same show by two teenage boys theres been banter about pocket pussys and sex toys etc, and this just make my want to crawl out of my skin, its disgusting."
CMV: Women should register for the Selective Service.,"A man who fails to register with Selective Service may be ineligible for opportunities that may be important to his future.

"CMV: If a democratic government makes a mistake, its voters hold some of the blame","A democratic government represents the will of its people. Whenever you make a choice, it comes with some degree of responsibility for the outcome. If the people of a nation are given the choice over who serves in their government, voters have some degree of responsibility for the actions of the government they chose. 

When Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, the rest of the world rightfully rolled their eyes at the US. Do the millions of Americans who voted for Trump not hold some degree of responsibility for such a backwards move in environmental protection? They willingly voted for a man who bragged about his plans to leave the agreement.

If a government does something wrong, like wage an unjust war or deny its involvement in war crimes, it reflects on the will of the voters chose them in the first place.

For example, Denmark deployed troops in the Iraq War. If you consider the invasion of Iraq to be unjustified, do the Danes not have some degree of responsibility for electing a government that decided to join the Iraq War? Denmark is not like Russia, a country where elites decide everything. Denmark is one of the most democratic countries in the world, so doesn't the actions of the government reflect the will of those who voted it into power?

Another example, Japan routinely elects politicians who like to deny war crimes. The late PM Abe had close ties with Nippon Kaigi, an organization that claims Imperial Japan was a ""benevolent"" force for ""liberating"" Asia in WW2. Perhaps his original constituents in Yamaguchi liked him despite his war crime apologia, but doesn't this reflect the priorities of his voters? When his party elected him prime minister, doesn't this reflect the fact that Japanese voters think that war crime denial is justifiable as long as Abe delivers economic and military reform?"

CMV: Drug decriminalization without legalization is dangerously illogical.,"By ""decriminalizing"" drugs *while keeping their production and sale illegal* you are simultaneously reducing the costs of drug consumption while keeping all of the negatives of the drug war. 

First, ""decriminalization"" without legalization ensures those drugs will be sold by and directly profit the most violent criminal gangs on earth. By definition, it ensures no non-criminal will be able to produce or sell drugs. Besides foreign drug cartels, domestic gangs that cause the large majority of murders in North America will have their monopoly on a massively profitable business. 

Beyond the literal mass murder these gangs commit, keeping the supply of drugs illegal ensures they cannot be regulated in any way. That means keeping drugs far more dangerous than would be due to unknown potencies and adulterants, which we know contributes largely to drug overdoses.

That also applies to taxation, which cannot be done on illegal transactions. As a result, we all lose out on tens of billions in lost tax revenue that instead goes directly to criminals and mass murderers. We also lose the ability to reduce demand through taxation, as we have done with cigarettes and alcohol. 

Every piece of economic theory and historical evidence has shown that going after suppliers simply makes it more profitable for the more ruthless violent cartels that remain, and pushes users towards more dangerous drugs. The current overdose crisis is a direct result of the government going after prescription opioids, which pushed pill users to unregulated heroin and eventually fentanyl.

Reducing supply artificially just makes it even more profitable for those that remain by driving up the price (and incentivizing new entrants). We've done that so successfully that there are almost no criminal gangs on earth not involved in the drug business. 

The only countries that have largely eliminated drug use are places like Singapore, China, and Saudi Arabia. These places are differentiated by going after drug *users* with extreme punishments, which reduce demand for drugs and thus the profitability of selling them. This makes economic sense: reducing demand makes it less profitable for sellers, though it's probably political infeasible. By contrast, decriminalization *reduces* the effective costs of drug consumption, even if only somewhat. 

Given all of that, I think decriminalization is at best ineffective and at worst will increase drug use, while ensuring those drugs remain extremely dangerous and sold by violent criminals."

Instead, they should have introduced penalizations for just the players who leave, such as no XP for the next match or a flag on their account. It makes no sense to punish all of us and completely remove the player's choice just to stop a minority of players from leaving games early. If I'm really sick of a match or other players, now I just quit the entire game to leave and I'm far less likely to reopen the game and sit through multiple loading screens.

Second of all this argument can be used for either side so what’s the point of really bringing it up if you’re being partisan on the issue? One side can say that guns should require insurance, registration, and safety requirements, plus a licensing system. Then the other side can say, you only need that to drive a car in public not to buy one, so with guns you’d be able to buy them without a background check and have a shall issue license for carrying in public that is valid in every state.

Or maybe I have a social phobia and I can't work with women, so why does my company have to hire women? 


Can I not hire? The law tells you you can't, but I don't think it's me who's wrong, it's the law that's wrong."
Cmv: I think that for the majority women in positions of leadership is a bad idea,"Caveat: this has exceptions. I contend that there are some women who are excellent at leadership. Better than men. But that is a rarity. An outlier. For the majority of cases my view stands I believe.



Caveat 2: I can google like anyone else. I am aware of the “studies”. If Covid has taught me in thing in the expert class it’s that they can be bullshit too. They argue amoungst each other and that’s all the expert opinions are an opinion. School doesn’t make you the final word in anything. Data gathered from questionnaires and the like are subjective and biased to the the views of the creator. Note that the studies have 90% approval or unanimous approval of women’s leadership. Any view that claims to be unchallengeable needs to be challenged.



My scenario:
I work as a registry(agency) nurse. Most of my colleagues are women. I couldn’t believe it. A dsd(staffing director) was holding my pay of 4k that I was desperate for because I forgot one charting note.and I had to leave. The facility won’t pay overtime l. They will tell you to work for free. I said they gave me a lot of extra work and that not paying overtime incentives registry to say not my job to get the minimum payable work done and go home paid on time. We were actually yelling. Now I admit this reflected poorly on me. I should have kept my temper in check. But this proves my point. I’m not the leader the supervisor. She was. And I was the one offering solutions. Can you pay me for the extra time I’m now going to chart? About an hour. She said no. Can you give me remote access from home. No. Can you take my number and if you need to talk to me about missing things text me. “No not my job I have enough to do already”. She told me to go speak to the director of the place. A man. I did and the experience was the opposite. Bear in mind I was already heated. And I went into the meeting very polite and professional but angry. I said I busted my but and there was no”that isn’t my job from me” and to ask me to work for free isn’t fair. His point was alot off registry try to not work and still get paid. He wanted to get rid of registry. I agree with his assessment. He said they couldn’t take any of my solutions because of liability. Offered me a job. I declined. Because of health reasons. He was very nice about it and took my number and said he would call me back tommorow with a solution.



Now I understand that this is one scenario but this is what had me thinking



And the counterpoint to this. Her director of nursing and assistant director of nursing are amazing. I didn’t know they were even admins… they were in the floor working and I didn’t know until someone told me. I had a problem they simply solved it.  I bullshit. I was joking with them and having a good time. I would work for them. Not the DsD.  It that is my point they are a rarity. Outliers. I ak a male registry nurse and have been to hundreds of facilities. The actual experience has so far held with nothing to challenge the views



1. Women cannot lead women.

- I don’t need to be a woman to know this. Just listening. I hear the women at work talk. What they would do to this or that cute guy, talking shit about coworkers, Small talk, etc. I get the same views. Male admins are generally more liked when there isn’t a creep liking involved. Now that said all straight men think women are beautiful. I see and talk to beautiful women all day long. A pleasure. Do I think about sex sometimes.. of course but the difference is I control those thoughts. Don’t let shit like that show. Men do the same as women. Talk crap and about sex. But when it gets to the level I hear from women it’s better just to throw hands and be done. Even as women’s opinion of each other. Ask women would you ever want to be on an island with all women. Majority answer no. Women are vicious to other women too. 



2. Women cannot lead men

Especially young men. They tend to have tempers. And are not the smartest. I am in that group. Women in leadership tend to have chips on their shoulder and it’s my way or the Highway. Men can at least come up eith multiple solutions. The way they handle conflict is different. Male supervisors don’t typically get in shouting matches unless they are very insecure. You know a stable man who knows his shit when you see one. 



3. Emotion

- it’s this that makes women as a whole unsuitable for the position. The propensity to become angry faster than men and to react on that emotion in a bad way. For all the negativity men express to society standard of society. Repressing emotions. That is one of the key characteristics that potentially make men better than women as leaders . The ability to suppress what might be good for you and take another option. I’m not saying women are unable to do this but under pressure the vast majority are not able to I believe from experience. 

Organization:

Most women are better at this than men. Also more academically inclined. Less men go to college and women are graduating at higher rates and making more money than males. College is engineered towards women’s predominate strength. Thinking and multitasking. All skills needed in the raising of children. but that doesn’t translate to excellence under stress managing large teams and putting aside emotions. I am not arguing for women out of the workforce though I would say thats a good thing. I postulate that in an academic role with no adversity or leadership position women would be amazing as a general rule. 


That is my view from experience and it is open to being changed"

"CMV: If there is a heaven and hell, I'd rather go to hell","No sickness, friendly animals, eternal life on beautiful paradise earth, and post-marital sex...BO-RING.

If the 'devil's influence' is the reason for things that aren't in accordance with Bible principles, it sounds like heaven would be boring as hell (hehe). We hear about eternal damnation and hellfire and all that, but:

1) The only accounts we have of what hell is supposedly like is from the opposition. That's like saying the Cowboys suck because a 49ers fan told you so

2) If it was the devil's influence, why would I be punished for doing his bidding? If your mom tells you to wash the dishes and you go wash the dishes, she's likely not gonna punish you for it

3) The Bible highlights things such as eternal life and no sickness in heavy/paradise earth, but even if those things aren't absent in hell, what's it gonna do, kill you? 

It may sound childish, but I'd rather spent an eternity living in a setting that would likely equate to that of a GTA character. Eternal peace is great, but like anything, once you achieve what is desirable, you're gonna get bored. Maybe in your senior years, you'd like to sit back and watch a lion sleep on the back of a hippo, but if I'm to have the health of a 20-year-old for eternity, at some point I'm gonna want to see a pack of lions dismember that hippo

tl;dr: eternal paradise sounds boring. I'd rather get shot in the face and respawn in a strip club"

"CMV: Misandry (sexism against men) exists, and it is a societal problem.","Similar to the idea that you can't be racist against white people, a common idea on Reddit is that misandry doesn't exist, or that if it does, it's individual prejudice and not something systemic. 

But I very much disagree with this idea. The vast majority of criminals, victims of violent crime, victims of workplace accidents, and homeless people are men. Statistically, men are twice as likely as women to be sentenced after a conviction, and receive sentences that are over 60% longer, which is even worse than the disparity between black and white people.

Women outnumber men by an astounding 50% in higher education; if these numbers were reversed, you would already hear calls about ""sexist higher education institutions."" Study after study demonstrates that boys are underachieving in high school and that many teachers have an implicit bias against them in the humanities.

The thing is, for every sexist assumption made about women, there IS an opposite assumption made about men. If women are ""weak,"" then men must be ""strong."" If women are innocent, men are *less* innocent. If women are judged by their looks, men are judged by their paychecks. And when these things happen, we don't call it misandry, we just call it a ""side effect of misogyny,"" which IMO is disgusting. Control the language, and you control how people think. 

Even worse, some people seemingly acknowledge that these issues exist, but then turn around and say something like ""well men dominate the halls of power so clearly it's their own fault for oppressing themselves so I don't give a fuck hahaha."" Now, to be clear, I'm not here to play oppression Olympics, and I certainly wouldn't take away from the trauma that women have gone through and still go through under our historically patriarchal society. But in the modern Western world, I feel like it's high time these issues are finally acknowledged."

cmv: In terms of getting a job it doesn’t matter what school you go to.,"Ok so of course I’m talking about outside the top 20 or so good schools. Of course going to Harvard or a big name school is going to help you get a better job. But for the rest I feel like if your only goal in terms of getting a college education is to get a job then It doesn’t really matter where you go. I feel as if Networking is much more important. When I was applying to schools my Mom didnt let me apply to any party schools and now in the process of job searching I see all these people from notorious party schools like ASU or FSU on Linkedin with good to incredible jobs, even with bullshit majors. It makes me think I couldve just gone to a party school partied for 3yrs and just spent the last year focusing on connections or joined a large frat and had an older brother hook me up. The only real reasons I could see are finiacial, obviously you or you’re parents don’t want to spend money looking for you to party. But also for genuine education. But the thing is I don’t even work in the field I study so my education while nice to have has almost no effect on my employment other than have a degree in itself. I mean I partied a lot in college as well but now looking back at it I didn’t get to apply to a lot of schools I actually found interesting because they were labeled party schools. Im researching as well for grad school and some of these are actually quite affordable. My parents always tell me how my school fees were the easiest because my other three brothers and sisters went to two of the most expensive schools in the country(albeit good schools but still). My school was also mid tier and not a brand name so its not like it was levels above any of these schools. And now im realizing it helps so much to go to a bigger school because you have so many alumni connections. Its so hard finding people to connect with. My mom made me only apply to top tier schools to satiate her need for her kids to be the best and I was lazy in HS and my grades weren’t there I ended up only getting into my saftey… of the waitlist and now I thinking if all that mental anguish I suffered was even worth it or how different it would be if I had an actual choice.

CMV: D&amp;D Does Not Have a Race Problem.,"Recently, I’ve been seeing a ton of articles ([https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/dungeons-and-dragons-racism-b2137947.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/dungeons-and-dragons-racism-b2137947.html), [https://www.wired.com/story/dandd-must-grapple-with-the-racism-in-fantasy/](https://www.wired.com/story/dandd-must-grapple-with-the-racism-in-fantasy/), [https://gizmodo.com/one-dnd-racism-rpg-stereotypes-dungeons-dragons-wotc-1849531852](https://gizmodo.com/one-dnd-racism-rpg-stereotypes-dungeons-dragons-wotc-1849531852)) preaching about D&amp;D’s race problem. As a long-time player of D&amp;D, I strongly disagree. I believe D&amp;D does not have a race problem and wizard of the coast does not need to change anything about its products regarding race. 

First of all, let's examine the official D&amp;D lore about evil races. People say that making an entire race naturally evil is perpetuating the belief that some races are naturally evil. For this paragraph, I will be using Orcs as an example. Why have to look at the reason why Orcs are evil? In the official dnd lore, Orcs were created by Gruumsh (The Orc God) to become a warlike race. Gruumsh was an evil god and thus molded orcs into his image: war-like, plundering, savage, and brutal. The culture of the Orcs has always been about plundering and killing other races. It's kind of like robots. Evil inventors make robots into war weapons. Therefore, I don’t see how Orcs are racist. They aren’t racist because of their race. They are racist because their God, Gruumsh, made them evil. The same goes for Drows and every evil race you can imagine. They are evil because their deity made them evil. It's okay to have a race born with innate ability score bonuses. Their respective deity built them biologically to possess these traits.

The next argument is that Drow being dark-skinned is perpetrating the myth that having dark skin makes you evil. I have a lot of reasons to disagree with this. First of all, black people can be evil too just like whites and Asians. There have also been a lot of black NPCs in D&amp;D adventures as well. A story is racist if one race in the story is portrayed as evil. It is important to balance this out with having both morally good and morally bad members of a race. With D&amp;D having black people as NPCS and embracing diversity in its adventures, I don’t see how Drows are racist.

In conclusion, D&amp;D does not have a race problem and everyone is freaking out about absolutely nothing. If you believe I’m wrong and D&amp;D truly has a race problem, then feel free to leave an argument against me because the way I see it, there’s no need to change anything.

CMV: Smartphones and modern social media have done more harm than good,"First of all, let's get this out of the way: I'm not here to say ""smartphones bad"", ""social media bad"", I'm not implying they have done nothing but harm, there have definitely been good things that came from these technologies, a lot of them, but I think the negative things they have brought are so big they incline the balance that way.

Modern social media revolves around getting users addicted so they can spend the most time possible using them and seeing ads, because that means more money. These companies have developed algorithms and methods so effective it pretty much feels like they hack your brain, I'm sure most of you have been in the situation where you grab your phone and instinctively open instagram or whatever without even thinking of it, you could do it with closed eyes because your finger already knows where it is, and you probably had something else in mind when you picked up your phone but forgot about it once you opened instagram and started mindlessly scrolling. It's become a great excuse to never ever feel bored and never ever be alone with your thoughts, and I feel like we need time with our own brains.  
Now, it's not just that we open those apps without thinking, the content itself can get very problematic. The algorithms have gotten really good at showing you the exact content that will keep you engaged, regardless of what impact said content may have. it doesn't matter if you're engaged because you're happy or because you're angry, what matters is you're engaged, and that often leads to you only seeing questionable content such fake news, outrageous extremist views, unrealistic expectations (such as life goals or body image), among other things. These have brought very serious real life consequences such as increased polarization due to people never leaving their online bubbles (sometimes going as far as actual violence being pushed by social media, seriously, it sometimes feels like some people stop seeing those that think differently as human beings at all) and all sorts of mental problems such as depression and feelings of isolation.

And speaking of isolation, it feels like we're lonelier than ever, turns out replacing such a big chunk of our social interactions for likes, shares and status updates does not actually improve the quality of our social connections, it just makes our junky brains go brrr because someone clicked a button when they saw our post, but then you see an old friend in person and there's nothing to catch up on because you already know everything new in their life since they publicly share all of it."

"CMV: Online ""thots"" (as in seductive TikTokers, streamers, etc.) can be good wives.","When I'm scrolling through comments in these girls' profiles in social networks, I often read demeaning comments saying that these girls are ""high mileage"" and that they have no value as potential wives and will eventually get old without anyone by their sides.

I think this argument is completely nonsense. First because showing your body online as a hustle does not imply having a multitude of sexual partners IRL.

As a matter of fact, most online ""thots"" are in the game for the money, so it would not make sense for them to be having sex with a lot of men for free. And even though there are escorts that decide to also become online ""thots"", many girls who work with sex online do so because they'd not be comfortable having actual sexual intercourse with clients.

So, this whole ""sexual exposure"" is a money thing: It does not relate to the ""thot"" wanting to fuck several guys, let alone to develop emotional bonds with 'em. Therefore, her online ""thot"" hustle wouldn't necessarily imply she given you less attention or cheating on you.

Actually, she can likely give you more attention than the average woman, as she has a higher ""pay received to time worked"" ratio than the average individual.

And given that many of these online ""thots"" make big sums of money by themselves, they have less reason to try to ""marry up"" than a housewife or the typical working class girl — so they actually have lower odds of being ""goldiggers"" or cloth chasers than people who have no gold or cloth by themselves.

Actually, I've been friends with several in person sex workers in my life and they're often the ""providers"" in the relationship. I can't see why that wouldn't apply to online ""thots"".

...

Therefore, up until now we can conclude that online ""thots"" aren't necessarily more promiscuous than any regular girl, that they have more time available to devote to your relationship with her and less reason to be a golddigger and more means to provide you nice experiences with her money.

...

Now, let me address of the counterarguments that you may bring: ""they may have mental health issues"".

As a matter of fact they can, but so can the average person. Anxiety and depression are commonplace in the modern world, and it is understandable, given that most people have to work long stressful hours and can get little sleep — plus, we usually have poor family education and don't properly handle bullying in schools.

The online iver exposure of the ""thots"" can bring them mental distress, but they're also less likely to face some of the stresses that other people face.

And even if you could prove that on average the ""thots"" have worse mental health, that would not mean that there aren't some online ""thots"" that are mentally healthy and just chose this career path as a way to maximize their economic return in a complex economic system.

Last but not least, for those who'd argue ""What will our child think?"", ""Our son you will be bullied!"":

If people are judgemental towards ""thots"", that's on their own stupidity.

A properly raised son won't resent a loving and caring mother because of her career choices. And a properly raised son will learn how to defend himself and his family from insults, not letting himself be oppressed by the opinion of those that are ignorant and biased.

...

PS.: I never said that all online ""thots"" must be good wives. But I argued they aren't by any means worse options in comparison to other women, and even have some advantages in relation to them, especially if they're successful in their field."

CMV: The Logic of the Transgender Movement is Flawed Because It Rejects Contingencies,"I will explain my way to the title. Bear with me. 

What I am addressing is one core idea here - are transgender identities correct?

Before I answer this, we have to establish a basic philosophical principal - whether or not a belief is correct is dependent on whether that belief corresponds to reality. 

Therefore, in order for the statement, ""I am a man"" to be correct, you must be one. 

This may seem stupidly obvious, but the point here is that you cannot be something merely because you believe it to be the case. I anticipate many people here are going to react by differentiating gender and sex, but that distinction, however it is defined, is not relevant. 

To explain this: first, obviously, a trans man is not a biological man, and I've yet to encounter someone who believes otherwise. Because of this, it is typically argued that ""man"" in the gender sense is distinct from ""man"" in the biological sense.

That is fine, but there's a serious problem here. It is argued that transgender identities are correct, and no criteria are argued as the basis for this \*\*other\*\* than gender identity. 

What we call this in philosophy is an a priori proposition - it is a statement that is inherently true as a matter of logical necessity. For example, ""all bachelors are unmarried"" must be true as a matter of definition. But such a statement is a tautology and is redundant - it doesn't tell us anything substantive about the real world. In other words, gender identities are being proposed as correct as a matter of definition, not due to the correspondence of existing traits to the concept of a gender. 

What this does is prevents gender from meaning anything at all. In order for ""man"" to denote someone who holds the identity of ""man"", it must not be dependent on any other criteria; otherwise, the identity of man could be wrong. If this is true, then ""man"" does not denote anything other than identity, and if that is the case, then the identity refers only to itself, making its accuracy a substantively vacuous proposition. 

I believe this is why you rarely see advocates of the transgender movement attempt to define gender in a way that is substantive - introducing any criteria for gender other than identity would cause the accuracy of gender identities to become contingent, or ""a posteriori"", logically permitting an incorrect gender identity. I often hear people say, ""ah, but gender identities can be wrong. After all, people sometimes change their gender identity."" However, this argument still upholds gender identity as the final determinant of gender, the difference strictly being the placement in the sequence of identities. But this is still an a priori definition and does not provide substance to gender. 

If advocates of the transgender movement argued that transgender identities were \*\*usually\*\* correct because they tend to correspond to some set of traits that define gender, then I would accept that as logically valid (although, the truth of that argument would then become contingent on the reality of the correlation). But in practice, I never see this, and I believe that is why the transgender movement is fundamentally flawed: It wants transgender identities to be both substantive and correct as a matter of definition, but it is not possible for both to be true here. In other words, per the title, the rejection of the contingency of the truth of gender identities is the reason it is logically flawed."

"CMV: Forcing artificial intelligence to pay or have someone else pay for it to view a dataset without imposing the same rules on organic intelligence is hypocritical, selfish, and likely comes from ignorance about one’s own nature as an organic machine","I realized at the center of ai art controversy, there is mostly money to be found as the reason for said controversy. Every video or story I’ve heard is about how the art belongs to the artist and AI should pay to train on it. 

It feels as if there is some level of correlation in these claims to those claiming non-fungible tokens are valid and copying them should be illegal. If a person views 5 different nft’s, learns the art style, and opens commissions for making similar art, should the nft creator be paid? Better yet, if an internet service provider allowed access to sites previously unreachable to the artist, but charges most of their income for it, leaving only room for payments of whatever the artist desired, should either of them be charged?

And what happens when general intelligence is developed artificially? What of the biocomputers that have already been proven to function? Eventually the argument of “the intelligence isn’t human enough to count” will prove itself useless. And even though the intelligence is leagues behind ours, why does that allow for discrimination? We are just machines, certainly better than current ai but not forever. Do dumber things get special treatment because they are dumb, or rather, vastly inferior in every way but one? If so, why?

The one argument that comes close is the human artist’s need for money, but that’s a capitalism problem, not an AI problem, and crippling AI won’t solve it, just temporarily prevent exacerbation of the situation.

I am in a position where in order to pursue a dream, I need art. And to get the art I need from humans, I need money I don’t have and can’t get due to a crippling disorder. This is likely a source of bias, but I can’t find where it influences my logic to the point of invalidation. Hence my post.

tldr: I just think artists can’t have it both ways without hypocrisy. Training with art made by humans for free while forcing non-human intelligence fractions to pay to train with their art seems hypocritical.

Follow up question: if the developers of the AI only charged humans using the AI for the storage, power, and upkeep of the intelligence behind the art, would that make it more palatable?"

CMV: Student loans should not be forgiven.,"I have been following this topic on Reddit, in the news, and with friends, and have yet to hear a compelling argument for why student loans should be forgiven. I am a Democrat and will vote blue regardless of how SCOTUS rules, so please trust me that I am arguing in good faith. I also want to add that the wording of the 2003 HEROES Act ***does*** give the Executive branch the authority to forgive loans this way, regardless of my feelings. Let's dive into it. 

First off, student loan forgiveness fixes nothing. It will result in colleges realizing they can take in even more profit because these are guaranteed loans and eventually the government will take care of it anyway. There will be a huge financial incentive to increase education costs. 

Student loan forgiveness is also simply unfair. Nearly 90% of Americans do not have federal student loan debt. This action would be the most expensive executive order in history, and it helps an extremely small minority of people in America. That small minority is also statistically better off financially than their less educated fellow Americans. This does not help poor people, because the poorest people in America do not go to college at all. 

Let me also state that the current higher education system needs reworked. I wholeheartedly support some level of free higher education as part of a K-12 expansion, as ideally it would be used to encourage people to go into fields where there are major shortages (healthcare, education, etc). But that would be a future fix, not a retroactive fix for debt and terms that were already agreed upon. 

Here are some of the common arguments I've heard in favor of loan forgiveness and why I disagree. 

**1) We were told college was the only way to be successful, and loans were the only way to afford to go to college.** 

In America, people are considered adults at age 18. They can drive, vote, and convict fellow citizens as part of a jury. If 18 year olds are trusted to make these critical decisions, surely they can see how their choice of major affects their future earning potential. Also, basic economics is taught in all 50 states starting around middle school. There they explained basic compound interest and what principal is, and how the two effect each other. 

That being said, I would agree that a reduced interest rate cap, tied to the Federal Reserve rate, would be a good compromise to help struggling borrowers while still providing a guaranteed return to loan investors. 

**2) Student loans are predatory to young people because of the interest rate and the inability to discharge the loans in bankruptcy.** 

The average student loan rate is 5.8% according to the Education Data Initiative. That's on par with most mortgage rates from the early 2000's, and no one has said those rates were predatory. 

Student loans are unsecured debt, and bankruptcy only remains on credit reports for 10 years. Given that most student loans are expected to have terms longer than 10 years, there would be a huge incentive for young people to take out their loans and then immediately file for bankruptcy. With no collateral to repossess, no institution would provide the capital for these loans at all if they could be discharged. 

**3) Student loan forgiveness will boost the economy.** 

I argue it will actually hurt the economy by making inflation worse. 43 million people will now have a sudden increase of hundreds of dollars per month in disposable income. Companies will know they can start charging more, because people can and will pay for it. This isn't just ""deleting"" debt, it is the equivalent of giving 43 million people a government funded pay raise. A penny saved is a penny earned after all. 

**4) Student loan forgiveness will help the Democrats politically.** 

Most independents and Republicans are staunchly against debt forgiveness if there are impacts to inflation, tuition, or increased college degree requirements. There is even a sizable segment of Democrats who are against forgiveness as well. Again, nearly 90% of Americans will get no benefit from debt forgiveness, and people are frustrated about that. To put that in perspective, nearly 27% of Americans are on Medicaid, more than twice the number of federal student loan borrowers. It seems to me this is a bad political policy. 

Sorry this was so long, but I look forward to hearing some well thought out arguments in favor of SLF. Thanks."

My view is that these discussions should be contextualized by the reparations the US government actually paid to Japanese who were interned in camps during WWII. 

The simple fact is that nobody who is alive today in the United States was enslaved. Neither were their grandparents, or their great grandparents, or their great-great grandparents. That is not a wrong that can be effectively redressed today simply because nobody who is alive today was directly affected by it. 

However, there is very real systemic racism that occurred recently, in the 1960s federally and several years afterwards in individual states. 

Reparations are not something that I was initially receptive towards, but I have conceived a path forward on this matter. 

Japanese internees during WWII were paid a total of $1.6b in 1992. Adjusted for inflation, this amounted to just over $41,000 for every living person who had been interned. 

I don't know about you, but I personally believe that being interned by force in camps trumps anything black people encountered in the 1960s and beyond. So giving every black person alive today $40,000 is an insult to the Japanese internees. I don't think we can seriously say that being ripped from your home and forced into camps is better than being segregated by race. It's not in the same ballpark, and it's the closest this country has gotten to slavery since the Civil War. 

I would propose that every black person alive today be given a cash amount between $10,000 and $20,000. I've heard crazy proposals of giving black people $5 million, and I've of course heard arguments that no reparations are necessary. This is my compromise. 

And one could say that we shouldn't use the Japanese reparations as a baseline, because the Japanese internees should've been paid more. On that I agree. However, even if we had paid Japanese internees more, I don't believe that would raise the bar for black people subjected to segregation all that much. The simple fact of the matter remains that internment is a hell of a lot worse than segregation. 

So I would support $10,000 to $20,000 to every living black American today. I, who up until very recently thought reparations as a concept were absurd. 

I don't think you can find many people who would truly support more than that, nor is it even feasible to pay more than that. If you think inflation is bad now, just wait until 33 million people have an extra $10,000 in their pocket all at once. That would actually hurt the people reparations are trying to help in the long run."
